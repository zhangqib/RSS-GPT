<br />
Summary: In the context of training powerful image generators with adapters for personalized text-to-image synthesis, a common issue is the entanglement of target attributes with incidental factors in the input image. This problem limits generalization and adherence to the input text prompt. A solution proposed in this work is Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, where confounding factors are separated through auxiliary modules during training to prevent the adapter from internalizing them. These auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. This approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence in tasks like facial and full-body identity injection. The study suggests that establishing shortcuts for what should not be learned can lead to more disentangled representations in large models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should NOT be learned.

<div> Video-As-Prompt, semantic control, video generation, largest dataset, generalizable<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach called Video-As-Prompt (VAP) for semantic-controlled video generation, aiming to address the challenge of unified, generalizable semantic control. VAP leverages a reference video as a semantic prompt to guide a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This approach prevents catastrophic forgetting and eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. The authors also introduce VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation, containing over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. VAP achieves a user preference rate of 38.7%, competing with leading condition-specific commercial models. It demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports various downstream applications, marking a significant advancement in general-purpose, controllable video generation. <div>

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

<div> Keywords: medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks, transformers, focal modulation, bidirectional feature fusion<br />
Summary:<br />
Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, providing vital information for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have advanced segmentation tasks, capturing global context and long-range dependencies remains a challenge due to their local operation. To address this, a novel approach is proposed - the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network (FM-BFF-Net), which combines CNNs and transformers. The network utilizes a focal modulation attention mechanism for refined context awareness and a bidirectional feature fusion module for efficient encoder-decoder representation interaction across scales. FM-BFF-Net excels in boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the network's superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient. The adaptability and effectiveness of FM-BFF-Net make it a promising solution for various medical imaging scenarios.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges. To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios.

<div> Keywords: point tracking, uncertainty, generative model, multi-modality, occlusions

Summary: 
The article introduces Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a novel generative framework for tracking points in videos. This framework addresses the limitations of current discriminative models by capturing multi-modality in point trajectories. GenPT is trained using a flow matching formulation that combines iterative refinement, window-dependent priors, and a variance schedule specific to point coordinates. During inference, GenPT leverages its generative capabilities by employing a best-first search strategy on generated samples guided by its confidence in predictions. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GenPT outperforms existing discriminative trackers in tracking accuracy, particularly on occluded points. It excels in capturing the uncertainty and appearance changes that often challenge point tracking tasks in videos, making it a promising solution for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions. Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers, a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference, guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant discriminative point trackers.

arXiv:2510.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning" ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1) the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4) clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over 450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy, providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways, 3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<div> self-supervised learning, computer vision, adaptation, object-centric videos, VESSA<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces VESSA, a novel self-supervised adaptation method for visual foundation models that leverages multi-view object-centric videos for domain adaptation without annotations. VESSA utilizes a self-distillation paradigm and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to prevent forgetting pretrained knowledge. By incorporating object observations from different frames in videos, VESSA learns robustness to various capture conditions. Through experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA consistently outperforms base models and previous adaptation methods in downstream classification tasks. This approach addresses the challenge of distribution shifts and scarce labels in domains where supervised fine-tuning is impractical, offering a promising solution for model adaptation in computer vision tasks. The code for VESSA is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes. Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Summary: 
ZING-3D is a new framework designed for generating structured scene representations in complex 3D environments. It utilizes pretrained foundation models to achieve open-vocabulary recognition and create a detailed semantic scene graph without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. The framework supports incremental updates as new observations are made and provides explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for robotics applications. By leveraging VLM reasoning, ZING-3D generates a rich 2D scene graph that is then grounded in 3D using depth information. Nodes in the scene graph represent objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relationships between objects along with inter-object distances. Experimental results on Replica and HM3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ZING-3D in capturing spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training.

arXiv:2510.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D, a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

Summary:
WaveSeg introduces a novel decoder architecture that optimizes feature refinement in both spatial and wavelet domains. The model first learns high-frequency components from input images to enhance boundary details. A Dual Domain Operation (DDO) mechanism is used for multi-scale fusion, along with the Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block for long-range modeling. Reparameterized convolutions are applied to preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. A residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features and boundary-aware representations to produce rich feature maps. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that WaveSeg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and precision in semantic segmentation tasks. <div>

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically, high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Summary: <br />
Hirschsprung's disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in parts of the colon, causing obstruction. Accurate diagnosis and treatment rely on identifying regions of the myenteric plexus on tissue slides. Traditional deep learning approaches lack interpretability for physicians. A new framework integrating textual concepts from expert sources into a vision-language model shows promise. By aligning semantic cues with visual features, the model achieved superior classification performance compared to CNN-based models like VGG-19 and ResNet. The proposed model obtained an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 86.6%, and specificity of 87.6%. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and emphasizes the importance of incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant outputs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources (e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models, including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively. Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

<div> Keywords: Visual reasoning, Multimodal large language models, Active Visual Reasoning, Interactive environments, Embodied reasoning

Summary: 
The article introduces the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, which extends visual reasoning to interactive environments where information is incomplete or occluded. Inspired by human capabilities, AVR requires agents to actively acquire information through physical actions, integrate observations across multiple steps, and adjust decisions based on visual feedback. The CLEVR-AVR benchmark and the AVR-152k dataset are introduced to evaluate reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. The PhysVLM-AVR model, an MLLM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visual reasoning tasks. However, the analysis reveals that current embodied MLLMs struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, indicating a gap in active reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception, reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap in active reasoning capabilities.

<title>Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility</title>

<div> Keywords: HD maps, LiDAR, change detection, object-centric, uncertainty-aware.

Summary: 
An object-centric, uncertainty-aware pipeline for city-scale LiDAR data is proposed for high-definition mapping and change detection. The method aligns LiDAR data from different time points, normalizes height, and uses geometry proxies for cross-epoch associations. It employs semantic and instance segmentation with bipartite assignment to handle splits and merges while preserving class information. Tiled processing limits memory usage without compromising detection accuracy. Instance-level decisions are based on 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences, with a histogram distance gate. The method achieves high accuracy, mF1, and mIoU on Subiaco blocks, outperforming existing approaches, with a significant improvement on detecting 'Decreased' areas. Uncertainty estimation and object-level detection calibration enhance the reliability of change detection in urban environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins, and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

<div> dynamic priors, fine-tuning paradigm, segmentation tasks, Controllable-LPMoE, object segmentation

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel fine-tuning paradigm, Controllable-LPMoE, for adapting large-scale foundation models to specific object segmentation tasks efficiently. Traditional full-parameter fine-tuning processes lead to high computational overhead due to updating numerous parameters. The proposed Controllable-LPMoE approach reduces trainable parameters by dynamically modulating frozen models with local priors, enhancing fine-grained perception for segmentation tasks. This is achieved through a dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures diverse local priors and a gating network to output expert priors for fine-tuning. Additionally, a bi-directional interaction adapter utilizing deformable attention and adaptive scale enhancement facilitates efficient interaction and restructuring between frozen and trainable features. Extensive experiments showcase the superior segmentation performance of Controllable-LPMoE compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods and its adaptability across multiple binary object segmentation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our \href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE} approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object segmentation tasks.

<div> Keywords: image safety, SafetyPairs, counterfactual pairs, vision-language models, data augmentation

Summary:
SafetyPairs is introduced as a framework for generating pairs of images that differ only in safety-relevant features, allowing for the systematic study of fine-grained image safety distinctions. By leveraging image editing models, targeted changes can be made to images to flip their safety labels while keeping safety-irrelevant details intact. A new safety benchmark, consisting of over 3,020 SafetyPair images across 9 safety categories, is constructed to evaluate the abilities of vision-language models in distinguishing subtly different images. The benchmark not only highlights weaknesses in these models but also serves as a data augmentation strategy to enhance the training efficiency of lightweight guard models. This comprehensive resource provides a systematic approach to understanding and evaluating image safety, offering valuable insights into the complexities of identifying unsafe images. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020 SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Multimodal Large Language Models, NoisyGRPO, Bayesian Framework 

Summary: 
NoisyGRPO is a novel multimodal reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the general Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by introducing controllable noise into visual inputs for improved exploration and by explicitly modeling the advantage estimation process through a Bayesian framework. The framework consists of a Noise-Injected Exploration Policy, which perturbs visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration, and a Bayesian Advantage Estimation method that formulates advantage estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. By incorporating both noise-based exploration and Bayesian advantage estimation, NoisyGRPO improves the generalization and robustness of MLLMs in various CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, especially in settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B. This approach effectively guides MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones, leading to significant performance enhancements in RL tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) \textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Summary:<br />
- Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases, but its use of iodinated contrast agents carries risks.
- A new method, Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA), generated from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, showed superior performance in image quality and vessel enhancement.

- DCCTPA demonstrated valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity, and preservation of structures.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on 249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics (For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization, demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70, 0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Summary:<br />
The article addresses the challenge of integrating and verifying spatial intelligence in foundation models. It introduces the Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) as a structured schema to encode object layouts and relations, providing a faithful representation of scene structure. SIG-informed evaluation metrics quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, separating spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with multimodal LLMs, SIG yields larger, more stable gains compared to VQA-only representations. The article also presents SIGBench, a benchmark dataset for machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework that improves high-fidelity data generation. BFM partitions the generative trajectory into smaller specialized velocity blocks, increasing efficiency and sample quality. The framework incorporates a Semantic Feature Guidance module to condition velocity blocks on semantically rich features. A Feature Residual Approximation strategy is proposed to reduce inference cost while preserving semantic quality. Experiments on ImageNet 256x256 show that BFM outperforms existing Flow Matching methods, achieving accelerations in inference complexity with comparable generation performance. The code for implementing BFM is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2510.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data. Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval, improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

<div> Keywords: TokenCLIP, anomaly detection, zero-shot learning, dynamic alignment, optimal transport problem

Summary:<br /><br />
TokenCLIP is a framework proposed for anomaly detection on unseen objects in a zero-shot manner. Unlike existing methods that rely on a single textual space for alignment, TokenCLIP allows for dynamic alignment between visual and textual spaces at a token-wise level. By assigning each token to a customized textual subspace based on its visual characteristics, TokenCLIP enables fine-grained anomaly learning. The framework expands the token-agnostic textual space into orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assigns tokens to subspaces guided by semantic similarity, improving efficiency and customization. This dynamic alignment is formulated as an optimal transport problem, ensuring optimization across subspaces and encouraging focus on different semantics. The resulting transport plan adaptsively assigns tokens to semantically relevant subspaces and sparsifies the plan to specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCLIP in anomaly detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Summary: <br />
Shortcut models offer a new approach to generative modeling but have faced performance issues. This paper addresses five key challenges limiting the adoption of shortcut models.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts; (2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4) divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5) curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges, we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

<div> Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner, 3D meshes, Discrete Diffusion Models, parallel generation <br />
Summary: <br />
Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR) is introduced as a method for generating high-quality 3D artist-style meshes based on Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs). TSSR enables parallel generation by allowing all mesh tokens to be seen concurrently, enhancing efficiency and control. Three key innovations are implemented: Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which separates generation into topology sculpting and shape refinement stages; an Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and Rotational Positional Embeddings for richer contextual information; and a Connection Loss for topological constraint. TSSR produces high-quality 3D meshes with up to 10,000 faces at a spatial resolution of $1024^3, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on complex datasets. The code for TSSR will be available at the provided GitHub link. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of $1024^3$. The code will be released at: https://github.com/psky1111/Tencent-TSSR.

<br />Summary: SAGE-3D introduces a new paradigm called Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments for 3D Navigation, enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). By adding fine-grained object annotations and physics-aware execution jointing, SAGE-3D improves the realism and executability of 3DGS scenes. The InteriorGS dataset offers 1K object-annotated indoor scenes, while the SAGE-Bench benchmark provides 2M VLN data for evaluation. Experiment results show that 3DGS data is challenging yet offers strong generalizability, boosting performance by 31% on the VLN-CE Unseen task. Access to the data and code will be available soon. <br /> <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this, we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable, semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data. Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement learning framework for segmenting extremely small objects in high-resolution images. The framework consists of Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) stages for precise object localization. A locate-informed retrospective reward couples the stages for more robust exploration. Additionally, a new dataset \textsc{FineRS}-4k is presented for evaluating MLLMs on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. % Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle, small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on \textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

<div> - Keywords: vision-language models, interpretability, alignment, sparse autoencoder, multi-modal representations

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that enhances the interpretability of vision-language representations in current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By mapping representations into a unified concept set, VL-SAE correlates each hidden neuron to a specific concept represented by similar images and texts. This alignment is achieved through explicit cosine similarity-based alignment and consistent neuron activations during training. VL-SAE outperforms existing VLMs like CLIP and LLaVA in both interpretation and enhancement of vision-language alignment. The interpretability aspect allows for understanding representation semantics through concepts, while the enhancement aspect strengthens alignment at the concept level. This leads to improved performance in tasks like zero-shot image classification and reducing hallucinations. The code for VL-SAE is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced changes in three-dimensional cellular structure.
- FORM consists of a morphology encoder and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module, trained on a large-scale dataset of 3D cell volumes.
- It supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional simulation of perturbed cell states, as well as predicting downstream signalling activity and simulating combinatorial perturbation effects.
- An evaluation benchmarking suite, MorphoEval, quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural, statistical, and biological dimensions.

arXiv:2510.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000 multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural, statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions, poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions. Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate localization information from the template. The limitation results in suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/zxyyxzz/DSATrack.

Summary:
This work introduces a gaze-regularized framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for egocentric understanding tasks. By incorporating human gaze during training, a gaze-regularized attention mechanism aligns model focus with visual gaze, improving semantic prediction scores for future event prediction and current activity understanding. Compared to baseline models trained without gaze regularization, the proposed approach achieves up to 11 improvement in future event prediction and around 7 improvement in current activity understanding. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world applications such as assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular, allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

Summary: 
The study presented a unified pipeline for generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI and CBCT images using a 2.5D U-Net++ model with a ResNet-34 encoder. The model was trained on normalized, body-masked inputs with a combination of pixel-wise L1 loss and perceptual losses. Training utilized patch-based inputs with random flipping and no post-processing. Test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling were used for final predictions. The study compared two registration strategies, Elastix and IMPACT, finding that IMPACT-based registration resulted in more accurate and anatomically consistent alignments and improved sCT synthesis on local test sets. However, models trained with Elastix-aligned data performed better on the public validation set due to a registration bias in the evaluation pipeline. The study highlighted the importance of anatomically consistent alignment in sCT synthesis models to mitigate bias and improve overall performance and anatomical fidelity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder, trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256 for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information, consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures. On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment, IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and generalizable sCT synthesis models.

In this work, a novel framework is proposed to enhance the generation quality of diffusion models based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models typically produce high-fidelity images without consideration for downstream transmission limitations, resulting in wasted computation and loss of fine textures during heavy compression. The proposed approach introduces a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model adjusts its denoising process according to the available bandwidth, enabling early-stop sampling to maintain visual quality appropriate for the transmission condition. By incorporating a lightweight quality embedding, the model learns to modulate the denoising trajectory efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in visual fidelity compared to naive early-stopping, promising efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework designed to address the challenges of generating remote sensing imagery for various vision tasks. It introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder, multi-scale injection scheme, and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints and details. A large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset is constructed to evaluate TerraGen, showing superior image quality across tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple, interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction. Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

This paper presents a novel depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method to address ghosting and misalignment issues caused by large parallax in multi-perspective image synthesis. The proposed method utilizes a multi-stage mechanism with global depth regularization constraints for accurate alignment across different depth ranges. An optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to locate transition areas precisely, ensuring natural and seamless stitching results. A reparameterization strategy is incorporated to optimize computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in the stitched results. To address this, we propose a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval (MUVR) task, along with a new benchmark aimed at advancing video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR supports practical video-centric multi-modal queries and focuses on retrieving untrimmed videos using fine-grained criteria.

The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluation criteria, involving three versions to assess retrieval models and MLLMs in a question-answering format. MUVR consists of a dataset comprising 53K untrimmed videos with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Evaluations are conducted on state-of-the-art video retrieval models, image-based VLMs, and MLLMs, revealing limitations in processing untrimmed videos, multi-modal queries, and multi-video understanding and reranking abilities.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at https://github.com/debby-0527/MUVR.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ArtiLatent, a generative framework for synthesizing human-made 3D objects with detailed geometry and realistic appearance. It uses a variational autoencoder to model part geometry and articulation dynamics, embedding them into a unified latent space. A latent diffusion model allows for diverse and physically plausible sampling. An articulation-aware Gaussian decoder reconstructs photorealistic 3D shapes by considering articulation-dependent visibility changes. This method improves visual realism by assigning texture features to occluded regions based on articulation state. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtiLatent achieves superior results in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a scalable solution for creating and manipulating articulated 3D objects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the utilization of table look-up for implementing image restoration CNNs, aiming to achieve competitive image quality with enhanced speed and resource efficiency. The main challenge lies in effectively managing the table size without restricting the receptive field. Current strategies involve reusing tables for small pixel patches of various orientations and fusing the results through average pooling, which is not ideal for anisotropic signal structures. The study explores anisotropic pooling methods as an alternative to average pooling, introducing generalized median pooling and data-dependent pooling coefficients for adaptively weighing contributions from different orientations. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic pooling strategy significantly improves the performance of existing LUT-realizable CNN methods, yielding perceptually and numerically superior results. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First, we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Summary: <br />
Modeling hierarchical structures in 3D objects and scenes is crucial for autonomous agents. Existing methods struggle with implicit representations due to increased inference time or poor generalization with predefined hierarchies. To address this, OpenHype introduces a novel approach using a continuous hyperbolic latent space. Leveraging hyperbolic geometry, it encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies. OpenHype outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, showcasing superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding. <div>

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data, especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin, synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<div> Keywords: Video Anomaly Detection, Online VAD, Large Language Models, Memory-based scoring queue, Training-free

Summary:  
MoniTor is a novel online Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for real-time anomaly detection. The system utilizes a Memory-based scoring queue to process streaming input efficiently and incorporate a prediction mechanism inspired by LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies. By dynamically storing recent scores and incorporating an anomaly prior, MoniTor effectively distinguishes between normal and abnormal behaviors in surveillance videos. Evaluation on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets shows that MoniTor outperforms existing methods and achieves competitive performance without the need for explicit training. The code for MoniTor is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.  <div>
arXiv:2510.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame. Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available at https://github.com/YsTvT/MoniTor.

<div> image-to-video priors, temporal consistency, video inpainting, spatial coherence, motion stability

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called VidSplice for video inpainting. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by decoupling the inpainting process into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. This approach uses spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with spatiotemporal cues. The framework includes a CoSpliced Module for first-frame propagation and a context controller module for encoding coherent priors and controlling content distortion. VidSplice improves spatial coherence, foreground alignment, and motion stability, outperforming existing approaches in diverse video inpainting scenarios. The framework effectively controls content distortion during generation, resulting in more stable and coherent inpainted videos. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of VidSplice across various scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover, its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces CXR-LanIC, a framework for interpretability in deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis. The framework uses transcoder-based sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable visual patterns from medical image representations. By training on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, the framework discovers approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns related to cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern shows consistent activation behavior across images with similar radiological features, allowing for transparent attributions in predictions. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on key findings and lays the foundation for natural language explanations. Notably, the framework extracts features from a classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives, ensuring relevance to clinical decision-making. This approach demonstrates that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent, verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings, ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making, demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations.

Summary:
Accurate interpretation of histopathological images requires integration of information across different scales, from cellular textures to overall tissue organization. Current pathology models lack cell-level feature modeling, hindering fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification. To address this limitation, a dual-stream architecture is proposed to capture the interplay between tissue features and cellular representations. A receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model efficiently aggregates information from large cell sets, while a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module enables mutual attention between cellular cues and the surrounding tissue environment. Experimental results on four subtype classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models, highlighting the importance of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction in computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns. Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method, ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience, leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n), based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a 13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding significant clinical application value.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance (FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of adaptive design.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes. Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

<title>Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581</link>

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio modalities (e.g., speech).

<title>Sample By Step, Optimize By Chunk: Chunk-Level GRPO For Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21583</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

<title>MATrack: Efficient Multiscale Adaptive Tracker for Real-Time Nighttime UAV Operations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21586</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities, but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties, researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and 4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS. Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability, demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search and rescue and border patrol.

<title>Restore Text First, Enhance Image Later: Two-Stage Scene Text Image Super-Resolution with Glyph Structure Guidance</title>

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER} (\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm. \textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement: it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}). Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving overall image quality.

<title>Automated interictal epileptic spike detection from simple and noisy annotations in MEG data</title>

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

arXiv:2510.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000 high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities. However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<title>DAP-MAE: Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder for Effective Cross-Domain Learning</title>

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE), an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks, reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus.

<title>A Dynamic Knowledge Distillation Method Based on the Gompertz Curve</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework, Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation. Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in the wild.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51% baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion, motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss), demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for 'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse structure.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.

arXiv:2510.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world -- large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance. Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation. Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset, WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world models.

arXiv:2510.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box" predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?modelId=doubao-seed3d-1-0-250928&amp;tab=Gen3D

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000 TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations: original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space. Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of 0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance. These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where traditional imaging is unavailable.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180 chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and 1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time, time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives (n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s (p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations. We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy, from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

<title>More Than Memory Savings: Zeroth-Order Optimization Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors, comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA.

Abstract: Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen (https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and, in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement (AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder (APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion. We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data. We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the powerful LLM to perform multimodal tasks, showing amazing emergent abilities in recent studies, such as writing poems based on an image. However, it is difficult for these case studies to fully reflect the performance of MLLM, lacking a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we fill in this blank, presenting the first comprehensive MLLM Evaluation benchmark MME. It measures both perception and cognition abilities on a total of 14 subtasks. In order to avoid data leakage that may arise from direct use of public datasets for evaluation, the annotations of instruction-answer pairs are all manually designed. The concise instruction design allows us to fairly compare MLLMs, instead of struggling in prompt engineering. Besides, with such an instruction, we can also easily carry out quantitative statistics. A total of 30 advanced MLLMs are comprehensively evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the subsequent model optimization. The data are released at the project page https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation.

Abstract: Multispectral pedestrian detection achieves better visibility in challenging conditions and thus is essential to autonomous driving, for which both the accuracy and computational cost are of paramount importance. Most existing approaches treat RGB and infrared modalities equally. They typically adopt two symmetrical backbones for multimodal feature extraction, which ignore the substantial differences between modalities and bring great difficulty for the reduction of the computational cost as well as effective crossmodal fusion. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework named Wavelet-context Cooperative Network (WCCNet) that is able to differentially extract complementary features of different spectra with lower computational complexity, and further fuse these diverse features based on their spatially relevant crossmodal semantics. In particular, WCCNet simultaneously explore wavelet context and RGB textures within a cooperative dual-stream backbone, which is composed of adaptive discrete wavelet transform (ADWT) layers and heavyweight neural layers. The ADWT layers extract frequency components for infrared modality, while neural layers handle RGB modality features. Since ADWT layers are lightweight and extract complementary features, this cooperative structure not only significantly reduces the computational complexity, but also facilitates the subsequent crossmodal fusion. To further fuse these infrared and RGB features with significant semantic differences, we elaborately design the crossmodal rearranging fusion module (CMRF), which can mitigate spatial misalignment and merge semantically complementary features in spatially-related local regions to amplify the crossmodal reciprocal information. Experimental results on KAIST and FLIR benchmarks indicate that WCCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with considerable efficiency and competitive accuracy.

<title>Circle Representation for Medical Instance Object Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recently, circle representation has been introduced for medical imaging, designed specifically to enhance the detection of instance objects that are spherically shaped (e.g., cells, glomeruli, and nuclei). Given its outstanding effectiveness in instance detection, it is compelling to consider the application of circle representation for segmenting instance medical objects. In this study, we introduce CircleSnake, a simple end-to-end segmentation approach that utilizes circle contour deformation for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects at the instance level. The innovation of CircleSnake lies in these three areas: (1) It substitutes the complex bounding box-to-octagon contour transformation with a more consistent and rotation-invariant bounding circle-to-circle contour adaptation. This adaptation specifically targets ball-shaped medical objects. (2) The circle representation employed in CircleSnake significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to two, compared to eight in the octagon representation. This reduction enhances both the robustness of the segmentation performance and the rotational consistency of the method. (3) CircleSnake is the first end-to-end deep instance segmentation pipeline to incorporate circle representation, encompassing consistent circle detection, circle contour proposal, and circular convolution in a unified framework. This integration is achieved through the novel application of circular graph convolution within the context of circle detection and instance segmentation. In practical applications, such as the detection of glomeruli, nuclei, and eosinophils in pathological images, CircleSnake has demonstrated superior performance and greater rotation invariance when compared to benchmarks. The code has been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/CircleSnake.

Abstract: The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/modelscope/facechain/tree/main/face_module/TopoFR.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification. Those works test how much a trained DNN relies on specific image cues like texture. The present study shifts the focus to understanding the cue influence during training, analyzing what DNNs can learn from shape, texture, and color cues in absence of the others; investigating their individual and combined influence on the learning success. We analyze these cue influences at multiple levels by decomposing datasets into cue-specific versions. Addressing semantic segmentation, we learn the given task from these reduced cue datasets, creating cue experts. Early fusion of cues is performed by constructing appropriate datasets. This is complemented by a late fusion of experts which allows us to study cue influence location-dependent on pixel level. Experiments on Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and a synthetic CARLA dataset show that while no single cue dominates, the shape + color expert predominantly improves the prediction of small objects and border pixels. The cue performance order is consistent for the tested convolutional and transformer architecture, indicating similar cue extraction capabilities, although pre-trained transformers are said to be more biased towards shape than convolutional neural networks.

Abstract: Point cloud synthesis, i.e. the generation of novel point clouds from an input distribution, remains a challenging task, for which numerous complex machine learning models have been devised. We develop a novel method that encodes geometrical-topological characteristics of point clouds using inner products, leading to a highly-efficient point cloud representation with provable expressivity properties. Integrated into deep learning models, our encoding exhibits high quality in typical tasks like reconstruction, generation, and interpolation, with inference times orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: We present InfiniDreamer, a novel framework for arbitrarily long human motion generation. InfiniDreamer addresses the limitations of current motion generation methods, which are typically restricted to short sequences due to the lack of long motion training data. To achieve this, we first generate sub-motions corresponding to each textual description and then assemble them into a coarse, extended sequence using randomly initialized transition segments. We then introduce an optimization-based method called Segment Score Distillation (SSD) to refine the entire long motion sequence. SSD is designed to utilize an existing motion prior, which is trained only on short clips, in a training-free manner. Specifically, SSD iteratively refines overlapping short segments sampled from the coarsely extended long motion sequence, progressively aligning them with the pre-trained motion diffusion prior. This process ensures local coherence within each segment, while the refined transitions between segments maintain global consistency across the entire sequence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the superiority of our framework, showcasing its ability to generate coherent, contextually aware motion sequences of arbitrary length.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across domains. However, their application to image classification remains limited, often requiring billion-scale datasets to be competitive. In this work, we explore the integration of MoE layers into image classification architectures using open datasets. We conduct a systematic analysis across different MoE configurations and model scales. We find that moderate parameter activation per sample provides the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, as the number of activated parameters increases, the benefits of MoE diminish. Our analysis yields several practical insights for vision MoE design. First, MoE layers most effectively strengthen tiny and mid-sized models, while gains taper off for large-capacity networks and do not redefine state-of-the-art ImageNet performance. Second, a Last-2 placement heuristic offers the most robust cross-architecture choice, with Every-2 slightly better for Vision Transform (ViT), and both remaining effective as data and model scale increase. Third, larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k) allow more experts, up to 16, for ConvNeXt to be utilized effectively without changing placement, as increased data reduces overfitting and promotes broader expert specialization. Finally, a simple linear router performs best, suggesting that additional routing complexity yields no consistent benefit.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.

<title>DynamicPAE: Generating Scene-Aware Physical Adversarial Examples in Real-Time</title>

Abstract: Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as whistle-blowers of real-world risks in deep-learning applications, thus worth further investigation. However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes, revealing the urgent requirement of dynamic PAEs that are generated in real time and conditioned on the observation from the attacker. The key challenge in generating dynamic PAEs is learning the sparse relation between PAEs and the observation of attackers under the noisy feedback of attack training. To address the challenge, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks. Specifically, to address the noisy feedback problem that obfuscates the exploration of scene-related PAEs, we introduce the residual-guided adversarial pattern exploration technique. Residual-guided training, which relaxes the attack training with a reconstruction task, is proposed to enrich the feedback information, thereby achieving a more comprehensive exploration of PAEs. To address the alignment problem between the trained generator and the real-world scenario, we introduce the distribution-matched attack scenario alignment, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former aligns the training environment with the incomplete observation of the real-world attacker. The latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets with the skewness controller. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 2.07 $\times$ boost (58.8% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., DETR) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods. Overall, our work opens the door to end-to-end modeling of dynamic PAEs.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that exhibit transferability across various models. Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results. In addition, we introduce a newly-annotated FineDiving-Pose Dataset to improve the current low-quality human pose labels. In experiments, the results on FineDiving and MTL-AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. Our source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Lumos0507/HP-MCoRe.

Abstract: We present RigAnything, a novel autoregressive transformer-based model, which makes 3D assets rig-ready by probabilistically generating joints and skeleton topologies and assigning skinning weights in a template-free manner. Unlike most existing auto-rigging methods, which rely on predefined skeleton templates and are limited to specific categories like humanoid, RigAnything approaches the rigging problem in an autoregressive manner, iteratively predicting the next joint based on the global input shape and the previous prediction. While autoregressive models are typically used to generate sequential data, RigAnything extends its application to effectively learn and represent skeletons, which are inherently tree structures. To achieve this, we organize the joints in a breadth-first search (BFS) order, enabling the skeleton to be defined as a sequence of 3D locations and the parent index. Furthermore, our model improves the accuracy of position prediction by leveraging diffusion modeling, ensuring precise and consistent placement of joints within the hierarchy. This formulation allows the autoregressive model to efficiently capture both spatial and hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. Trained end-to-end on both RigNet and Objaverse datasets, RigAnything demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse object types, including humanoids, quadrupeds, marine creatures, insects, and many more, surpassing prior methods in quality, robustness, generalizability, and efficiency. It achieves significantly faster performance than existing auto-rigging methods, completing rigging in under a few seconds per shape.

Abstract: Visual generative and understanding models typically rely on distinct tokenizers to process images, presenting a key challenge for unifying them within a single framework. Recent studies attempt to address this by connecting the training of VQVAE (for autoregressive generation) and CLIP (for understanding) to build a unified tokenizer. However, directly combining these training objectives has been observed to cause severe loss conflicts. In this paper, we show that reconstruction and semantic supervision do not inherently conflict. Instead, the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete token space. Building on these insights, we introduce UniTok, a unified tokenizer featuring a novel multi-codebook quantization mechanism that effectively scales up the vocabulary size and bottleneck dimension. In terms of final performance, UniTok sets a new record of 0.38 rFID and 78.6% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Besides, UniTok can be seamlessly integrated into MLLMs to unlock native visual generation capability, without compromising the understanding performance. Additionally, we show that UniTok favors cfg-free generation, reducing gFID from 14.6 to 2.5 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. GitHub: https://github.com/FoundationVision/UniTok.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on large-scale datasets in machine learning poses significant privacy and ethical challenges, particularly in sensitive domains such as face recognition. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative; however, most existing methods depend heavily on external datasets or pre-trained models, increasing complexity and resource demands. In this paper, we introduce AugGen, a self-contained synthetic augmentation technique. AugGen strategically samples from a class-conditional generative model trained exclusively on the target FR dataset, eliminating the need for external resources. Evaluated across 8 FR benchmarks, including IJB-C and IJB-B, our method achieves 1-12% performance improvements, outperforming models trained solely on real data and surpassing state-of-the-art synthetic data generation approaches, while using less real data. Notably, these gains often exceed those from architectural enhancements, underscoring the value of synthetic augmentation in data-limited scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that carefully integrated synthetic data can both mitigate privacy constraints and substantially enhance recognition performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) often suffers from degradations such as low spatial resolution, sensor noise, motion blur, and adverse illumination. These factors diminish feature distinctiveness, leading to ambiguous object representations and inadequate foreground-background separation. Existing RSOD methods exhibit limitations in robust detection of low-quality objects. To address these pressing challenges, we introduce LEGNet, a lightweight backbone network featuring a novel Edge-Gaussian Aggregation (EGA) module specifically engineered to enhance feature representation derived from low-quality remote sensing images. EGA module integrates: (a) orientation-aware Scharr filters to sharpen crucial edge details often lost in low-contrast or blurred objects, and (b) Gaussian-prior-based feature refinement to suppress noise and regularize ambiguous feature responses, enhancing foreground saliency under challenging conditions. EGA module alleviates prevalent problems in reduced contrast, structural discontinuities, and ambiguous feature responses prevalent in degraded images, effectively improving model robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0, and VisDrone2019) demonstrate that LEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in detecting low-quality objects.The code is available at https://github.com/AeroVILab-AHU/LEGNet.

It categorizes automatic change detection methods into four main families: rule-based, statistical, machine learning, and simulation methods. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of every family are discussed in the context of various input data. Then, key applications for National Mapping Agencies are identified, particularly the optimization of geospatial database updating, change-based phenomena, and dynamics monitoring. Finally, the paper highlights the current challenges for leveraging change detection such as the variability of change definition, the missing of relevant large-scale datasets, the diversity of input data, the unstudied no-change detection, the human in the loop integration and the operational constraints. The discussion underscores the necessity for ongoing innovation in change detection techniques to address the future needs of geographic information systems for national mapping agencies.

Abstract: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Despite domain-adaptive object detectors based on CNN and transformers have made significant progress in cross-domain detection tasks, it is regrettable that domain adaptation for real-time transformer-based detectors has not yet been explored. Directly applying existing domain adaptation algorithms has proven to be suboptimal. In this paper, we propose RT-DATR, a simple and efficient real-time domain adaptive detection transformer. Building on RT-DETR as our base detector, we first introduce a local object-level feature alignment module to significantly enhance the feature representation of domain invariance during object transfer. Additionally, we introduce a scene semantic feature alignment module designed to boost cross-domain detection performance by aligning scene semantic features. Finally, we introduced a domain query and decoupled it from the object query to further align the instance feature distribution within the decoder layer, reduce the domain gap, and maintain discriminative ability. Experimental results on various cross-domian benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Jeremy-lf/RT-DATR.

Abstract: Idling vehicle detection (IVD) uses surveillance video and multichannel audio to localize and classify vehicles in the last frame as moving, idling, or engine-off in pick-up zones. IVD faces three challenges: (i) modality heterogeneity between visual cues and audio patterns; (ii) large box scale variation requiring multi-resolution detection; and (iii) training instability due to coupled detection heads. The previous end-to-end (E2E) model with simple CBAM-based bi-modal attention fails to handle these issues and often misses vehicles. We propose HAVT-IVD, a heterogeneity-aware network with a visual feature pyramid and decoupled heads. Experiments show HAVT-IVD improves mAP by 7.66 over the disjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline.

Abstract: Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller e.g., a vision language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Existing approaches for training these agents, both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, depend on extensive human-annotated task-answer pairs and tool trajectories. However, for complex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or impractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage exploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool usage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective tool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating the bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first synthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel trajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent tries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification, we employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage through preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks shows that the SPORT agent achieves 6.41% and 3.64% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at: https://github.com/LJungang/RTV-Bench.

<title>Register and [CLS] tokens yield a decoupling of local and global features in large ViTs</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2 model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the [CLS] token itself leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behavior to register and [CLS] tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.

<title>MELLM: Exploring LLM-Powered Micro-Expression Understanding Enhanced by Subtle Motion Perception</title>

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs), brief and low-intensity facial movements revealing concealed emotions, are crucial for affective computing. Despite notable progress in ME recognition, existing methods are largely confined to discrete emotion classification, lacking the capacity for comprehensive ME Understanding (MEU), particularly in interpreting subtle facial dynamics and underlying emotional cues. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential for MEU with their advanced reasoning abilities, they still struggle to perceive such subtle facial affective behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a ME Large Language Model (MELLM) that integrates optical flow-based sensitivity to subtle facial motions with the powerful inference ability of LLMs. Specifically, an iterative, warping-based optical-flow estimator, named MEFlowNet, is introduced to precisely capture facial micro-movements. For its training and evaluation, we construct MEFlowDataset, a large-scale optical-flow dataset with 54,611 onset-apex image pairs spanning diverse identities and subtle facial motions. Subsequently, we design a Flow-Guided Micro-Expression Understanding paradigm. Under this framework, the optical flow signals extracted by MEFlowNet are leveraged to build MEU-Instruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for MEU. MELLM is then fine-tuned on MEU-Instruct, enabling it to translate subtle motion patterns into human-readable descriptions and generate corresponding emotional inferences. Experiments demonstrate that MEFlowNet significantly outperforms existing optical flow methods in facial and ME-flow estimation, while MELLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across multiple ME benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents two key contributions: MEFlowNet as the first dedicated ME flow estimator, and MELLM as the first LLM tailored for MEU.

<title>Breaking the Batch Barrier (B3) of Contrastive Learning via Smart Batch Mining</title>

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a prevalent technique for training embedding models, which pulls semantically similar examples (positives) closer in the representation space while pushing dissimilar ones (negatives) further apart. A key source of negatives are 'in-batch' examples, i.e., positives from other examples in the batch. Effectiveness of such models is hence strongly influenced by the size and quality of training batches. In this work, we propose 'Breaking the Batch Barrier' (B3), a novel batch construction strategy designed to curate high-quality batches for CL. Our approach begins by using a pretrained teacher embedding model to rank all examples in the dataset, from which a sparse similarity graph is constructed. A community detection algorithm is then applied to this graph to identify clusters of examples that serve as strong negatives for one another. The clusters are then used to construct batches that are rich in in-batch negatives. Empirical results on the MMEB multimodal embedding benchmark (36 tasks) demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous best methods by +1.3 and +2.9 points at the 7B and 2B model scales, respectively. Notably, models trained with B3 surpass existing state-of-the-art results even with a batch size as small as 64, which is 4-16x smaller than that required by other methods. Moreover, experiments show that B3 generalizes well across domains and tasks, maintaining strong performance even when trained with considerably weaker teachers.

Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

<title>Pixel Reasoner: Incentivizing Pixel-Space Reasoning with Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data. The code is available at https://github.com/bryanwong17/HiVE-MIL.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs). Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn, spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Properly evaluating the ability of Video-Language Models (VLMs) to understand long videos remains a challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently addressed by existing benchmarks: (1) extracting information from two separate locations (two needles) in a long video and understanding them jointly, and (2) modeling the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Causal2Needles evaluates these abilities using noncausal one-needle, causal one-needle, and causal two-needle questions. The most complex question type, causal two-needle questions, require extracting information from both the cause and effect events from a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, we introduce two complementary question formats: locating the video clip containing the answer, and verbal description of a visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling on existing benchmarks struggle with causal 2-needle questions, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/causal2needles/Causal2Needles

Abstract: Controllability, temporal coherence, and detail synthesis remain the most critical challenges in video generation. In this paper, we focus on a commonly used yet underexplored cinematic technique known as Frame In and Frame Out. Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new identity references to enter the scene, guided by a user-specified motion trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset that is curated semi-automatically, an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this task. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where a first-person (egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object interactions, its narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person (exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views, yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini 2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus, there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to $7$ days lead time, which is of high relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture spatio-temporal relations in very large river networks and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates that RiverMamba provides reliable predictions of river discharge across various flood return periods, including extreme floods, and lead times, surpassing both AI- and physics-based models. The source code and datasets are publicly available at the project page https://hakamshams.github.io/RiverMamba.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation for rendering 3D scenes from 2D images and has been extended to images, videos, and dynamic 4D content. However, applying style transfer to GS-based representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging. In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussian, the first unified style transfer framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from scratch. The CLIPGaussian approach enables joint optimization of color and geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos, while preserving the model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussian as a universal and efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings. The code repository is available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/PatchGuard .

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation) representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties in T2I-generated contents. We released our code at https://github.com/tsingqguo/anglerocl.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is increasingly used in machine learning for training and data augmentation. Yet, current strategies often rely on external foundation models or datasets, whose usage is restricted in many scenarios due to policy or legal constraints. We propose ScoreMix, a self-contained synthetic generation method to produce hard synthetic samples for recognition tasks by leveraging the score compositionality of diffusion models. The approach mixes class-conditioned scores along reverse diffusion trajectories, yielding domain-specific data augmentation without external resources. We systematically study class-selection strategies and find that mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space yields larger gains, providing up to 3% additional average improvement, compared to selection based on proximity. Interestingly, we observe that condition and embedding spaces are largely uncorrelated under standard alignment metrics, and the generator's condition space has a negligible effect on downstream performance. Across 8 public face recognition benchmarks, ScoreMix improves accuracy by up to 7 percentage points, without hyperparameter search, highlighting both robustness and practicality. Our method provides a simple yet effective way to maximize discriminator performance using only the available dataset, without reliance on third-party resources.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Vanilla 3DGS heavily relies on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, achieving faster convergence while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Previous methods for image geo-localization have typically treated the task as either classification or retrieval, often relying on black-box decisions that lack interpretability. The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Localizability assessment and Optimized visual-cue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance localizability assessment, visual-cue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on geo-localization tasks, particularly in diverse visual scenes, while also generating more insightful and interpretable reasoning trajectories. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GLOBE.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception. Consisting of approximately 80K LiDAR frames and 360K images, the dataset covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts, highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 17% of the data comprises dynamic interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane changes. AGC-Drive contains 350 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation utilities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/PercepX/AGC-Drive.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding. While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based approaches utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first method that leverages context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art in-domain performance, exhibits superior zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain data, and achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14x. These results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1,800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation. The dataset and evaluation codes will be available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/MultiHuman-Testbench.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and fine-tuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Building on observations about the data scaling, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. Specifically, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

Our formulation extends previous discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a Raviart-Thomas function space. To extend this formulation to the manifold setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods in mesh denoising experiments.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction (DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps, stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches, especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available at https://github.com/528why/Dataset-Condensation-with-Color-Compensation.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuGS), a generalized feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time while enhancing rendering quality. MuGS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/EuclidLou/MuGS.

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow ($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a $\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost, regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive evaluations on the Argoverse 2, Waymo and nuScenes datasets show that $\Delta$Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$ faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model weights.

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision steps at virtual views in pixel and feature levels to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions, and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates competitive performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Abstract: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism, suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR-Flow. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data, posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes in the realm of unsupervised learning.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an \textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing applications.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

<title>NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aim to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided, perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic, mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring, these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats) and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate, confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures, avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180 degree view-point change rotation. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and local feature matching methods, by up to 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance mapping and object-relative navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in 3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision (e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\%. With just 10\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\% fine-tuning. ViTime also exhibits exceptional robustness, effectively handling missing data and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30\% under various data perturbations, validating the power of its visual space data operation paradigm.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable accuracy in medical image segmentation, particularly for larger structures with well-defined boundaries. However, its effectiveness can be challenged by factors such as irregular object shapes and edges, non-smooth surfaces, small target areas, etc. which complicate the ability of networks to grasp the intricate and diverse nature of anatomical regions. In response to these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Focal Loss (A-FL) that takes both object boundary smoothness and size into account, with the goal to improve segmentation performance in intricate anatomical regions. The proposed A-FL dynamically adjusts itself based on an object's surface smoothness, size, and the class balancing parameter based on the ratio of targeted area and background. We evaluated the performance of the A-FL on the PICAI 2022 and BraTS 2018 datasets. In the PICAI 2022 dataset, the A-FL achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.696 and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.769, outperforming the regular Focal Loss (FL) by 5.5% and 5.4% respectively. It also surpassed the best baseline by 2.0% and 1.2%. In the BraTS 2018 dataset, A-FL achieved an IoU score of 0.883 and a DSC score of 0.931. Our ablation experiments also show that the proposed A-FL surpasses conventional losses (this includes Dice Loss, Focal Loss, and their hybrid variants) by large margin in IoU, DSC, and other metrics.

Abstract: In the realm of neuroscience, identifying distinctive patterns associated with neurological disorders via brain networks is crucial. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs an inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information across brain regions. Experimental results on four datasets of different diseases demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AIDFusion compared to state-of-the-art methods. A case study illustrates AIDFusion extract patterns that are both interpretable and consistent with established neuroscience findings.

Abstract: As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an inherently multi-contrast modality, where cross-contrast priors can be exploited to improve image reconstruction from undersampled data. Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in MRI reconstruction. However, they still struggle to effectively utilize such priors, mainly because existing methods rely on feature-level fusion in image or latent spaces, which lacks explicit structural correspondence and thus leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion, a multi-contrast guided reconstruction framework based on the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB). The proposed method performs pixel-wise translation between paired contrasts, providing explicit structural constraints between the guidance and target images. Furthermore, an Inversion strategy is introduced to correct inter-modality misalignment, which often occurs in guided reconstruction, thereby mitigating artifacts and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on paired T1- and T2-weighted datasets demonstrate that $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion achieves a high acceleration factor of up to 14.4 and consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.

Abstract: Invisible Image Watermarking is crucial for ensuring content provenance and accountability in generative AI. While Gen-AI providers are increasingly integrating invisible watermarking systems, the robustness of these schemes against forgery attacks remains poorly characterized. This is critical, as forging traceable watermarks onto illicit content leads to false attribution, potentially harming the reputation and legal standing of Gen-AI service providers who are not responsible for the content. In this work, we propose WMCopier, an effective watermark forgery attack that operates without requiring any prior knowledge of or access to the target watermarking algorithm. Our approach first models the target watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model, and then seamlessly embeds the target watermark into a non-watermarked image via a shallow inversion process. We also incorporate an iterative optimization procedure that refines the reconstructed image to further trade off the fidelity and forgery efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that WMCopier effectively deceives both open-source and closed-source watermark systems (e.g., Amazon's system), achieving a significantly higher success rate than existing methods. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of forged samples and discuss the potential defenses against our attack.

arXiv:2504.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes. We release the source code at: https://github.com/Mkolahdoozi/Some-Optimizers-Are-More-Equal.

<title>Approximating Signed Distance Fields of Implicit Surfaces with Sparse Ellipsoidal Radial Basis Function Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02350</link>

arXiv:2505.02350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and compact representation of signed distance functions (SDFs) of implicit surfaces is crucial for efficient storage, computation, and downstream processing of 3D geometry. In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The corresponding executable program is publicly available at https://github.com/lianbobo/SE-RBFNet.git

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

<title>Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI models in Sound Localization</title>

Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we propose a neuroscience-inspired model, EchoPin, which uses a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, EchoPin surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.

KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies. Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling. Additional details at https://grasp2grasp.github.io/

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same number of parameters. We also find limited settings--namely fitting binary signals such as shape contours--where INRs outperform grids, to guide future development and use of INRs towards the most advantageous applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation, it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically, this term is either a KL divergence that matches marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss that captures intra- and inter-class relationships. In every case, it acts as an additional term to cross-entropy. This term has its own weight, which must be carefully tuned. In this paper, we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce "Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD)", a weighted list-wise ranking loss. In PLD, the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single "teacher-optimal" ranking. The true label is placed first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence. This process yields a convex and translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically, across CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS-COCO, PLD achieves consistent gains across diverse architectures and distillation objectives, including divergence-based, correlation-based, and feature-based methods, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

<title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gmum/MambaHoME.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers simplified training but suffers from residual magnitude decay in multi-stage settings, where subsequent stages receive exponentially weaker signals. We propose Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ), addressing this fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our experiments across audio and image modalities demonstrate RFSQ's effectiveness and generalizability. In audio reconstruction at 24 bits/frame, RFSQ-LayerNorm achieves 3.646 DNSMOS, a 3.6% improvement over state-of-the-art RVQ (3.518). On ImageNet, RFSQ achieves 0.102 L1 loss and 0.100 perceptual loss, with LayerNorm providing 9.7% L1 improvement and 17.4% perceptual improvement over unconditioned variants. The LayerNorm strategy consistently outperforms alternatives by maintaining normalized input statistics across stages, effectively preventing exponential magnitude decay that limits naive residual approaches. RFSQ combines FSQ's simplicity with multi-stage quantization's representational power, establishing a new standard for neural compression across diverse modalities.

arXiv:2510.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have led to notable progress in creating high-quality videos from static images, particularly focusing on human-centric applications. However, maintaining identity consistency in generated videos remains a challenge, especially when the subject undergoes significant expression changes or movements. To address this issue, a novel approach called Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) is proposed. This framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize diffusion models based on a face identity scorer, without the need for additional modules or architectural modifications. By backpropagating the reward signal and incorporating a facial scoring mechanism, the model achieves improved performance and convergence speed. Furthermore, a KL-divergence regularization is introduced to enhance training stability and prevent overfitting. Experimental results on existing I2V models validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our project and code are available at https://ipro-alimama.github.io/.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95, significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of industrial AI systems.

<div> ViTs, contrastive learning, 3D shape features, representation learning, supervised and self-supervised learning <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper investigates the challenges of learning 3D shape features using state-of-the-art backbones and contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Traditional computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and CNNs that may overlook important shape relationships. The study shows that using Vision Transformers (ViTs) with modern contrastive objectives achieves promising results in multi-view 3D analysis, with supervised contrastive losses reaching 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. By combining ViTs' ability to capture global shape semantics with contrastive learning's effectiveness in refining local features, the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs can be overcome. The approach is validated through extensive experimental evaluation, demonstrating the efficacy of ViTs paired with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines. For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness, overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

<br />
Summary: FutrTrack is a new modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that enhances existing 3D detectors by introducing transformer-based smoother and fusion-driven tracker components. It utilizes a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline, integrating bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR. FutrTrack employs a fusion tracker that assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. A temporal smoother refines sequences of bounding boxes, improving trajectories, reducing jitter, and enhancing spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI datasets, FutrTrack achieves a strong performance with an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, demonstrating the benefits of query-based transformer tracking methods utilizing multimodal sensor features. This approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based tracking in 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy even without pretraining or extensive data. <div>

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.

Summary: 
Deep learning models like convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in medical image classification. However, these models often make overly confident predictions, which can be problematic in critical healthcare scenarios. Traditional label smoothing methods do not consider class relationships adequately. In this study, researchers explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels based on the model's predictions during training. Evaluation on the RadImageNet dataset using popular architectures like ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 shows that OLS consistently improves accuracy compared to standard methods. OLS also enhances representation learning by creating more compact and well-separated feature embeddings. These results indicate that OLS not only boosts predictive performance but also improves calibration, making it a valuable tool for building reliable AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the medical imaging domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point. However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors, particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to fisheye imagery.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a real-time render-aware filtering method to address visual noise in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models when viewed from camera positions outside the training data distribution. By utilizing sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients and targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations, the filtering method improves visual quality, realism, and consistency in 3D reconstruction systems. Compared to existing approaches like BayesRays, the proposed method effectively reduces generative uncertainty and maintains high visual fidelity even outside original training viewpoints. Crucially, the filter seamlessly integrates into 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, negating the need for extensive post-hoc retraining. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in visual quality, making the proposed method a valuable addition to enhance the performance of 3D reconstruction systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain. Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging.

Summary: 
1. The study examines cultural bias in generative image models, focusing on both text-to-image and image-to-image systems.
2. A standardized evaluation framework is used to compare models across six countries, utilizing an 8-category/36-subcategory schema and era-aware prompts.
3. The research reveals that models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts, flattening cross-country distinctions.
4. Iterative image-to-image editing processes can erode cultural fidelity, despite conventional metrics showing no significant changes.
5. Image-to-image models tend to apply superficial cues rather than making era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets.
6. The release of standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols provides a reproducible benchmark for tracking cultural bias in generative image models.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I) systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics, a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1) under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve; and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props) rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

<div> Filter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction, intensity image, moving event camera, FIBAR method, neural networks <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper presents the Filter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction (FIBAR) method for reconstructing intensity images from moving event cameras. FIBAR uses a digital IIR filter to integrate intensity changes signaled by events and a novel algorithm to detect stale pixels and reduce reconstruction noise. Stale pixels are blurred with a Gaussian filter based on the assumption that the absence of events at a pixel location indicates a low image gradient. Unlike traditional methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and allows image read-out at any time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at a high event rate with or without spatial filtering enabled. While FIBAR's reconstruction may be noisier and suffer from ghost images compared to neural network-based methods, it is adequate for specific tasks like detecting fiducial markers. The paper provides code for the FIBAR method on GitHub for reference. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection of fiducial markers.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features. Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5), with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10). Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001), and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

<title>Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency</title>

<div> Keywords: Self-attention, Convolution, Adaptive routing, Lateral inhibition, Attentive Convolution

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper explores the differences between self-attention (SA) and convolution in neural networks, highlighting two key insights. Firstly, SA dynamically regulates information flow based on content, while convolution uses static kernels. Secondly, SA induces competition among token weights, reducing redundancy and enhancing representations, a feature lacking in convolutional filters. Based on these insights, the authors propose Attentive Convolution (ATConv), a reformulation of convolution that incorporates these principles. Remarkably, with only 3x3 kernels, ATConv consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. Introducing AttNet, a CNN family based on ATConv, achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with just 27M parameters. In image generation tasks, replacing SA with ATConv in SiT-XL/2 leads to a reduction in ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster sampling. The code for implementation is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2510.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications. Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research (e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}: SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions. (2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations, whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv), a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks. Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain \textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times 3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster sampling.

<div> diffusion models, hand-drawn sketches, generative models, variational autoencoder, reinforcement learning

Summary: 
StableSketcher is introduced as a framework for generating high-quality hand-drawn sketches using diffusion models. By fine-tuning the variational autoencoder and incorporating a new reward function based on visual question answering, the framework enhances the fidelity and alignment of generated sketches with prompts. StableSketcher outperforms the Stable Diffusion baseline in terms of stylistic fidelity and prompt alignment. The newly created dataset SketchDUO includes instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, addressing limitations of existing datasets that only have image-label pairs. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StableSketcher in generating sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and semantic consistency. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<div> supervision, biological multimodal foundation models, captions, species classification, text-image retrieval<br />
Summary: This work explores the use of descriptive captions as additional supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Captions and images are seen as complementary representations of a species, with captions capturing specific biological traits. By incorporating captions during training, the model can align with a shared latent structure and focus on relevant biological characteristics while eliminating irrelevant correlations. One of the main challenges is obtaining accurate, instance-specific captions at scale. To address this, synthetic captions are generated using multimodal large language models, guided by visual information from Wikipedia and taxon-specific examples. These descriptions help reduce errors and improve the accuracy of the captions. The BIOCAP model, trained with these enhanced captions, achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval tasks. This study showcases the value of descriptive captions in enhancing the capabilities of biological multimodal foundation models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP (i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.

<div> Keywords: light fields, view synthesis, image-based rendering, neural rendering, novel view synthesis

Summary:
Light-field technology, which involves computing light fields from multiple view images on regular grids, has been beneficial for realistic scene representations and renderings. This paper introduces a new method called inverse image-based rendering to generate light fields from single images. Unlike previous approaches that reconstruct 3D geometry, the proposed method focuses on reconstructing light flows in a space from image pixels. A neural rendering pipeline is designed to achieve this, storing light flow information from source rays, computing relationships through cross-attention, and predicting target ray colors. The pipeline iteratively generates novel views from a single image, updating out-of-view contents and ensuring consistent generation of occluded contents. The method performs well on challenging datasets without the need for retraining, outperforming existing novel view synthesis techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships. After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<div> LogitGap, OOD detection, deep learning, logits space, post-hoc method
Summary:<br /><br />LogitGap is a new method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep learning models. It leverages the relationship between the maximum logit and other logits to improve the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. By focusing on a more informative subset of the logit space, LogitGap automatically identifies the most relevant logits for scoring without requiring training. The approach has been validated theoretically and empirically, showing superior performance compared to existing methods across various OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code for LogitGap is available on GitHub, making it accessible for further research and application in open-world deep learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space. Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

The article introduces PartNeXt, a dataset of over 23,000 textured 3D models with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. It addresses limitations of previous datasets by offering high-quality, textured models and expert-independent annotation. PartNeXt is benchmarked on class-agnostic part segmentation, where existing methods struggle with fine-grained parts, and 3D part-centric question answering, revealing gaps in part grounding.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering, a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity. By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D understanding.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous Driving, Vulnerable Road Users, Pose Estimation, 8D Pose, Articulated Bicycles

Summary:
In the field of Autonomous Driving, accurately estimating the pose of cyclists is crucial for safety. This study focuses on developing a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles have movable parts linked by joints, making their pose estimation more complex. The proposed method not only estimates the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle but also the rotations of its steering handles and pedals relative to the bicycle body frame. By incorporating these additional parameters, a more detailed pose state and travel direction of the bicycle can be determined. The model is trained using a combination of synthetic and real image data, showing promising results in accurately estimating the 8D pose parameters of articulated bicycles. Additionally, the method achieves competitive scores when compared to state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure. 6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles, but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Summary: 
The proposed approach in this paper addresses the challenge of distribution shift in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by updating multimodal prototypes using textual and visual knowledge from unsupervised data at test time. An adaptive update weight is introduced to facilitate flexible prototype adjustment during testing, while a dynamic priority queue is utilized to store high-confidence images for acquiring visual knowledge from historical data. Through multimodal collaborative representation learning, textual and visual prototypes are aligned to ensure semantic consistency.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Summary: 
The new IB-GAN model integrates the Information Bottleneck framework into GAN optimization for disentangled representation learning. Similar to InfoGAN, IB-GAN uses an intermediate layer in the generator to constrain mutual information between input and output, enabling the generator to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent space. Experimental results on dSprites and Color-dSprites datasets show that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores compared to state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Additionally, IB-GAN generates visually better and more diverse samples than \b{eta}-VAEs and InfoGAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of IB-GAN for unsupervised disentangled representation learning.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost. To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a `play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN) for Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) in video surveillance. SPAN employs continuous regression to capture the evolving nature of suspicious intentions, outperforming existing discrete classification methods. By modeling suspicion as a continuous variable with long-term dependencies, SPAN improves detection accuracy and reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 19.8% while increasing average mAP by 1.78%. The Suspicion Coefficient Modulation adjusts suspicion coefficients using multimodal information, enhancing the system's ability to detect subtle behavioral changes. The Concept-Anchored Mapping method links suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into underlying intentions. SPAN's continuous suspicion modeling allows for earlier detection and proactive intervention, improving system explainability and practical utility in security applications. It achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating its superior performance in capturing subtle changes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance, focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions. Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%. Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Summary:  
- The study analyzes 54 publicly available brain MRI datasets to evaluate the scale, diversity, and consistency of data for foundation model development.
- Imbalances exist between healthy and clinical populations in dataset composition.
- Heterogeneity across datasets in voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions can impact representation learning.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction, skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

<div> Keyword: prompt design, text-to-video generation, cross-stage prompt optimization, semantic alignment, compositional reasoning <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces RAPO++, a framework designed to optimize prompts for text-to-video generation. RAPO++ consists of three stages: Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with relevant modifiers, Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO) iteratively refines prompts for improved video generation quality, and fine-tuning the rewriter LLM using optimized prompt pairs. The framework aims to improve semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility in T2V models. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models and benchmarks, RAPO++ outperforms existing methods significantly. It is a cost-efficient, model-agnostic, and scalable solution for prompt optimization in T2V generation. The code for RAPO++ is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Vchitect/RAPO. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models. We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1}, Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++ achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation.

<div> FlowCycle, text-to-image, image editing, corruption-then-restoration paradigm, target-aware intermediate state<br />
Summary:<br />
FlowCycle is a new text-to-image editing framework that aims to enhance the editability and consistency of image editing processes. It introduces a target-aware intermediate state concept, which selectively corrupts editing-relevant contents while preserving editing-irrelevant ones. By using learnable noises to parameterize corruption and optimizing them through a cycle-consistent process, FlowCycle achieves faithful modifications while maintaining source consistency. This inversion-free and flow-based editing approach outperforms current methods by producing superior editing quality and consistency. The proposed framework has been extensively evaluated through ablations, demonstrating its effectiveness in text-based image editing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: CURL is proposed for accurate fetal movement detection from ultrasound videos, addressing challenges of traditional methods like subjectivity and accuracy. It uses dual-contrastive loss for robust motion representations and a task-specific sampling strategy for effective training. CURL achieves 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on a dataset of 92 subjects with 30-minute sessions, showing promise for objective FM analysis.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy, ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions, CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis, paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

<div> Keywords: diffusion-based generative models, text-driven image editing, VQ-based generative models, image inversion, EditInfinity.

Summary: 
EditInfinity proposes an adaptation of Infinity, a binary-quantized generative model, for text-driven image editing. The approach focuses on efficient and effective image inversion, integrating text prompting rectification and image style preservation for precise inversion. A holistic smoothing strategy enables high-fidelity image editing with precise alignment to text prompts. The method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines on the PIE-Bench benchmark, across "add," "change," and "delete" editing operations. The approach leverages the exact intermediate quantized representations of source images in VQ-based generative models to provide more effective supervision for precise image inversion. EditInfinity demonstrates superior performance in image editing tasks, showcasing the potential of adapting VQ-based models for text-driven image editing scenarios. The code is available on GitHub for implementation and further research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential. A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose \emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

<title>Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context</title>

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, hallucination, context, coherence, mitigation <br />
Summary: 
In this paper, the authors investigate the phenomenon of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and explore the underlying mechanisms that contribute to this issue. They propose a novel framework called "induce-detect-suppress" to actively induce hallucinations in controlled contexts, detect high-risk cases early, and suppress potential hallucinations during decoding. Through their experiments, they affirm that hallucinations in LVLMs are not solely caused by the length of responses but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness. The proposed framework shows consistent and significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations. This study not only advances the understanding of hallucinations in LVLMs but also highlights the importance of context in generating coherent and accurate responses. <div>
arXiv:2510.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<div> Keywords: 3D segmentation, language collaboration, instance field, segmentation cues, prompt-segmentation framework

Summary:
COS3D introduces a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, addressing limitations in existing methods. The framework incorporates a collaborative field consisting of an instance field and a language field, enhancing the integration of segmentation and language cues. A novel instance-to-language feature mapping captures the relationship between the fields, improving the training process. An adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement is designed for efficient inference, promoting high-quality segmentation results. COS3D demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks and shows promise in applications like image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics. The code for COS3D is publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However, existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations, we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship between the instance field and language field, through a novel instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

<div> keywords: Video Temporal Grounding, Moment Retrieval, Highlight Detection, CLIP, DualGround 

Summary:
DualGround addresses the limitations of existing Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) models by introducing a dual-branch architecture that separates global and local semantics. By routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units, the model can effectively utilize word-level signals for fine-grained temporal alignment. Token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies ensure alignment of video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally disentangled manner. A joint modeling framework enhances global sentence-level alignment and fine-grained temporal grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. These design choices allow DualGround to capture both coarse and localized semantics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long, untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces (1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

<div> Keywords: Cross-view object geo-localization, mask-based positional encoding, object-aware modeling, context enhancement module, satellite imagery

Summary: 
EDGeo introduces a novel mask-based positional encoding (MPE) scheme that combines spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, enhancing cross-view object localization. By leveraging segmentation masks, the model becomes more "object-aware," improving matching capabilities. Additionally, a context enhancement module (CEM) is designed to address the challenges of large-span objects in satellite imagery by extracting long-range contextual features. Integration of MPE and CEM results in the EDGeo framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks. Experiments on public datasets show a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy, especially in challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work contributes a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework for advancing research in cross-view geo-localization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving, urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware." Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Summary:
The article introduces a model called Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC) to address challenges in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER). The model leverages a Pseudo Label Generation Module to enable unimodal pretraining and a Parameter-free Fusion Module for multimodal finetuning. Additionally, a Multimodal Consensus Router guides the fusion process towards a more reliable consensus, mitigating text dominance in the recognition process.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity, which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels, enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, GMFVAD, for video anomaly detection that leverages multi-modal information to enhance feature extraction and reduce redundancy. By generating grained multi-modal features based on video snippets and incorporating text features from captions, GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. The refinement of features through the diversity among multi-modal information helps in better identifying anomalies in surveillance videos. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of GMFVAD in reducing redundant information and improving anomaly detection accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets, comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across different datasets.

Summary:
The article introduces the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN) for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR) image recognition. KINN addresses the trilemma of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency by utilizing electromagnetic scattering features through a compression-aggregation-compression architecture. The framework includes a physics-guided compression stage, an aggregation module, and a semantic compression stage with self-distillation. KINN is implemented in both CNN and Vision Transformer variants with a low parameter count. Evaluation on five SAR benchmarks shows that KINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in parameter-efficient recognition, excelling in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios. It offers high generalization, interpretability, and effectiveness in overcoming the representation trilemma, paving the way for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR) image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting, optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition, offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework for Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) to address challenges in first-person video understanding. The framework includes a baseline model, a module for generating counterfactual samples, and a contrastive optimization module. Counterfactual samples are created for textual and visual modalities to improve event understanding and hand-object interaction recognition. By incorporating these samples into the baseline and employing contrastive optimization, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple dataset splits, EgoTaskQA, and QAEGO4D. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in enhancing egocentric videoqa tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

<div> Keywords: Multi-modal large language models, visual-textual alignment, hyperbolic space, hierarchical levels, efficient training

Summary: 
Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized the alignment of visual and textual understanding. However, their high computational resource demands stem from vision encoders like CLIP and SAM lacking cross-modal alignment at various granularity levels. To address this, a novel approach leveraging hyperbolic space is proposed. The HyperET training paradigm optimizes visual representations to align with text counterparts at any granularity level by dynamically adjusting hyperbolic radius. Utilizing learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication in three configurations - diagonal scaling, block-diagonal, and banded matrices, HyperET efficiently bridges the granularity gap while maintaining flexibility. Extensive experiments across MLLM benchmarks showcase consistent improvements in both pre-training and fine-tuning, with minimal additional parameters. This approach offers a principled and efficient solution for enhancing visual-textual alignment in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\% additional parameters.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AccuQuant, a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models. It addresses the issue of error accumulation in quantization errors for diffusion models over denoising steps in a sampling process. AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion model outputs, simulating multiple denoising steps explicitly to account for accumulated errors. Unlike previous approaches, which minimize discrepancies independently for each step, AccuQuant considers the error accumulation problem. The method also includes an efficient implementation technique and a novel objective that significantly reduces memory complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method, dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps. That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks.

Summary:
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are leading in visual generation models, with images represented as patch tokens and positional encodings (PEs). Patch tokens show a surprising independence, leading to globally coherent outputs even with perturbed PEs. This indicates that spatial coherence is mostly influenced by PEs. The Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) extends PEs to a 3D field, incorporating depth-aware and hierarchical encodings for volumetric reasoning and fine-grained control over sub-patches. This augmentation allows DiTs to directly model geometry in 3D space. The PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves top performance in single-image novel view synthesis and enables controllable spatial image editing. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel causal approach to improve image-to-recipe retrieval by addressing the limitations of existing methods that fail to capture subtle recipe-specific details. By predicting overlooked culinary elements in images and incorporating them into cross-modal representation learning, biases in dominant visual elements can be mitigated. The proposed approach is tested on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural cuisine datasets, showing impressive retrieval performance. The results suggest that this causal representation learning method is effective in uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions, leading to a more accurate and nuanced understanding of recipes in different cuisines. <div>
arXiv:2510.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.

Computational efficiency is addressed by using Genetic Algorithm to select the most suitable pre-trained student model.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights, our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic, enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model, which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet, enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000 histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images (99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

arXiv:2510.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of reliable demographic attribute inference (DAI) in evaluating the fairness of face analysis systems (FAS). The reliability of DAI impacts the accuracy and fairness of FAS assessments. A modular transfer learning approach is proposed to improve DAI reliability, combining pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. The method is evaluated on accuracy, fairness, and robustness, with a focus on ethnicity, a challenging attribute. Results show superior performance compared to strong baselines. The proposed robustness metric, measuring intra-identity consistency, is a valuable addition to fairness auditing. The research aims to enhance transparency and reproducibility by publicly releasing training dataset metadata, codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation tools. This work establishes a dependable framework for demographic inference in FAS fairness auditing.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness. To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy, fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

<title>EchoDistill: Bidirectional Concept Distillation for One-Step Diffusion Personalization</title>

arXiv:2510.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However, personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP). Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output. Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy, wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

<title>Metis-HOME: Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress, current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries, leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR. A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

arXiv:2510.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context (Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation. Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks, FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D, ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of 87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

<title>From Cheap to Pro: A Learning-based Adaptive Camera Parameter Network for Professional-Style Imaging</title>

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range, and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color, which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.

<title>Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20579</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.

<title>GenColorBench: A Color Evaluation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

arXiv:2510.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation. The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

arXiv:2510.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift, unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging, particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

<title>SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs) can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs.

<title>Deep Learning in Dental Image Analysis: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Methodologies, and Emerging Challenges</title>

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260 studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

arXiv:2510.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/UltraHR-100k}{here}.

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization. Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation, inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map (Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps, improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset, HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations, the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities, circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

<title>Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20673</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model. However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/EMQNet_jk.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

<title>ALICE-LRI: A General Method for Lossless Range Image Generation for Spinning LiDAR Sensors without Calibration Metadata</title>

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general, sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits, demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e., rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and 43.0\%, respectively.

Abstract: Automated histopathological image analysis plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis of various diseases. Among developed algorithms, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple tasks, including semantic tissue segmentation in histological images. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on attention-driven feature fusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) within a unified dual-encoder model to improve semantic segmentation performance. Evaluation on two publicly available datasets showed that our model achieved {\mu}IoU/{\mu}Dice scores of 76.79%/86.87% on the GCPS dataset and 64.93%/76.60% on the PUMA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art and baseline benchmarks.

<title>DyPE: Dynamic Position Extrapolation for Ultra High Resolution Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve. Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space, Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery; and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3 dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

arXiv:2510.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.

arXiv:2510.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

<title>SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects. Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images (HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against supervised baselines.

<title>Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive Latent Diffusion Bridge</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

arXiv:2510.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation. Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence, HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at: https://holo-cine.github.io/.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces. The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods, its failure modes, and other limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92% precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy, offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26 participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived, including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations, particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing research and improving resistance training prescription.

<title>Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations -- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure, independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems have traditionally relied on structured text data, but the rapid growth of multimedia content (images, audio, video, and structured metadata) has introduced new challenges and opportunities for retrieval-augmented QA. In this survey, we review recent advancements in QA systems that integrate multimedia retrieval pipelines, focusing on architectures that align vision, language, and audio modalities with user queries. We categorize approaches based on retrieval methods, fusion techniques, and answer generation strategies, and analyze benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and performance tradeoffs. Furthermore, we highlight key challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia data.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent, capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way, compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav". We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image. While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning (GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E) approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.

<title>MEIcoder: Decoding Visual Stimuli from Neural Activity by Leveraging Most Exciting Inputs</title>

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces. However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging, remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

<title>Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples</title>

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over 10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1) learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Due to their high temporal resolution and large dynamic range, event cameras are uniquely suited for the analysis of time-periodic signals in an image. In this work we present an efficient and fully asynchronous event camera algorithm for detecting the fundamental frequency at which image pixels flicker. The algorithm employs a second-order digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to perform an approximate per-pixel brightness reconstruction and is more robust to high-frequency noise than the baseline method we compare to. We further demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more accurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals interpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy. Our experiments find that the outstanding capabilities of the camera in detecting frequencies up to 64kHz for a single pixel do not carry over to full sensor imaging as readout bandwidth limitations become a serious obstacle. This suggests that a hardware implementation closer to the sensor will allow for greatly improved frequency imaging. We discuss the important design parameters for fullsensor frequency imaging and present Frequency Cam, an open-source implementation as a ROS node that can run on a single core of a laptop CPU at more than 50 million events per second. It produces results that are qualitatively very similar to those obtained from the closed source vibration analysis module in Prophesee's Metavision Toolkit.

Abstract: Deepfakes, which employ GAN to produce highly realistic facial modification, are widely regarded as the prevailing method. Traditional CNN have been able to identify bogus media, but they struggle to perform well on different datasets and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their lack of robustness. Vision transformers have demonstrated potential in the realm of image classification problems, but they require enough training data. Motivated by these limitations, this publication introduces Tex-ViT (Texture-Vision Transformer), which enhances CNN features by combining ResNet with a vision transformer. The model combines traditional ResNet features with a texture module that operates in parallel on sections of ResNet before each down-sampling operation. The texture module then serves as an input to the dual branch of the cross-attention vision transformer. It specifically focuses on improving the global texture module, which extracts feature map correlation. Empirical analysis reveals that fake images exhibit smooth textures that do not remain consistent over long distances in manipulations. Experiments were performed on different categories of FF++, such as DF, f2f, FS, and NT, together with other types of GAN datasets in cross-domain scenarios. Furthermore, experiments also conducted on FF++, DFDCPreview, and Celeb-DF dataset underwent several post-processing situations, such as blurring, compression, and noise. The model surpassed the most advanced models in terms of generalization, achieving a 98% accuracy in cross-domain scenarios. This demonstrates its ability to learn the shared distinguishing textural characteristics in the manipulated samples. These experiments provide evidence that the proposed model is capable of being applied to various situations and is resistant to many post-processing procedures.

Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be difficult to optimize and costly to train due to hundreds of layers within the network depth. Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench includes a development set and a test set, each with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. We also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models. The dataset and evaluation code have been made publicly available at https://face-human-bench.github.io.

Abstract: We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, e.g., non-physical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos, where 3D information is essential for perceiving shape and motion of interacting solids. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing video diffusion models to improve their visual plausibility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.

Abstract: Automated livestock monitoring is crucial for precision farming, but robust computer vision models are hindered by a lack of datasets reflecting real-world group challenges. We introduce the 8-Calves dataset, a challenging benchmark for multi-animal detection, tracking, and identification. It features a one-hour video of eight Holstein Friesian calves in a barn, with frequent occlusions, motion blur, and diverse poses. A semi-automated pipeline using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 detector and ByteTrack, followed by manual correction, provides over 537,000 bounding boxes with temporal identity labels.
  We benchmark 28 object detectors, showing near-perfect performance on a lenient IoU threshold (mAP50: 95.2-98.9%) but significant divergence on stricter metrics (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), highlighting fine-grained localization challenges. Our identification benchmark across 23 models reveals a trade-off: scaling model size improves classification accuracy but compromises retrieval. Smaller architectures like ConvNextV2 Nano achieve the best balance (73.35% accuracy, 50.82% Top-1 KNN). Pre-training focused on semantic learning (e.g., BEiT) yielded superior transferability. For tracking, leading methods achieve high detection accuracy (MOTA > 0.92) but struggle with identity preservation (IDF1 $\approx$ 0.27), underscoring a key challenge in occlusion-heavy scenarios.
  The 8-Calves dataset bridges a gap by providing temporal richness and realistic challenges, serving as a resource for advancing agricultural vision models. The dataset and code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tonyFang04/8-calves.

Abstract: Modern image restoration and super-resolution methods utilize deep learning due to its superior performance compared to traditional algorithms. However, deep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely available in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint by performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some cases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and instability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this work proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame training using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow estimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with unbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image reconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based model DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior reconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than Lucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation. Evaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically hinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction quality, confirming practical robustness.

Abstract: The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare demands robust mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of these systems, especially when faced with unexpected or anomalous inputs. This paper introduces the Open Medical Imaging Benchmarks for Out-Of-Distribution Detection (OpenMIBOOD), a comprehensive framework for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods specifically in medical imaging contexts. OpenMIBOOD includes three benchmarks from diverse medical domains, encompassing 14 datasets divided into covariate-shifted in-distribution, near-OOD, and far-OOD categories. We evaluate 24 post-hoc methods across these benchmarks, providing a standardized reference to advance the development and fair comparison of OOD detection methods.

Abstract: Existing autonomous driving datasets are predominantly oriented towards well-structured urban settings and favourable weather conditions, leaving the complexities of rural environments and adverse weather conditions largely unaddressed. Although some datasets encompass variations in weather and lighting, bad weather scenarios do not appear often. Rainfall can significantly impair sensor functionality, introducing noise and reflections in LiDAR and camera data and reducing the system's capabilities for reliable environmental perception and safe navigation. This paper introduces the Panoptic-CUDAL dataset, a novel dataset purpose-built for panoptic segmentation in rural areas subject to rain. By recording high-resolution LiDAR, camera, and pose data, Panoptic-CUDAL offers a diverse, information-rich dataset in a challenging scenario. We present the analysis of the recorded data and provide baseline results for panoptic, semantic segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction methods on LiDAR point clouds.

Abstract: Current image fusion methods struggle to address the composite degradations encountered in real-world imaging scenarios and lack the flexibility to accommodate user-specific requirements. In response to these challenges, we propose a controllable image fusion framework with language-vision prompts, termed ControlFusion, which adaptively neutralizes composite degradations. On the one hand, we develop a degraded imaging model that integrates physical imaging mechanisms, including the Retinex theory and atmospheric scattering principle, to simulate composite degradations, thereby providing potential for addressing real-world complex degradations from the data level. On the other hand, we devise a prompt-modulated restoration and fusion network that dynamically enhances features with degradation prompts, enabling our method to accommodate composite degradation of varying levels. Specifically, considering individual variations in quality perception of users, we incorporate a text encoder to embed user-specified degradation types and severity levels as degradation prompts. We also design a spatial-frequency collaborative visual adapter that autonomously perceives degradations in source images, thus eliminating the complete dependence on user instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ControlFusion outperforms SOTA fusion methods in fusion quality and degradation handling, particularly in countering real-world and compound degradations with various levels.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel scenes that faithfully preserve subject identity from reference images while adhering to textual guidance. However, existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive, subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods often fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor leverages semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated images. Additionally, our framework introduces a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve the geometry priors of reference subjects, facilitating robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nihukat/FreeGraftor.

Abstract: Hands are essential to human interaction, and exploring contact between hands and the world can promote comprehensive understanding of their function. Recently, there have been growing number of hand interaction datasets that cover interaction with object, other hand, scene, and body. Despite the significance of the task and increasing high-quality data, how to effectively learn dense hand contact estimation remains largely underexplored. There are two major challenges for learning dense hand contact estimation. First, there exists class imbalance issue from hand contact datasets where majority of regions are not in contact. Second, hand contact datasets contain spatial imbalance issue with most of hand contact exhibited in finger tips, resulting in challenges for generalization towards contacts in other hand regions. To tackle these issues, we present a framework that learns dense HAnd COntact estimation (HACO) from imbalanced data. To resolve the class imbalance issue, we introduce balanced contact sampling, which builds and samples from multiple sampling groups that fairly represent diverse contact statistics for both contact and non-contact vertices. Moreover, to address the spatial imbalance issue, we propose vertex-level class-balanced (VCB) loss, which incorporates spatially varying contact distribution by separately reweighting loss contribution of each vertex based on its contact frequency across dataset. As a result, we effectively learn to predict dense hand contact estimation with large-scale hand contact data without suffering from class and spatial imbalance issue. The codes are available at https://github.com/dqj5182/HACO_RELEASE.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by contrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of the modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place optimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity. Moreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To address these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\Delta_{ij}$ between text $t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension and absorb noise. We derive $\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor expansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it guides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches for structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\Delta$ through a variational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing stability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation. Code is available at https://github.com/musicman217/GARE-text-video-retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have gained widespread application across various domains, demonstrating remarkable creative potential. However, the strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and development in this critical area.

Abstract: Existing pretrained models for 3D mesh generation often suffer from data biases and produce low-quality results, while global reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on object-level rewards that struggle to capture local structure details. To address these challenges, we present Mesh-RFT, a novel fine-grained reinforcement fine-tuning framework that employs Masked Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable localized refinement via quality-aware face masking. To facilitate efficient quality evaluation, we introduce an objective topology-aware scoring system to evaluate geometric integrity and topological regularity at both object and face levels through two metrics: Boundary Edge Ratio (BER) and Topology Score (TS). By integrating these metrics into a fine-grained RL strategy, Mesh-RFT becomes the first method to optimize mesh quality at the granularity of individual faces, resolving localized errors while preserving global coherence. Experiment results show that our M-DPO approach reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 24.6% and improves Topology Score (TS) by 3.8% over pre-trained models, while outperforming global DPO methods with a 17.4% HD reduction and 4.9% TS gain. These results demonstrate Mesh-RFT's ability to improve geometric integrity and topological regularity, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in production-ready mesh generation.

Abstract: Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/lx709/REOBench.

<title>MODEM: A Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism for Adverse Weather Image Recovery</title>

Abstract: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP!

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output (local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning (BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average. Our code is available at https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/NeurIPS2025-Balanced-Token-Pruning.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic $\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM) that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, and consistently improves performance across various SR architectures. Notably, for the x4 SR task on UCMerced dataset, it attained a PSNR of 29.3042 dB and an SSIM of 0.7961.

Abstract: Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters, offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoYu-1123/PreFM.

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is https://github.com/DearCaat/E2E-WSI-ABMILX.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits. Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex species. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant species, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDAM.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/Elman295/TCSSM.

<title>ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising 22 generative models. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/xigua7105/FerretNet.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body PET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, especially for low-resource languages and clinical use in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements, particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73 to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc, achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels, avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71 mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a major obstacle to model generalization. To address this challenge from a data-centric perspective, this paper introduces a profile extraction and discovery framework for characterizing the style profiles underlying both synthetic and real image datasets. We propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized profiling-based quality control paradigm that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users. Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation (3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method, i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Vector databases typically manage large collections of embedding vectors. Currently, AI applications are growing rapidly, and so is the number of embeddings that need to be stored and indexed. The Faiss library is dedicated to vector similarity search, a core functionality of vector databases. Faiss is a toolkit of indexing methods and related primitives used to search, cluster, compress and transform vectors. This paper describes the trade-off space of vector search and the design principles of Faiss in terms of structure, approach to optimization and interfacing. We benchmark key features of the library and discuss a few selected applications to highlight its broad applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we identify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and recommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal prompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also introduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image content using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone, achieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive performance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.

Abstract: We address the optimization problem in a data-driven variational reconstruction framework, where the regularizer is parameterized by an input-convex neural network (ICNN). While gradient-based methods are commonly used to solve such problems, they struggle to effectively handle non-smooth problems which often leads to slow convergence. Moreover, the nested structure of the neural network complicates the application of standard non-smooth optimization techniques, such as proximal algorithms. To overcome these challenges, we reformulate the problem and eliminate the network's nested structure. By relating this reformulation to epigraphical projections of the activation functions, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a primal-dual algorithm. We also prove that this reformulation is equivalent to the original variational problem. Through experiments on several imaging tasks, we show that the proposed approach not only outperforms subgradient methods and even accelerated methods in the smooth setting, but also facilitates the training of the regularizer itself.

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end, determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish, rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

<title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: When applying reinforcement learning--typically through GRPO--to large vision-language model reasoning struggles to effectively scale reasoning length or generates verbose outputs across all tasks with only marginal gains in accuracy. To address this issue, we present FAST-GRPO, a variant of GRPO that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics. Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. Inspired by these observations, we introduce two complementary metrics to estimate the difficulty of the questions, guiding the model to determine when fast or slow thinking is more appropriate. Next, we incorporate adaptive length-based rewards and difficulty-aware KL divergence into the GRPO algorithm. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values. Code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/wmar.

Abstract: Segmenting cytoskeletal filaments in microscopy images is essential for understanding their cellular roles but remains challenging, especially in dense, complex networks and under noisy or low-contrast image conditions. While deep learning has advanced image segmentation, performance often degrades in these adverse scenarios. Additional challenges include the difficulty of obtaining accurate annotations and managing severe class imbalance. We proposed a novel noise-adaptive attention mechanism, extending the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module, to dynamically adjust to varying noise levels. This Adaptive SE (ASE) mechanism is integrated into a U-Net decoder, with residual encoder blocks, forming a lightweight yet powerful model: ASE_Res_U-Net. We also developed a synthetic-dataset strategy and employed tailored loss functions and evaluation metrics to mitigate class imbalance and ensure fair assessment. ASE_Res_U-Net effectively segmented microtubules in both synthetic and real noisy images, outperforming its ablated variants and state-of-the-art curvilinear-structure segmentation methods. It achieved this while using fewer parameters, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Importantly, ASE_Res_U-Net generalised well to other curvilinear structures (blood vessels and nerves) under diverse imaging conditions. Availability and implementation: Original microtubule datasets (synthetic and real noisy images) are available on Zenodo (DOIs: 10.5281/zenodo.14696279 and 10.5281/zenodo.15852660). ASE_Res_UNet model will be shared upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference. Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8%/81.7% on the clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5 ms inference latency and 1.7,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6%/98.6% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

Summary: 
Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) face challenges due to evaluator bias and homogeneity in models. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that decomposes the risk concept space into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces. RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework, utilizes multi-round debate mechanisms and dynamic updates to enhance risk evaluation accuracy and reduce bias. Validation on a dataset of 800 challenging cases shows that RADAR outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, stability, and risk sensitivity. Specifically, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline method. <div>

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction.

<div> Neural Fiducial Markers, Ninja Codes, Encoder Network, Location Tracking, Augmented Reality<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces Ninja Codes, which are neural-generated fiducial markers designed to seamlessly blend into real-world environments. An encoder network is utilized to convert arbitrary images into Ninja Codes through subtle visual alterations. These codes can be printed on regular paper using color printers and utilized for stealthy 6-DoF location tracking in various applications such as augmented reality and robotics. Ninja Codes are detectable using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera capable of running inference. Through an end-to-end process inspired by deep steganography, a series of network modules are jointly trained for Ninja Codes creation and detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Ninja Codes in providing reliable tracking under typical indoor lighting conditions while effectively concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures. This innovation is particularly valuable in scenarios where conventional fiducial markers' conspicuous appearances are unsuitable for aesthetic and practical reasons. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

Summary: 
The article introduces a two-phase vision-language question-answering system for autonomous driving tasks, focusing on perception, prediction, and planning. In Phase-1, a large multimodal Language-Modeling Model (LLM) is utilized with input from six cameras, historical data, and specific prompts. The system further improves answer reliability through self-consistency ensembles. In Phase-2, the system incorporates nuScenes scene metadata and category-specific question instructions for different driving tasks. Experimental results on a driving QA benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline models, with the system achieving high accuracy even under severe visual corruption. Using carefully designed prompts and contextual grounding, the system showcases the potential of pretrained vision-language models in enhancing high-level driving QA tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

Summary: 
The article introduces Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture designed for longitudinal medical imaging analysis. It effectively captures the spatial and temporal information present in high-resolution radiological images captured at irregular time intervals. The model incorporates a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that considers the true time difference between exams, and a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module to capture spatio-temporal relationships. In a breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammograms, the model outperforms established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. It improves the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieves higher 1-5 year AUC scores.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

<div> Keywords: text-to-video diffusion models, motion-centric alignment, disentangled motion subspace, optical flow prediction, video synthesis

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by text-to-video diffusion models in generating temporally coherent and physically plausible motion in synthesized videos. The authors propose a motion-centric alignment framework that leverages a disentangled motion subspace learned from a pretrained video encoder to improve the motion synthesis capabilities of the generative model. By aligning the latent features of the diffusion model with this new subspace optimized for predicting ground-truth optical flow, the model gains a better understanding of true motion dynamics. Empirical evaluations on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the physical commonsense in video synthesis while maintaining fidelity to textual prompts. The framework's effectiveness is validated through experiments on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0, as well as a user study.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However, these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features, limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

<div> image description, vision-language models, evaluation, metric, scene graphs

Summary: 
The article introduces a new metric, PoSh, for evaluating detailed image descriptions generated by vision-language models. PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to provide fine-grained error analysis and is shown to outperform existing metrics in replicability and interpretability. A new dataset, DOCENT, is introduced to validate PoSh, containing artwork paired with expert-written references and model-generated descriptions evaluated by art history students. PoSh demonstrates stronger correlations with human judgments in DOCENT and is robust across different image types. The study shows that foundation models struggle to accurately describe images with rich scene dynamics, highlighting the need for further advancements in vision-language models for detailed image description tasks. Overall, PoSh and DOCENT aim to advance assistive text generation and provide a challenging benchmark for evaluating detailed image description models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

Summary: 
The paper introduces UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline that aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D, and 3D human poses. It proposes a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align different modalities, enhancing performance. The aligned representation is evaluated through 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation tasks, yielding impressive results: MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW datasets with cross-domain evaluation. Additionally, UniHPR achieves 9.24mm MPJPE pose retrieval error in 2D and 3D pose retrieval on the Human3.6M dataset. This work addresses the need for effective alignment pipelines for generating unified representations across modalities, particularly focusing on Human Pose representations essential for various applications such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, and Human-Computer Interaction. <div>
arXiv:2510.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias. This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation, ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

Summary:
Deep learning techniques were applied in this study to automatically detect malaria in blood cell images. The conventional method of diagnosing malaria through manual observation of blood cells under a microscope can lead to inaccuracies due to lack of expertise. By utilizing deep convolutional networks such as Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet, the study achieved high accuracy rates of 97.28% and 97.55% respectively on a public dataset. These results outperformed other existing methods for malaria detection. The findings suggest that deep learning-driven approaches offer a feasible and reliable alternative for detecting malaria, reducing the need for manual intervention and potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in the identification of malaria-infected cells. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos, often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5 years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills, and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis. Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute. In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55% respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual involvement.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal large language models, hallucinations, attention allocation, visual tokens, token pruning

Summary:
PruneHal is a novel method proposed to address hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). The method targets the issue of insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens, which leads to the dispersion of the model's focus and the occurrence of hallucinations. By leveraging adaptive KV cache pruning, PruneHal enhances the model's attention towards critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations without the need for additional training or incurring extra inference costs. The approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with various decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. Evaluated on multiple hallucination evaluation benchmarks using mainstream MLLMs, PruneHal demonstrates robust and superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenge of hallucinations in multi-modal language models. The code for PruneHal will be made publicly available.

It leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to mitigate hallucinations without additional training or computational costs. PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be integrated with various decoding strategies for effective hallucination mitigation. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows the superiority of PruneHal in enhancing model focus on critical visual information. The proposed method provides a simple yet effective solution to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

Summary:<br /><br />Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective method to improve video quality without the need for real-world video datasets. However, conventional reward functions may not sufficiently enhance temporal consistency in image-to-video generation tasks. To address this, the novel Video Consistency Distance (VCD) metric is proposed, utilizing frequency-domain analysis to capture frame information and improve temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image. Experiment results on various I2V datasets show that fine-tuning with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency while maintaining other performance aspects. <div>

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework. To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance compared to the previous method.

<div> Keywords: driving world models, synthetic data generation, perception tasks, autonomous driving, multi-view corner cases

Summary: 
Dream4Drive is a new synthetic data generation framework that enhances downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving.

By fine-tuning driving world models with these edited videos, Dream4Drive significantly improves corner case perception at scale. Additionally, the framework includes DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset for diverse 3D-aware video editing. Dream4Drive's approach outperforms existing methods by focusing on downstream perception tasks, unlike conventional methods that overlook this crucial aspect. It demonstrates the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing perception models and bridges the gap between synthetic and real data training strategies. This innovative framework provides unprecedented flexibility in generating and training on multi-view corner cases, ultimately benefiting the performance and safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

<div> Gaussian Splatting, Dynamic Scene Reconstruction, Mixture of Experts, Volume-aware Pixel Router, Efficiency improvement <br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper introduces Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS) as a unified framework for dynamic scene reconstruction. By integrating multiple specialized experts and using a Volume-aware Pixel Router, MoE-GS effectively handles diverse dynamic challenges with spatial and temporal coherence. The approach improves rendering quality but faces challenges of increased model capacity and reduced FPS. To address these issues, the paper explores single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and a distillation strategy. These techniques enhance efficiency within the MoE framework and enable lightweight deployment without architectural changes. MoE-GS outperforms existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction, as shown in experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets. Video demonstrations further illustrate the effectiveness of MoE-GS. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router. Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts, enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/MoE-GS-68BA/.

Summary:
Surface fitting-based SFGFusion network enhances object representation from camera and radar data, improving depth prediction. This depth aids in transforming image features to bird's-eye view for multi-modal fusion and generating a dense pseudo-point cloud to address radar point sparsity. The network utilizes a pillar-based method to encode radar point clouds and achieve object detection on benchmarks. SFGFusion shows superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) datasets. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection, and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features. Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
FadeLead is a novel foreground-centric framework that aims to improve collaborative perception in autonomous vehicles by efficiently sharing contextual information. The method addresses the limitations of existing approaches by learning to incorporate background context into compact foreground features during training. This is achieved through a curricular learning strategy that gradually prunes away background cues, encouraging the model to encode essential context within foreground representations without transmitting the background itself. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FadeLead outperforms previous methods in various bandwidth settings, showcasing the effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing in enhancing the reliability and spatial coverage of autonomous vehicles. <div>
arXiv:2510.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles, offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods, therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project page:https://mingrui-zhao.github.io/4DRep-GMI/

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network (ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action recognition.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework, Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), to improve object counting accuracy in text-to-image diffusion models. These models often struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts. Existing methods use external counting networks as critics, but they are limited to regression-based models. D2D transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics by converting detector logits into soft binary indicators. This allows for leveraging the superior counting ability of detector-based models to guide numeracy generation. Experiments on various benchmarks show substantial improvements in object counting accuracy, with minimal impact on image quality and computational overhead. D2D proves effective across different scenarios, including low-density and multi-object settings, demonstrating its potential for enhancing the performance of semantic alignment in T2I models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

<div> Keywords: signature verification, dynamic features, temporal-spatial graph attention transformer, graph attention network, gated recurrent unit 

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach for dynamic signature verification called Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). This method combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data, enhancing verification accuracy by representing signatures as graphs with dynamic features. The model utilizes attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between these features, and integrates a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module for local and global spatial feature modeling. By incorporating GRU to capture long-term temporal dependencies, TS-GATR outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets like MSDS and DeepSignDB, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) in various scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery. It employs dual-branch encoders, an Attention Feature Fusion module, and a Swin-Transformer fusion block to integrate cross-task features and dynamically weight task objectives. The framework outperforms traditional models and achieves lower RMSE, improving seabed classification accuracy and enhancing spatial consistency. Seabed-Net offers a robust solution for integrated shallow-water mapping by jointly modeling depth, substrate, and seabed habitats. The code and pretrained weights are available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to 75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift. Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces BrainMCLIP, a novel approach for decoding images from fMRI signals that eliminates the need for a separate VAE-based pipeline by aligning fMRI signals to CLIP's intermediate and final layers based on the functional hierarchy of the human visual system. This approach achieves highly competitive performance, especially in high-level semantic metrics, with fewer parameters compared to SOTA methods using VAE pipelines. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, BrainMCLIP captures visual details effectively, striking a balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity. The Cross-Reconstruction strategy and multi-granularity loss further enhance the performance of BrainMCLIP, demonstrating its efficacy in decoding images from fMRI signals while preserving rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers. <div>

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR) using EfficientNetB0 and CLIP. The framework consists of two stages: unsupervised image segmentation and segment-level recognition through vision-language alignment. In the first stage, features from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed and clustered to identify semantically meaningful regions. The second stage involves localizing and encoding segmented regions using CLIP's Vision Transformer backbone. Image and text embeddings are projected into a shared feature space for multi-modal alignment, enabling recognition through similarity computations. The framework outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results highlight the efficacy, adaptability, and performance of the proposed framework.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage, pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment. Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/DaMo.git

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality. Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Summary: 
MV-RoboBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating VLMs in robotic manipulation using multi-view inputs. The benchmark includes 1.7k QA items across spatial understanding and robotic execution tasks. Results show that existing VLMs struggle with multi-view perception, highlighting challenges in robotic reasoning. The study reveals a positive correlation between spatial intelligence and robotic task execution in multi-view scenarios. Strong performance on single-view benchmarks does not guarantee success in multi-view robotic tasks. The benchmark is released as an open resource to advance spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing data and a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19 wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

arXiv:2510.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels: single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person), correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

<div> deep learning, IC defect classification, highly imbalanced data, real-world dataset, multi-expert classifier 

Summary:
The paper introduces the IC-Defect-14 dataset, a highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset from real-world production lines. The dataset's unique characteristics of large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity challenge state-of-the-art classifiers. To address this, ReCAME-Net is proposed, incorporating a multi-expert classifier framework, regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, hard category mining strategy, and knowledge distillation. Experimental results show ReCAME-Net outperforms previous models on IC-Defect-14 while maintaining competitiveness on public datasets. The challenges in real-world IC defect classification are attributed to skewed data distributions and a mix of class-specific and domain-related features in samples. Existing classifiers designed for open imbalanced datasets struggle to perform effectively under these conditions. The proposed approach leverages multiple strategies to overcome these challenges and achieve superior performance on the IC-Defect-14 dataset. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data, applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios. Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14 dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity. These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets, significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net, which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and competitiveness on general public datasets.

arXiv:2510.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations. This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197. Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to 36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for implementing digital rock physics.

<div> MRI, image synthesis, generative model, predictive imaging, reconstruction
Summary:
Generative models powered by artificial intelligence have led to a new approach in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by predicting target contrast images to accelerate image reconstruction. By using diverse data sources like prior scans and patient information, a generative model predicts informative priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled MRI data. The framework was tested on various datasets and yielded superior results compared to traditional methods, especially at high acceleration factors. This novel predictive imaging paradigm shifts the focus from image reconstruction to proactive prediction, enhancing clinical throughput in MRI procedures. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image, which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices), including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors (x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm of predictive imaging.

arXiv:2510.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

<div> Keywords: satellite images, missing data, methane plume detection, imputation approaches, representation bias

Summary:
Missing pixels in satellite images, often not randomly distributed, can lead to bias in automated feature extraction models. In methane plume detection, a spurious association between missing values and the label can cause under-detection of plumes in low-coverage images. To address this bias, multiple imputation methods are evaluated, and a weighted resampling scheme is proposed during training to enforce class balance in each coverage bin. Results show that these techniques significantly reduce representation bias without affecting model performance metrics. Debiasing the models using these approaches improves plume detection in operational scenarios, especially in low-coverage images. <div>

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training. Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces CARES, a Context-Aware Resolution Selector module designed to optimize the processing of images by large vision-language models. By predicting the minimal sufficient input resolution needed for tasks, CARES reduces compute and latency, without compromising task performance. Using a compact VLM and a discrete classifier trained on optional resolutions, CARES can interpolate continuous resolutions at inference for better control. Across several multimodal benchmarks, CARES successfully maintains task performance while significantly decreasing compute resources by up to 80%. This lightweight preprocessing module proves to be effective in improving the efficiency of large vision-language models processing various types of images and documents. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the \emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Summary:<br />
Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs is a challenging task in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle with small or no overlap between images. A new approach called Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) is proposed to address this issue by synthesizing clearer intermediate frames using a video interpolation model and a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model. Additionally, a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence is used to select appropriate intermediate frames for pose estimation. The proposed method, PoseCrafter, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pose estimation, particularly in scenarios with small or no overlap, as demonstrated in experiments on various datasets. <div>
arXiv:2510.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Summary:<br />
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on downstream tasks but struggle with certain aspects of visual reasoning such as identifying relations, understanding temporal sequences, and counting objects. This study evaluates seven state-of-the-art VLMs in a controlled counting task and finds sensitivity to object number, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Errors primarily stem from mapping last-layer representations to outputs. Targeted training by fine-tuning the output layer alone results in accuracy improvements of up to 21%. These findings are substantiated by consistent enhancements on real-world datasets.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

<div> prompt complexity, synthetic data, text-to-image models, evaluation framework, diversity

Summary: 
The study explores the impact of prompt complexity on the utility of synthetic data generated by text-to-image (T2I) models. Synthetic experiments highlight the challenge of generalization with complex prompts, which is further explained theoretically. An evaluation framework is introduced to compare real and synthetic data utility across datasets like CC12M and ImageNet-1k. It is found that increasing prompt complexity reduces conditional diversity and consistency but minimizes the synthetic-to-real distribution shift. Inference-time interventions enhance image diversity but may go beyond real data support. Prompt expansion, utilizing a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, outperforms real data in terms of image diversity and aesthetics. The study underscores the potential of T2I models in generating diverse and high-quality synthetic data with carefully designed prompt interventions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space. These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while being computationally efficient.

Summary:
Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) is introduced as a novel multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that aims to enhance object tracking by leveraging the complementary strengths of RGB and event cameras. The proposed HAD method addresses the significant spatio-temporal asymmetry between the two modalities by implementing a hierarchical alignment strategy to minimize information loss. This strategy maintains computational efficiency and parameter compactness in the student network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HAD compared to state-of-the-art methods in challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and necessity of each component in the HAD framework. The code for implementing HAD will be made available soon. <div>

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Summary:
- The paper introduces an adversarial attack called {\alpha}-Cloak that targets object detectors in the video domain, operating through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
- {\alpha}-Cloak fuses a malicious target video with a benign one through the alpha channel, creating a fused video that deceives object detectors while appearing normal to humans.
- The attack does not require access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and does not introduce noticeable artifacts.
- Support for alpha channels in video formats and playback applications is systematically studied, and a fusion algorithm is designed for visual stealth and compatibility.
- Evaluation on various object detectors, vision-language models, and multi-modal language models shows a 100% success rate, exposing a vulnerability that necessitates the development of defenses considering the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos. {\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

arXiv:2510.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF) limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our findings.

Abstract: Millions of clinical ECGs exist only as paper scans, making them unusable for modern automated diagnostics. We introduce a fully automated, modular framework that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191 ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven diagnostics.

<title>Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592</link>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks. Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

<title>CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance. To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

<title>Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$ curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients. We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents $\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture. It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with deep convolutional network.

<title>Pragmatic Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Generative Communication Mechanism</title>

arXiv:2510.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<title>Augmenting Moment Retrieval: Zero-Dependency Two-Stage Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19622</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19622</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs. ``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1) it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2) it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness. The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model, while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However, their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code, checkpoints, and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Leevan001/MedReason-R1

<title>Re-Activating Frozen Primitives for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19653</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon, where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally, our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

<title>From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs. Code and model weights will be released at https://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature) search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs.

arXiv:2510.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones. Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection (PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

arXiv:2510.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts; and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10 systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance, speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis), as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps. To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions, capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts. CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization, refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth, emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings, with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline. ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity. Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges, particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking algorithms.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization, mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs. This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{} outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded, and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices, exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data. Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9% over existing image-based methods.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura) by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the "EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification, achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main text, we provide our source code and training configurations at https://github.com/nil123532/learning-to-defer-to-a-population-with-limited-demonstrations.

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features. In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision (10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1 second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Abstract: One-class classification (OCC) aims to train a classifier solely on target data and attracts increasing attention due to its applicability in practice. Despite OCC has obtained many advances, it still lacks the effective OCC loss functions for deep learning. In this paper, a novel logarithmic barrier function based OCC loss (LBL) that assigns large gradients to margin samples and thus derives more compact hypersphere is first proposed by approximating the OCC objective smoothly. But the optimization of LBL may be instability especially when samples lie on the boundary leading to the infinity value. To address this issue, a smoother LBLSig loss is further proposed by utilizing a unilateral relaxation Sigmoid function. Experiments on different networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LBL and LBLSig. The source code can be found at https://github.com/ML-HDU/LBL_LBLSig.

Abstract: High speed, high-resolution, and accurate 3D scanning would open doors to many new applications in graphics, robotics, science, and medicine by enabling the accurate scanning of deformable objects during interactions. Past attempts to use structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo in high-speed settings have usually required tradeoffs in resolution or inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables, for the first time, 3D scanning at 450 frames per second at 1~Megapixel, or 1,450 frames per second at 0.4~Megapixel in an environment with controlled lighting. The key idea is to use a per-pixel lookup table that maps colors to depths, which is built using a linear stage. Imperfections, such as lens-distortion and sensor defects are baked into the calibration. We describe our method and test it on a novel hardware prototype. We compare the system with both ground-truth geometry as well as commercially available dynamic sensors like the Microsoft Kinect and Intel Realsense. Our results show the system acquiring geometry of objects undergoing high-speed deformations and oscillations and demonstrate the ability to recover physical properties from the reconstructions.

Abstract: Understanding the hidden mechanisms behind human's visual perception is a fundamental question in neuroscience. To that end, investigating into the neural responses of human mind activities, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has been a significant research vehicle. However, analyzing fMRI signals is challenging, costly, daunting, and demanding for professional training. Despite remarkable progress in fMRI analysis, existing approaches are limited to generating 2D images and far away from being biologically meaningful and practically useful. Under this insight, we propose to generate visually plausible and functionally more comprehensive 3D outputs decoded from brain signals, enabling more sophisticated modeling of fMRI data. Conceptually, we reformulate this task as a {\em fMRI conditioned 3D object generation} problem. We design a novel 3D object representation learning method, Brain3D, that takes as input the fMRI data of a subject who was presented with a 2D image, and yields as output the corresponding 3D object images. The key capabilities of this model include tackling the noises with high-level semantic signals and a two-stage architecture design for progressive high-level information integration. Extensive experiments validate the superior capability of our model over previous state-of-the-art 3D object generation methods. Importantly, we show that our model captures the distinct functionalities of each region of human vision system as well as their intricate interplay relationships, aligning remarkably with the established discoveries in neuroscience. Further, preliminary evaluations indicate that Brain3D can successfully identify the disordered brain regions in simulated scenarios, such as V1, V2, V3, V4, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) within the human visual system. Our data and code will be available at https://brain-3d.github.io/.

Abstract: We propose ComDrive: the first comfort-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving system to generate temporally consistent and comfortable trajectories. Recent studies have demonstrated that imitation learning-based planners and learning-based trajectory scorers can effectively generate and select safety trajectories that closely mimic expert demonstrations. However, such trajectory planners and scorers face the challenge of generating temporally inconsistent and uncomfortable trajectories. To address these issues, ComDrive first extracts 3D spatial representations through sparse perception, which then serves as conditional inputs. These inputs are used by a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)-based motion planner to generate temporally consistent multi-modal trajectories. A dual-stream adaptive trajectory scorer subsequently selects the most comfortable trajectory from these candidates to control the vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that ComDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both comfort and safety, outperforming UniAD by 17% in driving comfort and reducing collision rates by 25% compared to SparseDrive. More results are available on our project page: https://jmwang0117.github.io/ComDrive/.

Abstract: In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&amp;W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.

Abstract: Existing tone mapping methods operate on downsampled inputs and rely on handcrafted pyramids to recover high-frequency details. These designs typically fail to preserve fine textures and structural fidelity in complex HDR scenes. Furthermore, most methods lack an effective mechanism to jointly model global tone consistency and local contrast enhancement, leading to globally flat or locally inconsistent outputs such as halo artifacts. We present the Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet), an end-to-end framework for high-fidelity tone mapping. At its core is a learnable differential pyramid that generalizes traditional Laplacian and Difference-of-Gaussian pyramids through content-aware differencing operations across scales. This allows DPRNet to adaptively capture high-frequency variations under diverse luminance and contrast conditions. To enforce perceptual consistency, DPRNet incorporates global tone perception and local tone tuning modules operating on downsampled inputs, enabling efficient yet expressive tone adaptation. Finally, an iterative detail enhancement module progressively restores the full-resolution output in a coarse-to-fine manner, reinforcing structure and sharpness. Experiments show that DPRNet achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 2.39 dB on the 4K HDR+ dataset and 3.01 dB on the 4K HDRI Haven dataset, while producing perceptually coherent, detail-preserving results. \textit{We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxdprnet.github.io/DPRNet/.

<title>VLsI: Verbalized Layers-to-Interactions from Large to Small Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: The recent surge in high-quality visual instruction tuning samples from closed-source vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V has accelerated the release of open-source VLMs across various model sizes. However, scaling VLMs to improve performance using larger models brings significant computational challenges, especially for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile platforms and robots. To address this, we propose VLsI: Verbalized Layers-to-Interactions, a new VLM family in 2B and 7B model sizes, which prioritizes efficiency without compromising accuracy. VLsI leverages a unique, layer-wise distillation process, introducing intermediate "verbalizers" that map features from each layer to natural language space, allowing smaller VLMs to flexibly align with the reasoning processes of larger VLMs. This approach mitigates the training instability often encountered in output imitation and goes beyond typical final-layer tuning by aligning the small VLMs' layer-wise progression with that of the large ones. We validate VLsI across ten challenging vision-language benchmarks, achieving notable performance gains (11.0% for 2B and 17.4% for 7B) over GPT-4V without the need for model scaling, merging, or architectural changes.

Abstract: We present ASAP, a new framework for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM4).Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM4 methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM4 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin.

Abstract: Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact with real-world environments that contain tightly intertwined visual and textual information, often through raw camera pixels rather than separately processed images and tokenized text. This shift highlights the need for a unified perception paradigm. To investigate this idea, we explore Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and introduce PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical, and diagrammatic inputs into a shared pixel space. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that PEAP achieves comparable performance to token-based approaches on semantic understanding tasks, suggesting that vision transformers can partially capture global textual semantics without explicit tokenization. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and code show notable performance degradation, although Chain-of-Thought prompting helps mitigate this gap by compensating for missing symbolic structure. We further find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels simplifies preprocessing and avoids cross-modal misalignment. PixelWorld thus provides a systematic and practical framework for evaluating unified vision--language models and facilitates further exploration of pixel-based multimodal learning.

<title>MsEdF: A Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework for Remote Sensing Image Captioning</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing images contain complex spatial patterns and semantic structures, which makes the captioning model difficult to accurately describe. Encoder-decoder architectures have become the widely used approach for RSIC by translating visual content into descriptive text. However, many existing methods rely on a single-stream architecture, which weakens the model to accurately describe the image. Such single-stream architectures typically struggle to extract diverse spatial features or capture complex semantic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in scenes with high intraclass similarity or contextual ambiguity. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework (MsEdF) which improves the performance of RSIC by optimizing both the spatial representation and language generation of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder fuses information from two complementary image encoders, thereby promoting feature diversity through the integration of multiscale and structurally distinct cues. To improve the capture of context-aware descriptions, we refine the input sequence's semantic modeling on the decoder side using a stacked GRU architecture with an element-wise aggregation scheme. Experiments on three benchmark RSIC datasets show that MsEdF outperforms several baseline models.

Abstract: Perceptual constancy is the ability to maintain stable perceptions of objects despite changes in sensory input, such as variations in distance, angle, or lighting. This ability is crucial for visual understanding in a dynamic world. Here, we explored such ability in current Vision Language Models (VLMs). In this study, we evaluated 155 VLMs using 236 experiments across three domains: color, size, and shape constancy. The experiments included single-image and video adaptations of classic cognitive tasks, along with novel tasks in in-the-wild conditions. We found significant variability in VLM performance across these domains, with model performance in shape constancy clearly dissociated from that of color and size constancy.

Abstract: We present FLARE, a feed-forward model designed to infer high-quality camera poses and 3D geometry from uncalibrated sparse-view images (i.e., as few as 2-8 inputs), which is a challenging yet practical setting in real-world applications. Our solution features a cascaded learning paradigm with camera pose serving as the critical bridge, recognizing its essential role in mapping 3D structures onto 2D image planes. Concretely, FLARE starts with camera pose estimation, whose results condition the subsequent learning of geometric structure and appearance, optimized through the objectives of geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Utilizing large-scale public datasets for training, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of pose estimation, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while maintaining the inference efficiency (i.e., less than 0.5 seconds).

<title>Towards Enhanced Image Generation Via Multi-modal Chain of Thought in Unified Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Unified generative models have shown remarkable performance in text and image generation. For image synthesis tasks, they adopt straightforward text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, direct T2I generation limits the models in handling complex compositional instructions, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Although this issue is vital, existing works mainly focus on improving the basic image generation capability of the models. While such improvements help to some extent, they still fail to adequately resolve the problem. Inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) solving complex problems step by step, this work aims to introduce CoT into unified generative models to address the challenges of complex image generation that direct T2I generation cannot effectively solve, thereby endowing models with enhanced image generation ability. To achieve this, we first propose Functionality-oriented eXperts (FoXperts), an expert-parallel architecture in our model FoX, which assigns experts by function. FoXperts disentangles potential conflicts in mainstream modality-oriented designs and provides a solid foundation for CoT. When introducing CoT, the first question is how to design it for complex image generation. To this end, we emulate a human-like artistic workflow -- planning, acting, reflection, and correction -- and propose the Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) approach, as the data involves both text and image. To address the subsequent challenge -- designing an effective MCoT training paradigm -- we develop a multi-task joint training scheme that equips the model with all capabilities required for each MCoT step in a disentangled manner. This paradigm avoids the difficulty of collecting consistent multi-step data tuples. Extensive experiments show that FoX consistently outperforms existing unified models on various T2I benchmarks, delivering notable improvements in complex image generation.

Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 first-person videos from the daily lives of blind and visually impaired individuals. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or verified by the blind to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance. Each question has an average of 3 manually annotated reference answers to reduce subjectiveness. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle. The best performers achieve an accuracy near 60\%, which is far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope that EgoBlind will serve as a foundation for developing effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind and visually impaired.

Abstract: Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

Abstract: We introduce the task of grounded article generation with the goal of creating a Wikipedia-style article from multiple diverse videos about real-world events -- from natural disasters to political elections -- where all the information in the article is supported by video evidence. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text while existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher-level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.

Abstract: Real-time wildlife detection in drone imagery supports critical ecological and conservation monitoring. However, standard detection models like YOLO often fail to generalize across locations and struggle with rare species, limiting their use in automated drone deployments. We present MMLA, a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude drone dataset collected across three sites (Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The Wilds in Ohio), featuring six species (zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African wild dogs). The dataset contains 811K annotations from 37 high-resolution videos. Baseline YOLO models show performance disparities across locations while fine-tuning YOLOv11m on MMLA improves mAP50 to 82%, a 52-point gain over baseline. Our results underscore the need for diverse training data to enable robust animal detection in autonomous drone systems.

Abstract: 3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation methods. We also propose a 3D visual illusion depth estimation framework that uses common sense from the vision language model to adaptively fuse depth from binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular, binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various 3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks promise brain-inspired and energy-efficient computation by transmitting information through binary (0/1) spikes. Yet, their performance still lags behind that of artificial neural networks, often assumed to result from information loss caused by sparse and binary activations. In this work, we challenge this long-standing assumption and reveal a previously overlooked frequency bias: spiking neurons inherently suppress high-frequency components and preferentially propagate low-frequency information. This frequency-domain imbalance, we argue, is the root cause of degraded feature representation in SNNs. Empirically, on Spiking Transformers, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73% on Cifar-100, whereas replacing it with Max-Pool (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: (1) extra Max-Pool in patch embedding, and (2) Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, Max-Former attains 82.39% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using only 63.99M parameters, surpassing Spikformer (74.81%, 66.34M) by +7.58%. Extending our insight beyond transformers, our Max-ResNet-18 achieves state-of-the-art performance on convolution-based benchmarks: 97.17% on CIFAR-10 and 83.06\% on CIFAR-100. We hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the distinctive nature of spiking neural networks. Code is available: https://github.com/bic-L/MaxFormer.

Abstract: Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose LIAR, a novel framework that learns illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently,3D-IDP enhances semantic understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios. The source code and pretrained models are available [here](https://github.com/yanzq95/LIAR).

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of symbol layouts and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced performance bottlenecks by proposing isolated architectural modifications, making them difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile, recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture, effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework. Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought (Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC) for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves super state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31\% and the top-performing VLM Gemini2.5-flash by 24.42\% under zero-shot setting.

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method called the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach utilizes a 3D visual geometry encoder to extract 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is then integrated with visual tokens and input into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

Abstract: Many studies have been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for the further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it was noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason which is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called merit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal approximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of fit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one can be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are theoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and non-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a suboptimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other suboptimal scheme,as indicated by Rosin's measure,then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using a weighted figure of merit,so one cannot use a weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment, including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor generalization, (ii) sparse-beam & dense-beam adaptation, and (iii) non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data, our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11% absolute improvement (83% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models, mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching (CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable potential of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoders. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Our code is available at https://github.com/isno0907/ldmae.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.

Abstract: The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics, including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods, drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras, vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance.

Abstract: Weight space learning aims to extract information about a neural network, such as its training dataset or generalization error. Recent approaches learn directly from model weights, but this presents many challenges as weights are high-dimensional and include permutation symmetries between neurons. An alternative approach, Probing, represents a model by passing a set of learned inputs (probes) through the model, and training a predictor on top of the corresponding outputs. Although probing is typically not used as a stand alone approach, our preliminary experiment found that a vanilla probing baseline worked surprisingly well. However, we discover that current probe learning strategies are ineffective. We therefore propose Deep Linear Probe Generators (ProbeGen), a simple and effective modification to probing approaches. ProbeGen adds a shared generator module with a deep linear architecture, providing an inductive bias towards structured probes thus reducing overfitting. While simple, ProbeGen performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art and is very efficient, requiring between 30 to 1000 times fewer FLOPs than other top approaches.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) enables detailed cross-sectional imaging but continues to face challenges in balancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. While deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image quality and noise reduction, they typically require large-scale training data and intensive computation. Recent advances in scene reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer alternative perspectives but are not well-suited for direct volumetric CT reconstruction. In this work, we propose Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR), a novel framework that reconstructs the 3D volume directly using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce Fast Volume Reconstruction, a highly parallelized technique that aggregates Gaussian contributions into the voxel grid with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and runtime performance across various CT reconstruction scenarios.

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.

Abstract: Persistent homology is a widely-used tool in topological data analysis (TDA) for understanding the underlying shape of complex data. By constructing a filtration of simplicial complexes from data points, it captures topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids across multiple scales. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams (PDs), which provide a concise summary of the data's topological structure. However, the non-Hilbert nature of the space of PDs poses challenges for their direct use in machine learning applications. To address this, kernel methods and vectorization techniques have been developed to transform PDs into machine-learning-compatible formats. In this paper, we introduce a new software package designed to streamline the vectorization of PDs, offering an intuitive workflow and advanced functionalities. We demonstrate the necessity of the package through practical examples and provide a detailed discussion on its contributions to applied TDA. Definitions of all vectorization summaries used in the package are included in the appendix.

<title>FairGen: Controlling Sensitive Attributes for Fair Generations in Diffusion Models via Adaptive Latent Guidance</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups, such as generating more males than females when prompted to generate images of engineers, raising ethical concerns and limiting their adoption. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., "male" for "gender") in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose FairGen, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Furthermore, we address the limitations of existing datasets by introducing the Holistic Bias Evaluation (HBE) benchmark, which covers diverse domains and incorporates complex prompts to assess bias more comprehensively. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight FairGen's ability to flexibly control the output distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.

Abstract: We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.

<title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers?</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation that consists of learnable activation functions, with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep networks, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). This work asks whether KAN could learn token interactions. In this paper, we design the first learnable attention called Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for ViTs that can operate on any basis, ranging from Fourier, Wavelets, Splines, to Rational Functions. However, learnable activations in the attention cause a memory explosion. To remedy this, we propose a modular version of KArAt that uses a low-rank approximation. By adopting the Fourier basis, Fourier-KArAt and its variants, in some cases, outperform their traditional softmax counterparts, or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. We also deploy Fourier KArAt to ConViT and Swin-Transformer, and use it in detection and segmentation with ViT-Det. We dissect the performance of these architectures by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer paths, attention visualizations, and transferability to other datasets. KArAt's learnable activation yields a better attention score across all ViTs, indicating improved token-to-token interactions and contributing to enhanced inference. Still, its generalizability does not scale with larger ViTs. However, many factors, including the present computing interface, affect the relative performance of parameter- and memory-heavy KArAts. We note that the goal of this paper is not to produce efficient attention or challenge the traditional activations; by designing KArAt, we are the first to show that attention can be learned and encourage researchers to explore KArAt in conjunction with more advanced architectures.

Abstract: The field of Novel View Synthesis has been revolutionized by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables high-quality scene reconstruction that can be rendered in real-time. 3DGS-based techniques typically suffer from high GPU memory and disk storage requirements which limits their practical application on consumer-grade devices. We propose Opti3DGS, a novel frequency-modulated coarse-to-fine optimization framework that aims to minimize the number of Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, thus reducing memory and storage demands. Opti3DGS leverages image frequency modulation, initially enforcing a coarse scene representation and progressively refining it by modulating frequency details in the training images. On the baseline 3DGS, we demonstrate an average reduction of 62% in Gaussians, a 40% reduction in the training GPU memory requirements and a 20% reduction in optimization time without sacrificing the visual quality. Furthermore, we show that our method integrates seamlessly with many 3DGS-based techniques, consistently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives while maintaining, and often improving, visual quality. Additionally, Opti3DGS inherently produces a level-of-detail scene representation at no extra cost, a natural byproduct of the optimization pipeline. Results and code will be made publicly available.

arXiv:2505.11576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to the original training data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning. However, existing methods face two critical challenges: parameter interference among tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting, and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. To address these issues, we introduce the task of Test-Time Continual Model Merging (TTCMM), which leverages a small set of unlabeled test samples during inference to alleviate parameter conflicts and handle distribution shifts. We propose MINGLE, a novel framework for TTCMM. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture with parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, which enhances adaptability to evolving test distributions while dynamically merging models to mitigate conflicts. To further reduce forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations, thereby suppressing activations on old tasks and preserving past knowledge. We further introduce an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy that adjusts constraint strength dynamically based on interference signals observed during test-time adaptation, striking a balance between stability and adaptability. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, significantly reduces forgetting, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9% on average across diverse task orders.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques. Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods, particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR scenarios.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

<title>Unfolding Generative Flows with Koopman Operators: Fast and Interpretable Sampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.22304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) enable elegant generative modeling but remain bottlenecked by slow sampling: producing a single sample requires solving a nonlinear ODE with hundreds of function evaluations. Recent approaches such as Rectified Flow and OT-CFM accelerate sampling by straightening trajectories, yet the learned dynamics remain nonlinear black boxes, limiting both efficiency and interpretability. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: globally linearizing flow dynamics via Koopman theory. By lifting Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) into a higher-dimensional Koopman space, we represent its evolution with a single linear operator. This yields two key benefits. First, sampling becomes one-step and parallelizable, computed in closed form via the matrix exponential. Second, the Koopman operator provides a spectral blueprint of generation, enabling novel interpretability through its eigenvalues and modes. We derive a practical, simulation-free training objective that enforces infinitesimal consistency with the teacher's dynamics and show that this alignment preserves fidelity along the full generative path, distinguishing our method from boundary-only distillation. Empirically, our approach achieves competitive sample quality with dramatic speedups, while uniquely enabling spectral analysis of generative flows.

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized images in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

arXiv:2507.16814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues, this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward. Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively. Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy training.

<title>Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy</title>

arXiv:2508.18404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second viewings of "Where's Waldo?", we report a new memory-dependent effect that also varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last $\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal, vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.

For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification. On the final test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.6972 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8242 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.

Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.

Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as manufacturing and industrial vision systems.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the resilience of advanced vision language models (VLMs) in recognizing fragmented and perturbed text in Chinese and English writing systems. While human readers can still understand words even when characters are manipulated, contemporary VLMs struggle with such stimuli, often producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The study highlights the models' reliance on generic visual invariances and lack of compositional priors essential for robust literacy. The research calls for improved architectures and training strategies that incorporate symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across different scripts. The findings have implications for the development of multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security. The paper provides code, prompts, and evaluation protocols for transparent replication and further investigations. <div>

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

Summary: 
CoIDO is a novel framework for optimizing data selection in multimodal large language models. It addresses the challenges of computational cost and suboptimal data selection by jointly optimizing data importance and diversity. CoIDO utilizes a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample of data, reducing computational demands significantly. Through a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and diversity during training. In experiments, the CoIDO scorer, trained on only 20 percent of randomly sampled data, selected a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. This subset achieved 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning on average across ten downstream tasks using the LLaVA-1.5-7B model. This demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of CoIDO in selecting high-quality data subsets for instruction tuning in multimodal large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set, drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on average.

<div> diffusion model, treatment response prediction, glioblastoma, MRI, personalized medicine
Summary:
The study focuses on predicting treatment response in glioblastoma patients using a novel approach called Latent Diffusion Model. The model takes pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization as input to generate post-treatment MRI, reflecting tumor evolution. Unlike traditional methods, this model does not rely on timeseries data. It incorporates a conditioning mechanism and uses survival information to enhance generation quality. The study dataset includes pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor localization, and survival data from 140 GBM patients. By accurately predicting treatment response early on, this model aims to improve personalized medicine strategies for GBM patients, who exhibit heterogeneous responses to standard treatment protocols. <div>
arXiv:2510.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution, while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts, and survival information.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenge of verifying the authenticity of digital content created by advanced generative AI models. They propose an embedding-based AI image detection framework that leverages image embeddings and vector similarity to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created images. The methodology is based on the idea that AI-generated images have closer embedding proximity to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster together within their domain. Through experimentation with five benchmark embedding models, the system shows robustness in differentiating between AI-generated and human-created images, even when perturbations are introduced. The results confirm that perturbed images maintain close similarity to their original versions. This approach provides a generalizable framework for accurately detecting AI-generated images while being computationally efficient. <div>

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication. Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of backchannels in conversations and how individual differences influence the expression of these subtle listener responses. It presents a novel approach, CMIS-Net, which extracts individual-normalized backchannel features to address the complexity of multi-scale behavioral cues. By operating at both frame and sequence levels, CMIS-Net focuses on relative changes from each person's baseline rather than absolute expression values. The model also includes an implicit data augmentation module to improve generalization by addressing training data distributional bias. Through comprehensive experiments and visualizations, CMIS-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection, effectively handling individual differences and data imbalance. <div>

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like, responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level) to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level). This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.

Summary:
This article introduces an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step samplers. The method leverages novel velocity field self-distillation, enabling rapid training without the need for specialized step-size embedding. By imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism to standard flow matching models like Flux, the approach achieves training efficiency, producing a 3-step Flux model in less than one A100 day. The method can also be integrated into the pretraining stage to inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. Additionally, it introduces the first few-shot distillation method for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art performance at minimal cost. <div>

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding incompatible with existing models unless retraining from scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g., producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

Traditional human activity recognition methods for scuba diving safety often face limitations in underwater environments. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that combines computer vision with motion data to monitor scuba diver safety more effectively. By using computer vision to generate high-quality motion data from 3D human joint keypoints, a "pseudo-IMU" is created, overcoming wireless signal attenuation issues in water. The system is designed to identify anomalous scuba diver behavior indicative of medical emergencies like cardiac arrest, a significant cause of scuba diving fatalities. By integrating the classifier onto an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and conducting experiments with simulated distress scenarios, the method proves to be valuable for enhancing robotic monitoring and improving diver safety.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a ``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings, where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM) to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic, handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation.

Summary:
- The study audits five popular gender classification datasets and uncovers significant underrepresentation of intersectional demographics in their training data.
- MobileNetV2 classifiers trained on the more balanced datasets, UTKFace and FairFace, exhibit bias towards misclassifying female faces and amplifying racial skew.
- A new dataset, BalancedFace, is introduced, composed of real, unedited images from FairFace, UTKFace, and other sources to address demographic gaps and create balanced subgroup shares.
- Training a standard classifier on BalancedFace reduces the True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and improves the average Disparate Impact score by 63% compared to other datasets, while maintaining high overall accuracy.
- The results highlight the importance of data-centric interventions in promoting fairness in gender classification and provide a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace, it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender classification research.

arXiv:2510.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage, ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models. Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

Summary:  
- The study evaluates segmentation models in MRI image analysis and considers the impact of demographic factors like race and sex on segmentation accuracy and volumes of the nucleus accumbens (NAc).  
- Three deep learning models and one traditional method are tested on datasets of different demographic subgroups.  
- Fairness is quantitatively assessed using a specific metric, with training on matching race data showing improved segmentation accuracy for some models.  
- Sex effects on NAc volume are observed in both manual and biased segmentations, while race effects are diminished in most models.

arXiv:2510.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data. Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female, and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241 participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order (94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent, n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001, permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems tailored to non Western contexts.

<div> Keywords: autonomous driving systems, Vision Language Models, anomaly detection, semantic analysis, structured reasoning

Summary:
SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection) is a new framework designed to detect anomalous driving scenarios in autonomous systems. By leveraging Vision Language Models and employing structured reasoning across four semantic layers, SAVANT achieves high recall and accuracy in identifying out-of-distribution scenarios. The framework utilizes a two-phase pipeline for scene analysis, leading to improved performance compared to baseline approaches. SAVANT not only outperforms existing models in anomaly detection but also enables the deployment of a fine-tuned open-source model for semantic monitoring at low cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the challenge of data scarcity in anomaly detection for autonomous systems. This structured approach provides a practical and reliable solution for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving technology. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification, all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation time and improving dataset reliability.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset, which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Summary: 
Chimera is a personalized image generation model that allows for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images based on textual instructions. The model is trained on a dataset of semantic atoms representing unique part-subject pairs. By using a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, Chimera enforces both semantic identity and spatial layout in the generated images. A new objective metric called PartEval is introduced to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of the generated images. Human evaluations and PartEval show that Chimera outperforms other models in terms of part alignment, compositional accuracy, and visual quality, displaying a 14% improvement in part alignment and compositional accuracy and a 21% improvement in visual quality. <div>

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions. To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464 unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges, such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training of ML models.

Summary:
Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT) introduces the concept of using multiple patch sizes within the same image to address the issue of long input sequences in Vision Transformers (ViTs) for high-resolution images. By allocating larger patch sizes in more uniform areas and smaller patches in complex regions, APT improves ViT inference and training speed by up to 50% while maintaining performance. APT can also be applied to pre-trained ViTs with fast convergence in just 1 epoch. Furthermore, APT significantly reduces training and inference time in high-resolution visual tasks such as visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation without sacrificing performance, achieving up to 30% faster processing speeds. <div>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image. APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1 epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\% faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Summary:
The tutorial discusses the transformation in 3D reconstruction from posed images due to advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS models scenes as collections of 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient rasterization with volumetric splatting and integration with graphics pipelines. While offering real-time rendering for new view synthesis, 3DGS faces challenges like high memory usage, baked lighting effects in representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. The tutorial covers the 3DGS pipeline, efforts to overcome its limitations, and applications like surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, and content generation that benefit from its efficient rendering and compatibility with feed-forward pipelines. <div>

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians, 3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for feed-forward pipelines.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings. Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's zero-shot performance.

<div> Keywords: collaborative driving systems, V2X communication, natural language, safety, security

Summary:
Collaborative driving systems use natural language communication for enhanced safety and efficiency by reducing bandwidth demands and improving human-machine interoperability.
However, this shift introduces new vulnerabilities such as message loss, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
The study presents a taxonomy of attack strategies including connection disruption, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery.
To address these risks, the SafeCoop agentic defense pipeline integrates semantic firewall, consistency checks, and multi-source consensus.
Evaluation in CARLA simulation shows a significant driving score improvement under malicious attacks and high F1 scores for malicious detection.
The research provides valuable insights for developing secure and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

<div> Closed-loop evaluation, World models, Embodied tasks, Visual quality, Decision making
Summary:
Surprisingly, visual quality alone does not ensure success in embodied tasks; controllability is more crucial. Additionally, scaling post-training with action-observation data proves more effective than enhancing pretrained video generators. Allocating more inference-time compute enables world models to significantly enhance closed-loop performance. The study introduces World-in-World, an open platform for benchmarking world models in closed-loop environments, providing a standardized action API and online planning strategy. By prioritizing task success as the primary metric and moving beyond visual quality, diverse world models are rigorously evaluated. The study also reveals the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models, trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue, we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo. We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Summary:
VelocityNet is a new framework designed to detect anomalies in crowded scenes by combining head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. These velocities are categorized into semantic motion classes using hierarchical clustering, allowing for a more interpretable analysis of motion patterns. An anomaly scoring system then measures deviations from learned normal patterns, providing a reliable indicator of anomalous behavior. The framework is capable of real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within densely crowded environments, making it a valuable tool for security and surveillance applications. <div>
arXiv:2510.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns. Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal, and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is precisely designed to support the development of models that produce descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently, we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M, capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation. RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs, effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Summary:<br />
Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is often treated with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), and accurate segmentation of lesions in ultrasound videos is challenging due to various factors. The EMA-SAM model, an extension of SAM-2, improves segmentation accuracy by incorporating a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank, providing a stable prototype of the tumor across frames. This design allows for better temporal coherence and adaptation in the presence of artifacts. On a PTMC-RFA dataset, EMA-SAM significantly enhances segmentation performance and reduces false positives. It also outperforms SAM-2 on external benchmarks, maintaining real-time processing speeds. EMA-SAM proves to be a robust and efficient framework for accurate and stable tumor tracking in interventional ultrasound. <div>
arXiv:2510.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce \textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2) to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2. Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

<div> Framework, Multimodal Safety, Severity Classification, Combinatorial Analysis, Benchmark.<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces the Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU) framework for evaluating multimodal safety by considering joint interpretation of vision and language inputs. They analyze 17 safety patterns across 8,187 samples, revealing that existing models struggle in joint image-text reasoning and compositional understanding. While achieving high accuracy in unimodal signals, models perform poorly (20-55%) in joint safety classification. The study also highlights the challenge of balancing engagement with borderline cases and refusal of unsafe content. An example shows that adjusting instruction framing can decrease over-blocking on borderline content but at the expense of under-refusal on unsafe content. The findings emphasize the need for improved joint image-text understanding and alignment in current multimodal models, serving as a crucial test bed for future research on robust vision-language safety.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

<div> Debiasing, Object Detection, Generation Framework, Representation Score, Layout-to-Image Synthesis

Summary: 
This paper introduces a generation-based debiasing framework for object detection that addresses limitations of previous methods. By introducing a representation score (RS), gaps in representation diversity are identified beyond just instance frequency, leading to the creation of unbiased layouts. To improve the quality of synthesis, ambiguous text prompts are replaced with precise visual blueprints, and a generative alignment strategy is employed to enhance communication between the detector and generator. The method significantly improves performance for underrepresented object groups, such as large and rare instances, surpassing prior layout-to-image synthesis models in layout accuracy in generated images. <div>
arXiv:2510.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii) current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy in generated images.

Summary:
DeepSeek-OCR is a novel model that explores the feasibility of compressing long contexts using optical 2D mapping. It consists of DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder, with the former designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input.

It outperforms existing models like GOT-OCR2.0 and MinerU2.0 on benchmarks like OmniDocBench, using fewer vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate large-scale training data for LLMs/VLMs at high speeds. The model's codes and weights are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers in the field. The research also shows promise for applications in historical long-context compression and understanding memory mechanisms in large language models. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

<div> Keywords: Zero-shot learning, 3D object classification, domain adaptation, multimodal pretraining, real-world data <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework aimed at improving zero-shot 3D object classification by bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data. By generating a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets from real-world driving data and synthetic CAD data, the framework utilizes a curriculum-based data mixing strategy to gradually adapt the model to real-world characteristics. Adding just 1.5% of real-world samples during training significantly boosts zero-shot accuracy on benchmarks like nuScenes. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on outdoor datasets like nuScenes and TruckScenes, outperforming previous methods by 19.3%. The study highlights the importance of domain adaptation over full-scale real-world annotation for robust 3D perception. The code and dataset will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains. We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes. However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary \textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.

<div> Hierarchical structure, 3D human mesh recovery, Hyperbolic space learning, Temporal motion prior, Optimization learning strategy 

Summary:
This article introduces a method for recovering 3D human meshes from videos by leveraging hyperbolic space learning and temporal motion prior. The proposed approach extracts temporal motion features and combines them into a motion prior to enhance feature expression in the temporal dimension. By representing data in a non-Euclidean space, specifically in hyperbolic space, the method aims to capture hierarchical relationships accurately. A hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy is employed using the temporal motion prior to optimize mesh features based on 3D pose and pose motion information. Additionally, a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss is proposed to ensure stability and effectiveness in the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the method compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques on large datasets. <div>
arXiv:2510.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior. In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features. Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding. UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks: detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms, and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration. Our code and benchmark will be available.

<div> Keywords: 3D human mesh recovery, latent information, attention mechanisms, low-dimensional learning, pose interaction

Summary: 
The article introduces a two-stage network for 3D human mesh recovery that effectively utilizes latent information and low-dimensional learning techniques. In the first stage, global and local information is extracted from low and high-frequency image features to create a hybrid latent frequency domain feature, improving shape alignment and detail in reconstructed human meshes. The second stage focuses on optimizing the pose and shape of the human mesh by modeling interaction learning between the mesh template and 3D poses. This interaction is achieved through a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method that reduces computational costs while maintaining reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods on large datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local (e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage, with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority compared to the most state-of-the-art.

arXiv:2510.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD) problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper, we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

<div> StreamingTOM, two-stage framework, streaming video vision-language models, causality, accumulation <br />
Summary:<br />
StreamingTOM is a new framework designed to address the constraints faced by streaming video vision-language models. It tackles the issues of causality and accumulation by introducing two key components: Causal Temporal Reduction and Online Quantized Memory. Causal Temporal Reduction reduces the pre-LLM bottleneck by processing only a subset of visual tokens per frame, based on frame changes and token saliency. Online Quantized Memory helps manage memory efficiently by storing tokens in a 4-bit format, retrieving relevant groups on demand, and dequantizing them as needed. The experimental results show that StreamingTOM achieves significant compression in kv-cache, lower peak memory usage, and faster processing times compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Despite being training-free, StreamingTOM maintains high accuracy levels on offline benchmarks and RVS, demonstrating its practical benefits for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

<div> face editing, generative models, 3D faces, attribute editing, deep learning 

Summary:
This article discusses the challenges of identity preserving editing for 3D faces and presents a method to address these challenges. The method aims to identify latent space directions for efficient few-shot attribute editing in 3D-aware generative models. By leveraging recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques, the method demonstrates that just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute are sufficient to estimate edit directions in the latent space. The approach also shows the linearity of edits through one-shot stylization and continuous style manipulation for 3D-consistent identity preserving face aging. The use of an existing face dataset with masks allows for obtaining synthetic images for attribute examples necessary for estimating edit directions. The experimental results and code for the method are available for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits, we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework called Med-RwR for enhancing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in medical applications. Existing medical MLLMs often struggle with reasoning beyond their training scope, leading to inaccuracies. The proposed framework leverages external knowledge by actively retrieving relevant information during reasoning, combining visual diagnostic findings with textual clinical information. A two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards encourages the model to effectively utilize both modalities for retrieval. Additionally, a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval method is introduced for improving performance during test-time scaling. Evaluation on diverse medical benchmarks showcases the effectiveness of Med-RwR in enhancing reasoning capabilities and generalizability to unfamiliar domains. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models and shows promise in transparently analyzing medical scans and providing reliable diagnoses. <div>
arXiv:2510.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Misalignment between training and inference resolutions is shown to severely degrade performance. Mixed-resolution training is recommended to mitigate misalignment and balance computational constraints with performance requirements.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3) mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Summary: 
OmniNWM is introduced as an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses state, action, and reward dimensions in autonomous driving applications. It generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy for a comprehensive state representation. A normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation is used for precise action control. Unlike existing models, OmniNWM leverages 3D occupancy to define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety, eliminating the need for external image-based reward models. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability. The project page is available on GitHub for reference and further exploration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Summary:<br />
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive results in multimodal tasks, but they are prone to object hallucination. In response to this issue, the Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED) framework has been proposed. ATED is a training-free, token-level ensemble approach that aggregates predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. By dynamically determining uncertainty-based weights for each model and integrating diverse decoding paths, ATED improves contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experimental results on hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. This approach highlights the benefits of adaptive ensembling and offers a promising direction for enhancing LVLM robustness in critical applications. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications.

This network combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment.

arXiv:2510.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness. Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points. Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV 2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints, providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks, including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM). During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Summary:
AV-Master is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) that addresses the limitations of existing methods by enhancing the model's ability to extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes. It introduces a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism in the temporal dimension to focus on relevant segments, and a preference-aware strategy in the modality dimension to activate critical features independently. The framework also utilizes a dual-path contrastive loss to reinforce consistency and complementarity across dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal collaborative representations. Experimental results on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AV-Master outperforms existing methods, particularly in complex reasoning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

<div> framework, Diffusion-DRO, preference learning, inverse reinforcement learning, ranking optimization  
Summary:  
Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO) is a novel preference learning framework that simplifies training objectives by treating preference learning as a ranking problem. By removing the need for a reward model and integrating offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, Diffusion-DRO effectively captures human preferences and overcomes the limitations of offline datasets. This method addresses challenges faced by existing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) methods, such as accurately estimating image probabilities and limited dataset diversity. Diffusion-DRO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies, delivering improved generation quality across a variety of prompts. The source code and pre-trained models for Diffusion-DRO are publicly available, showcasing its potential for advancing text-to-image diffusion model alignment with human preferences.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning. Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and user studies.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

<title>FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover, no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy, video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

<title>Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment for Image Complexity Assessment</title>

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding. However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at https://github.com/XQ2K/First-Cross-Model-ICA.

<title>S2AP: Score-space Sharpness Minimization for Adversarial Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model, (ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

<title>Entropy-Enhanced Conformal Features from Ricci Flow for Robust Alzheimer's Disease Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18396</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results: Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical research applications.

<title>Bayesian Fully-Connected Tensor Network for Hyperspectral-Multispectral Image Fusion</title>

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion (HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure. Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated system for cricket video analysis that leverages deep learning techniques to extract wicket-taking deliveries, detect cricket balls, and model ball trajectories. The system employs the YOLOv8 architecture for pitch and ball detection, combined with optical character recognition (OCR) for scorecard extraction to identify wicket-taking moments. Through comprehensive image preprocessing, including grayscale transformation, power transformation, and morphological operations, the system achieves robust text extraction from video frames. The pitch detection model achieved 99.5% mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) with a precision of 0.999, while the ball detection model using transfer learning attained 99.18% mAP50 with 0.968 precision and 0.978 recall. The system enables trajectory modeling on detected pitches, providing data-driven insights for identifying batting weaknesses. Experimental results on multiple cricket match videos demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for automated cricket analytics, offering significant potential for coaching and strategic decision-making.

arXiv:2510.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs. Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs, highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas, as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

<title>Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaohainku/RISE.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions, enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or healthcare professionals.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR) videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste, making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier, EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency (~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However, failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation, we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025: Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust, object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance demonstrated in this challenge.

<title>Descriptor: Occluded nuScenes: A Multi-Sensor Dataset for Evaluating Perception Robustness in Automated Driving</title>

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference. By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

<title>Kaleido: Open-Sourced Multi-Subject Reference Video Generation Model</title>

arXiv:2510.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models. While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

<title>Think with 3D: Geometric Imagination Grounded Spatial Reasoning from Limited Views</title>

arXiv:2510.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.

<title>C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression</title>

arXiv:2510.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.

<title>Binary Quadratic Quantization: Beyond First-Order Quantization for Real-Valued Matrix Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18650</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.

arXiv:2510.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle (user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated. The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

<title>Beyond the Pipeline: Analyzing Key Factors in End-to-End Deep Learning for Historical Writer Identification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI), a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles, document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer. These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic, document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system, despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps, with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2510.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

<title>Exploring a Unified Vision-Centric Contrastive Alternatives on Multi-Modal Web Documents</title>

arXiv:2510.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/showlab/VC2L.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods, thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However, despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way, with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project page is available at https://lck666666.github.io/plana3r

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.

arXiv:2510.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive, unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

<title>SEAL: Semantic-Aware Hierarchical Learning for Generalized Category Discovery</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks, including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation, entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<title>Rebellious Student: A Complementary Learning Framework for Background Feature Enhancement in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and (2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xjpp2016/FERS.

<title>ProCLIP: Progressive Vision-Language Alignment via LLM-based Embedder</title>

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

This derivation is based on geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of 98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components: (1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3) To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

<title>DP$^2$O-SR: Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in https://robo-bench.github.io.

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides substantial convenience and has emerged as a thriving research field, yet the coarse spatial resolution inherent to Wi-Fi significantly hinders its ability to distinguish multiple subjects. By exploiting the near-field domination effect, establishing a dedicated sensing link for each subject through their personal Wi-Fi device offers a promising solution for multi-person HAR under native traffic. However, due to the subject-specific characteristics and irregular patterns of near-field signals, HAR neural network models require fine-tuning (FT) for cross-domain adaptation, which becomes particularly challenging with certain categories unavailable. In this paper, we propose WiAnchor, a novel training framework for efficient cross-domain adaptation in the presence of incomplete activity categories. This framework processes Wi-Fi signals embedded with irregular time information in three steps: during pre-training, we enlarge inter-class feature margins to enhance the separability of activities; in the FT stage, we innovate an anchor matching mechanism for cross-domain adaptation, filtering subject-specific interference informed by incomplete activity categories, rather than attempting to extract complete features from them; finally, the recognition of input samples is further improved based on their feature-level similarity with anchors. We construct a comprehensive dataset to thoroughly evaluate WiAnchor, achieving over 90% cross-domain accuracy with absent activity categories.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents unique challenges due to unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, and limited appearance cues inherent to aerial viewpoints. These issues are further exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency, highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented demands for computational power, yet methods for evaluating the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of deployed models remain fragmented. Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it difficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware, software stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a unified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our framework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically measuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and location-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy constraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision models across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like the GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream software stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By systematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers, clarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The accompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates adoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based decisions for sustainable AI deployment.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation serves as a critical component of precision medicine, enabling accurate localization and delineation of pathological regions, such as lesions. However, existing models empirically apply fixed thresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering no statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR). This lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D lesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a risk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that calibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time FNR remains below a target tolerance $\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels. CLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting for each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal prediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical threshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target tolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\alpha$, we then determine the approximate $1-\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the calibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such critical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in the calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while yielding more precise and reliable segmentations. We validate the statistical soundness and predictive performance of CLS on six 3D-LS datasets across five backbone models, and conclude with actionable insights for deploying risk-aware segmentation in clinical practice.

Abstract: We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy) neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii) a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral, multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven, standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

<title>Demystifying Transition Matching: When and Why It Can Beat Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM. The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

<title>A Generalizable Light Transport 3D Embedding for Global Illumination</title>

Abstract: Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains computationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light transport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization, sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from 3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines without explicit ray-traced illumination cues.

<title>DualHash: A Stochastic Primal-Dual Algorithm with Theoretical Guarantee for Deep Hashing</title>

Abstract: Deep hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors into compact binary codes, enabling efficient large-scale retrieval. A fundamental challenge in deep hashing stems from the discrete nature of quantization in generating the codes. W-type regularizations, such as $||z|-1|$, have been proven effective as they encourage variables toward binary values. However, existing methods often directly optimize these regularizations without convergence guarantees. While proximal gradient methods offer a promising solution, the coupling between W-type regularizers and neural network outputs results in composite forms that generally lack closed-form proximal solutions. In this paper, we present a stochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm, referred to as DualHash, that provides rigorous complexity bounds. Using Fenchel duality, we partially transform the nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into the dual space, which results in a proximal operator that admits closed-form solutions. We derive two algorithm instances: a momentum-accelerated version with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ complexity and an improved $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ version using variance reduction. Experiments on three image retrieval databases demonstrate the superior performance of DualHash.

<title>From Competition to Synergy: Unlocking Reinforcement Learning for Subject-Driven Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i) Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW), which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench, comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse, Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels (25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3 prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation. (4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices. We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset. Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB), particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity. Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their integration with 3D spatial data (3D-LLMs) has seen rapid progress, offering unprecedented capabilities for understanding and interacting with physical spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies enabling LLMs to process, understand, and generate 3D data. Highlighting the unique advantages of LLMs, such as in-context learning, step-by-step reasoning, open-vocabulary capabilities, and extensive world knowledge, we underscore their potential to significantly advance spatial comprehension and interaction within embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our investigation spans various 3D data representations, from point clouds to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). It examines their integration with LLMs for tasks such as 3D scene understanding, captioning, question-answering, and dialogue, as well as LLM-based agents for spatial reasoning, planning, and navigation. The paper also includes a brief review of other methods that integrate 3D and language. The meta-analysis presented in this paper reveals significant progress yet underscores the necessity for novel approaches to harness the full potential of 3D-LLMs. Hence, with this paper, we aim to chart a course for future research that explores and expands the capabilities of 3D-LLMs in understanding and interacting with the complex 3D world. To support this survey, we have established a project page where papers related to our topic are organized and listed: https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/Awesome-LLM-3D.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, traditional methods for object ReID directly adopting CNN models trained on the ImageNet dataset usually produce unsatisfactory retrieval performance on colonoscopic datasets due to the large domain gap. Worsely, these solutions typically learn unimodal modal representations on the basis of visual samples, which fails to explore complementary information from other different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Deep Multimodal Collaborative Learning framework named DMCL for polyp re-identification, which can effectively encourage multimodal knowledge collaboration and reinforce generalization capability in medical scenarios. On the basis of it, a dynamic multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the optimized visual-text representations for multimodal fusion via end-to-end training. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the collaborative multimodal fusion strategy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JeremyXSC/DMCL.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction poses a persistent challenge in 3D vision. Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an effective method for this task, offering real-time rendering and high visual fidelity. This approach decomposes a dynamic scene into a static representation in a canonical space and time-varying scene motion. Scene motion is defined as the collective movement of all Gaussian points, and for compactness, existing approaches commonly adopt implicit neural fields or sparse control points. However, these methods predominantly rely on gradient-based optimization for all motion information. Due to the high degree of freedom, they struggle to converge on real-world datasets exhibiting complex motion. To preserve the compactness of motion representation and address convergence challenges, this paper proposes heterogeneous 3D control points, termed \textbf{H3D control points}, whose attributes are obtained using a hybrid strategy combining optical flow back-projection and gradient-based methods. This design decouples directly observable motion components from those that are geometrically occluded. Specifically, components of 3D motion that project onto the image plane are directly acquired via optical flow back projection, while unobservable portions are refined through gradient-based optimization. Experiments on the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deformable 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. Remarkably, our method converges within just 100 iterations and achieves a per-frame processing speed of 2 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU.

Abstract: Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

Abstract: 3D medical image analysis is essential for modern healthcare, yet traditional task-specific models are inadequate due to limited generalizability across diverse clinical scenarios. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, existing MLLMs have limitations in fully leveraging the rich, hierarchical information embedded in 3D medical images. Inspired by clinical practice, where radiologists focus on both 3D spatial structure and 2D planar content, we propose Med-2E3, a 3D medical MLLM that integrates a dual 3D-2D encoder architecture. To aggregate 2D features effectively, we design a Text-Guided Inter-Slice (TG-IS) scoring module, which scores the attention of each 2D slice based on slice contents and task instructions. To the best of our knowledge, Med-2E3 is the first MLLM to integrate both 3D and 2D features for 3D medical image analysis. Experiments on large-scale, open-source 3D medical multimodal datasets demonstrate that TG-IS exhibits task-specific attention distribution and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Facial personalization faces challenges to maintain identity fidelity without disrupting the foundation model's prompt consistency. The mainstream personalization models employ identity embedding to integrate identity information within the attention mechanisms. However, our preliminary findings reveal that identity embeddings compromise the effectiveness of other tokens in the prompt, thereby limiting high prompt consistency and attribute-level controllability. Moreover, by deactivating identity embedding, personalization models still demonstrate the underlying foundation models' ability to control facial attributes precisely. It suggests that such foundation models' knowledge can be leveraged to cure the ill-aligned prompt consistency of personalization models. Building upon these insights, we propose FreeCure, a framework that improves the prompt consistency of personalization models with their latent foundation models' knowledge. First, by setting a dual inference paradigm with/without identity embedding, we identify attributes (e.g., hair, accessories, etc.) for enhancements. Second, we introduce a novel foundation-aware self-attention module, coupled with an inversion-based process to bring well-aligned attribute information to the personalization process. Our approach is training-free, and can effectively enhance a wide array of facial attributes; and it can be seamlessly integrated into existing popular personalization models based on both Stable Diffusion and FLUX. FreeCure has consistently shown significant improvements in prompt consistency across these facial personalization models while maintaining the integrity of their original identity fidelity.

Abstract: Point clouds have gained prominence across numerous applications due to their ability to accurately represent 3D objects and scenes. However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms octree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance in joint geometry and attribute compression.

Abstract: View transformation robustness (VTR) is critical for deep-learning-based multi-view 3D object reconstruction models, which indicates the methods' stability under inputs with various view transformations. However, existing research seldom focused on view transformation robustness in multi-view 3D object reconstruction. One direct way to improve the models' VTR is to produce data with more view transformations and add them to model training. Recent progress on large vision models, particularly Stable Diffusion models, has provided great potential for generating 3D models or synthesizing novel view images with only a single image input. Directly deploying these models at inference consumes heavy computation resources and their robustness to view transformations is not guaranteed either. To fully utilize the power of Stable Diffusion models without extra inference computation burdens, we propose to generate novel views with Stable Diffusion models for better view transformation robustness. Instead of synthesizing random views, we propose a reconstruction error-guided view selection method, which considers the reconstruction errors' spatial distribution of the 3D predictions and chooses the views that could cover the reconstruction errors as much as possible. The methods are trained and tested on sets with large view transformations to validate the 3D reconstruction models' robustness to view transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods and other view transformation robustness comparison methods.

Abstract: Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric technology, widely applied in diverse scenarios. Traditional handcrafted methods for palmprint recognition often fall short in representation capability, as they heavily depend on researchers' prior knowledge. Deep learning (DL) has been introduced to address this limitation, leveraging its remarkable successes across various domains. While existing surveys focus narrowly on specific tasks within palmprint recognition-often grounded in traditional methodologies-there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research exploring DL-based approaches across all facets of palmprint recognition. This paper bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. The paper systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest segmentation, feature extraction, and security/privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, the paper identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research. By consolidating state-of-the-art progress, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling them to stay abreast of cutting-edge technologies and drive innovation in palmprint recognition.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies necessitates the development of robust face forgery detection algorithms. Recent studies have demonstrated that wavelet analysis can enhance the generalization abilities of forgery detectors. Wavelets effectively capture key facial contours, often slender, fine-grained, and globally distributed, that may conceal subtle forgery artifacts imperceptible in the spatial domain. However, current wavelet-based approaches fail to fully exploit the distinctive properties of wavelet data, resulting in sub-optimal feature extraction and limited performance gains. To address this challenge, we introduce WMamba, a novel wavelet-based feature extractor built upon the Mamba architecture. WMamba maximizes the utility of wavelet information through two key innovations. First, we propose Dynamic Contour Convolution (DCConv), which employs specially crafted deformable kernels to adaptively model slender facial contours. Second, by leveraging the Mamba architecture, our method captures long-range spatial relationships with linear complexity. This efficiency allows for the extraction of fine-grained, globally distributed forgery artifacts from small image patches. Extensive experiments show that WMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, highlighting its effectiveness in face forgery detection.

Abstract: Virtual try-on, which aims to seamlessly fit garments onto person images, has recently seen significant progress with diffusion-based models. However, existing methods commonly resort to duplicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, which increases computational overhead and network complexity. In this paper, we propose ITVTON, an efficient framework that leverages the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as its single generator to improve image fidelity. By concatenating garment and person images along the width dimension and incorporating textual descriptions from both, ITVTON effectively captures garment-person interactions while preserving realism. To further reduce computational cost, we restrict training to the attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITVTON surpasses baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, setting a new standard for virtual try-on. Moreover, experiments on 10,257 image pairs from IGPair confirm its robustness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) algorithms typically follow the Imitation Learning (IL) paradigm, which faces challenges such as causal confusion and an open-loop gap. In this work, we propose RAD, a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for end-to-end Autonomous Driving. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards to guide the policy in effectively responding to safety-critical events and understanding real-world causal relationships. To better align with human driving behavior, we incorporate IL into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, particularly exhibiting a 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented in the supplementary material. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/RAD for facilitating future research.

Abstract: Inherent limitations of contemporary machine learning systems in crucial areas -- importantly in continual learning, information reuse, comprehensibility, and integration with deliberate behavior -- are receiving increasing attention. To address these challenges, we introduce a system design, fueled by a novel learning approach conceptually grounded in principles of evolutionary developmental biology, that overcomes key limitations of current methods. Our design comprises three core components: The Modeller, a gradient-free learning mechanism inherently capable of continual learning and structural adaptation; a planner for goal-directed action over learned models; and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that can decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate proof-of-principle operation in a simple test environment. Additionally, we extend our modeling framework to higher-dimensional network-structured spaces, using MNIST for a shape detection task. Our framework shows promise in overcoming multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning systems simultaneously and in an organic manner.

Abstract: 3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis.
  In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.

Abstract: Diffusion-based inverse algorithms have shown remarkable performance across various inverse problems, yet their reliance on numerous denoising steps incurs high computational costs. While recent developments of fast diffusion ODE solvers offer effective acceleration for diffusion sampling without observations, their application in inverse problems remains limited due to the heterogeneous formulations of inverse algorithms and their prevalent use of approximations and heuristics, which often introduce significant errors that undermine the reliability of analytical solvers. In this work, we begin with an analysis of ODE solvers for inverse problems that reveals a linear combination structure of approximations for the inverse trajectory. Building on this insight, we propose a canonical form that unifies a broad class of diffusion-based inverse algorithms and facilitates the design of more generalizable solvers. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy, we propose Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE), a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm conforming to our canonical form. LLE optimizes the combination coefficients to refine current predictions using previous estimates, alleviating the sensitivity of analytical solvers for inverse algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps. Codes for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant of the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called scSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above-mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI , a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing ratio) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of scSplit on 5 public datasets. The source code with pre-trained models is hosted at https://github.com/juglab/scSplit/.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.12 and 1.69 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

Abstract: We present MaskWM, a simple, efficient, and flexible framework for image watermarking. MaskWM has two variants: (1) MaskWM-D, which supports global watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for applications such as tamper detection; (2) MaskWM-ED, which focuses on local watermark embedding and extraction, offering enhanced robustness in small regions to support fine-grined image protection. MaskWM-D builds on the classical encoder-distortion layer-decoder training paradigm. In MaskWM-D, we introduce a simple masking mechanism during the decoding stage that enables both global and local watermark extraction. During training, the decoder is guided by various types of masks applied to watermarked images before extraction, helping it learn to localize watermarks and extract them from the corresponding local areas. MaskWM-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in designated local regions, which improves robustness under regional attacks. Extensive experiments show that MaskWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in global and local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual quality of the watermarked images. In addition, MaskWM is highly efficient and adaptable. It requires only 20 hours of training on a single A6000 GPU, achieving 15x computational efficiency compared to WAM. By simply adjusting the distortion layer, MaskWM can be quickly fine-tuned to meet varying robustness requirements.

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Abstract: Morphometric measures derived from spinal cord segmentations can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in neurological diseases and injuries affecting the spinal cord. While robust, automatic segmentation methods to a wide variety of contrasts and pathologies have been developed over the past few years, whether their predictions are stable as the model is updated using new datasets has not been assessed. This is particularly important for deriving normative values from healthy participants. In this study, we present a spinal cord segmentation model trained on a multisite $(n=75)$ dataset, including 9 different MRI contrasts and several spinal cord pathologies. We also introduce a lifelong learning framework to automatically monitor the morphometric drift as the model is updated using additional datasets. The framework is triggered by an automatic GitHub Actions workflow every time a new model is created, recording the morphometric values derived from the model's predictions over time. As a real-world application of the proposed framework, we employed the spinal cord segmentation model to update a recently-introduced normative database of healthy participants containing commonly used measures of spinal cord morphometry. Results showed that: (i) our model outperforms previous versions and pathology-specific models on challenging lumbar spinal cord cases, achieving an average Dice score of $0.95 \pm 0.03$; (ii) the automatic workflow for monitoring morphometric drift provides a quick feedback loop for developing future segmentation models; and (iii) the scaling factor required to update the database of morphometric measures is nearly constant among slices across the given vertebral levels, showing minimum drift between the current and previous versions of the model monitored by the framework. The code and model are open-source and accessible via Spinal Cord Toolbox v7.0.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of reasoning-induced computation has not been thoroughly explored in the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task depending critically on visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple quality scores for each image. These estimates are used to compute comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions, and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like super-resolution and image generation.

Abstract: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.

Abstract: We introduce CoLoRA (Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CoLoRA extends LoRA to convolutional layers by decomposing kernel updates into lightweight depthwise and pointwise components.This design reduces the number of trainable parameters to 0.2 compared to conventional fine-tuning, preserves the original model size, and allows merging updates into the pretrained weights after each epoch, keeping inference complexity unchanged. On OCTMNISTv2, CoLoRA applied to VGG16 and ResNet50 achieves up to 1 percent accuracy and 0.013 AUC improvements over strong baselines (Vision Transformers, state-space, and Kolmogorov Arnold models) while reducing per-epoch training time by nearly 20 percent. Results indicate that CoLoRA provides a stable and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for medical image classification.

Abstract: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel and unified framework for video fusion that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality, well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/Junjue-Wang/DisasterM3.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.

Abstract: While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.00% accuracy on space-level tasks and 31.46% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model, with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations-often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands demonstrate that RODS maintains comparable image quality and preserves generation diversity. More importantly, it improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while avoiding the introduction of new artifacts. We release our code at https://github.com/Yiqi-Verna-Tian/RODS.

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016 dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/RandSF.Q.

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4% in terms of precision, and 86.4% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5% and 92.7%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task. GeoArena has been open-sourced to support future research.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However, existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise \textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt (\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism. Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

<title>Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models. Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies, which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First, current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models. Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes, sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V generators are from world models.

Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in deep learning for medical image segmentation, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models. However, CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose RWKV-UNet, a novel model that integrates the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) structure into the U-Net architecture. This integration enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and to improve contextual understanding, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. We build a strong encoder with developed Global-Local Spatial Perception (GLSP) blocks combining CNNs and RWKVs. We also propose a Cross-Channel Mix (CCM) module to improve skip connections with multi-scale feature fusion, achieving global channel information integration. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that the RWKV-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various types of medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, smaller variants, RWKV-UNet-S and RWKV-UNet-T, balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

Abstract: While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in natural image synthesis, their core strengths - creativity and realism - can be detrimental in medical applications, where accuracy and fidelity are paramount. These models instead risk introducing hallucinations and replication of unwanted acquisition noise. Here, we propose YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that conventional diffusion sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging. As this effectively approximates the DM's expected value, we term this Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression sampling YODA, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse multi-modal datasets - including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more efficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full diffusion sampling even with ExpA. Our results reveal that iterative refinement solely enhances perceptual realism without benefiting information translation, which we confirm in relevant downstream tasks. YODA outperforms eight state-of-the-art DMs and GANs and challenges the presumed superiority of DMs and GANs over computationally cheap regression models for high-quality MIT. Furthermore, we show that YODA-translated images are interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces (left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders, which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Learning-to-Detect-51CB.

<title>Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Summary: <br />
The study compares the cost-effectiveness of supervised YOLO and zero-shot vision-language models Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT-4 for object detection. Supervised YOLO achieves higher accuracy (91.2%) compared to Gemini (68.5%) and GPT-4 (71.3%) on standard categories. However, the annotation expense for a 100-category system is $10,800, making the accuracy advantage of YOLO worthwhile only beyond 55 million inferences. For diverse product categories, Gemini and GPT-4 outperform supervised YOLO, achieving 52.3% and 55.1% accuracy, respectively. Gemini has the lowest cost-per-correct-detection at $0.00050, followed by GPT-4 at $0.00067, while YOLO is significantly higher at $0.143. The choice of architecture depends on factors such as inference volume, category stability, budget, and accuracy requirements, as illustrated by decision frameworks provided in the study. <div>

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on costly manual annotation. We present the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised YOLO and zero-shot vision-language models (Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT-4). Evaluated on 5,000 stratified COCO images and 500 diverse product images, combined with Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we derive break-even thresholds for architecture selection. Results show supervised YOLO attains 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for Gemini and 71.3% for GPT-4 on standard categories; the annotation expense for a 100-category system is $10,800, and the accuracy advantage only pays off beyond 55 million inferences (151,000 images/day for one year). On diverse product categories Gemini achieves 52.3% and GPT-4 55.1%, while supervised YOLO cannot detect untrained classes. Cost-per-correct-detection favors Gemini ($0.00050) and GPT-4 ($0.00067) over YOLO ($0.143) at 100,000 inferences. We provide decision frameworks showing that optimal architecture choice depends on inference volume, category stability, budget, and accuracy requirements.

Summary:
In this work, the authors address the challenge of accurately modeling reflections in 2D images for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. They propose a multi-view approach that focuses on consistent material inference and physically-based environment modeling. By enforcing 2D Gaussians to generate multi-view consistent material maps and tracking photometric variations across views, they are able to identify highly reflective regions and improve reflection strength terms. Additionally, they introduce a ray tracing strategy with Gaussian Splatting to handle indirect illumination from inter-object occlusions, enabling realistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experimental results demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis by faithfully recovering both illumination and geometry. <div>

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.

<div> Implicit Bias, Membership Inference Attack, Neural Networks, White-box Attack, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker 

Summary:
ImpMIA introduces a novel approach to Membership Inference Attacks by leveraging the Implicit Bias of neural networks, eliminating the need for auxiliary reference models. The attack, conducted in a white-box setting, utilizes the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples based on gradient reconstruction of the model parameters. By removing the assumptions of knowing training hyperparameters, distribution of non-training samples, and the fraction of training data in the evaluation set, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black-box and white-box attacks in realistic scenarios where only model weights and a superset of training data are accessible. <div>
arXiv:2510.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are partially or entirely missing.

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city wide deployments.

Summary: <br /><br />
This paper introduces a novel paradigm for Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) called IAD-GPT, which combines rich text semantics with image-level and pixel-level information. The model uses an Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to create detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects, activating detection and segmentation functions in pre-trained visual-language models like CLIP. The Text-Guided Enhancer enhances the visual grounding ability of large language models by allowing image features to interact with text prompts, focusing on specific aspects of visual data for accurate anomaly interpretation. Additionally, a Multi-Mask Fusion module incorporates mask knowledge to improve the perception of pixel-level anomalies. Experimental results on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks. The code for this research is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2510.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT), structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience. Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students) each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$ s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm 58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s (FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P < .001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation Framework (IFEF) for analyzing and mitigating biases in image classification models trained on imbalanced datasets. By combining fairness metrics and interpretability tools, the framework systematically identifies bias patterns in model predictions. The proposed Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA) strategy adapts data augmentation based on subgroup distribution statistics, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24 percentage points. Additionally, fairness metric disparities are reduced by 35%. Statistical analysis across multiple runs confirms the significance of these improvements (p < 0.05). The methodology provides a replicable approach for addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24 percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%. Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

<div> Keywords: Quantization, Neural Networks, Shift Bit Quantization, Activation Quantization, Image Classification

Summary:
This paper introduces a differentiable approach to quantization of neural networks, addressing the limitations of previous non-differentiable methods. It also proves convergence to optimal neural networks in this quantization process. The shift bit quantization method presented allows for variable bit quantization, including weight and activation quantization, which previous methods struggled with. Testing on the ImageNet dataset and ResNet18 model showed that the proposed method achieved comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches in both weight and activation quantization. The training process required only 15 epochs, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements while maintaining high accuracy. The method also showcased the ability to handle logarithmic quantization values of the form $2^n$, providing a more robust quantization approach. Overall, this work presents a novel, differentiable quantization method that enhances the learning capability of neural networks while achieving high performance in image classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection, however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline, respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33% compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency, offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable infrastructure management.

<div> object detection, uncertainty reduction, autonomous driving, neural networks, perception

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces ObjectTransforms, a technique aimed at reducing uncertainty in vision-based object detection for autonomous driving applications. ObjectTransforms applies color space perturbations during training to enhance robustness to lighting and color variations. It also utilizes diffusion models to generate diverse pedestrian instances, improving model generalization. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects, allowing for real-time quantification of predictive uncertainty. This uncertainty signal is leveraged to filter out false positives and recover false negatives, ultimately enhancing the precision-recall curve. Experimental results using YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate significant accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction for all object classes. ObjectTransforms effectively predicts higher uncertainty values for false positives compared to true positives, showcasing its potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool for uncertainty reduction in vision-based perception. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.

Summary: 
Our study introduces a novel approach for transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations like images or text. Existing methods struggle with significant geometry differences between input and appearance objects. Instead of directly applying a 3D generative model, we propose a training-free method inspired by universal guidance. By utilizing pretrained rectified flow models and periodically adding guidance in the form of differentiable loss functions, we successfully transfer texture and geometric details to 3D assets, surpassing baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. We demonstrate that traditional metrics are inadequate for evaluating the task, and introduce a GPT-based system for objective ranking of outputs. Our user study further affirms the robust and human-like assessment of appearance transfer quality. The proposed method is versatile and can be extended to various diffusion models and guidance functions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.

Summary: 
DuetMatch is a novel semi-supervised framework for medical image segmentation that addresses the challenges of optimizing the entire network concurrently. It utilizes a dual-branch approach with asynchronous optimization, allowing each branch to focus on either the encoder or decoder independently. The framework introduces Decoupled Dropout Perturbation to enhance consistency in noisy conditions and Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance to increase model diversity through pseudo-label exchange. Additionally, Consistency Matching is employed to refine labels using stable predictions from a frozen teacher model, reducing confirmation bias. Experiments on brain MRI segmentation datasets, such as ISLES2022 and BraTS, demonstrate that DuetMatch outperforms existing methods in various semi-supervised segmentation scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

The study introduces a pipeline for autonomously navigating the C-arm to specific anatomical landmarks using X-ray images. The model predicts 3D displacement vectors towards target landmarks from any initial location on the operating table. To enhance reliability, uncertainties in the predictions are captured and calibrated using conformal prediction, forming 3D confidence regions around the predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic loss with skeletal pose regularization to ensure anatomically plausible outputs. Validation on a synthetic X-ray dataset demonstrates strong localization accuracy and well-calibrated prediction bounds, emphasizing the potential of the pipeline for safe and reliable autonomous C-arm systems.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at https://github.com/AhmadArrabi/C_arm_guidance_APAH

In the study, the authors explore the use of automatic pre-filtering in deep generative models to improve image quality assessment processes. They note that while current technology has made significant advancements in generating high-quality images, traditional photographic methods still outperform them. The manual stage of image quality assessment (IQA) is time-consuming and costly, leading to low yield of usable images. By introducing an automatic pre-filtering stage, the overall quality of images sent for review can be improved, reducing the cost required to obtain high-quality images. The researchers present a formula that estimates cost savings based on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine, demonstrating a significant cost saving of 51.61% in a background inpainting use case using a simple AutoML solution. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason, production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.

Traditional training methods for video models are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully exploit the unique attributes of SSMs, leading to spatio-temporal inflexibility. To address this issue, a flexible training method called StretchySnake is introduced, which samples videos at varying resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This approach enhances the adaptability of SSMs, enabling them to handle videos of different resolutions seamlessly. StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines in action recognition tasks, demonstrating strong adaptability to diverse scenarios and improving performance by up to 28%. This training method provides a simple recipe to make video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across various action recognition scenarios.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.

arXiv:2510.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment. Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture, \textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a \textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}. Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for early detection of Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC), the most common type of head and neck cancer. A CNN was trained on a dataset of benign and malignant tumors to recognize OCSCC with high precision and recall. The study also involved designing hardware for capturing detailed images to determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. The testing dataset included images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative samples at varying resolutions, revealing that higher resolution images led to more accurate predictions. An application was developed to streamline the testing process and provide open access to the CNN. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of CNNs in aiding the early detection of OCSCC through precise image analysis and pattern recognition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique, accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world scenarios with promising advantages.

<div> Keywords: Video anomaly detection, Vision-Language Models, Real-time deployment, Motion mask prompting, Rule-based deviation detection

Summary:
Cerberus is a two-stage cascaded system developed for real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD). It addresses the issue of high computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance seen in current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by combining offline learning of normal behavioral rules with lightweight filtering and fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. Cerberus introduces two key innovations: motion mask prompting, which directs the VLM's attention to motion-relevant regions, and rule-based deviation detection, which identifies anomalies based on deviations from learned norms. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Cerberus achieves an average frame rate of 57.68 fps, a significant speedup of 151.79 times on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, while maintaining an accuracy level of 97.2%. These results position Cerberus as a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analytics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a 151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time video analytics.

Summary: 
OpenLVLM-MIA introduces a new benchmark for evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). Previous studies have shown high attack success rates, mainly due to detecting dataset bias instead of true membership status. The benchmark consists of 6,000 images with balanced member and non-member distributions and ground-truth membership labels. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art MIA methods perform at random chance under unbiased conditions. By providing a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA elucidates the limitations of current MIA research on LVLMs and lays the groundwork for developing more robust privacy-preserving techniques.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.

It focuses on precise stroke attribute transfer, including line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity, while maintaining semantic structure and content fidelity. The framework incorporates cross-image stroke attention within self-attention layers to establish semantic correspondences for accurate stroke attribute transfer. It also utilizes adaptive contrast enhancement and semantic-focused attention to preserve content and emphasize foreground elements.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity, while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in expressive stroke control and semantic coherence.

This paper examines the scaling laws for deepfake detection by analyzing the performance of models in relation to the number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images. The study introduces ScaleDF, the largest dataset in the field, comprising over 5.8 million real images from 51 domains and 8.8 million fake images from 102 deepfake methods. The research reveals power-law scaling similar to large language models, with detection error decreasing predictably as the number of domains or methods increases. This insight enables forecasting performance targets and promotes a data-centric approach to combat evolving deepfake technology. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of pre-training and data augmentations on deepfake detection under scaling, while also highlighting the limitations of scaling in this context. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images. Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than 8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as well as the limitations of scaling itself.

<div> Diffusion models, Scale-DiT, ultra-high-resolution, hierarchical local attention, global guidance <br />
Summary: Scale-DiT is a new diffusion framework for ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation, addressing the limitations of current models. It introduces hierarchical local attention and low-resolution global guidance to enable efficient and semantically coherent image synthesis at resolutions up to 4K. By dividing high-resolution latents into local windows and incorporating global semantics with scaled positional anchors, Scale-DiT achieves faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention models. Its design, including a lightweight LoRA adaptation, token sequence repermutation, and fused-kernel implementation, allows for GPU-friendly operation. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in global coherence and fine detail, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods without the need for high-resolution training data. This hierarchical approach shows promise for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear, while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$ resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons, Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training. Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Summary: 
DiffusionX is a new framework designed to improve the efficiency of image generation processes that utilize diffusion models. By combining a lightweight on-device model with a high-capacity cloud model, DiffusionX enables rapid preview image generation followed by final refinements in the cloud. A dynamic noise level predictor helps optimize computation load, striking a balance between latency and cloud workload. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffusionX reduces generation time by 15.8% compared to Stable Diffusion v1.5 while maintaining high image quality. It is also slightly slower than Tiny-SD but offers significantly improved image quality. This efficient and scalable framework minimizes overhead and allows for iterative, prompt-based image generation with minimal latency.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive, and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5, while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Summary: <br />
The TokenAR framework addresses the reference identity confusion problem in conditional image generation by implementing a token-level enhancement mechanism. It includes Token Index Embedding for better token representation, Instruct Token Injection for injecting detailed priors, and identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) for guiding token representations. The framework enhances existing AR-based methods, maintaining identity consistency and high-quality background reconstruction. The InstructAR Dataset, a large-scale dataset for multi-reference image generation, is introduced for training and evaluation. Results from comprehensive experiments show that the TokenAR approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models in multiple reference image generation. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available on Github. <div>
arXiv:2510.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3). The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token representations toward independently representing the features of each identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation, enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and datasets will be made publicly.

<div> reinforcement learning, multimodal language model, vision encoder, downstream tasks, visual representations 
Summary: 
Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on the vision encoder for image perception. A shift from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigms has shown advantages in vision-related benchmarks. A comprehensive analysis of vision encoder impact on MLLMs reveals that RL training produces stronger and more precise visual representations compared to SFT, enhancing the MLLM's capability. This insight leads to the development of a new training method, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT), which significantly improves the performance of MLLMs with minimal computational cost. PIVOT-trained vision encoders outperform larger, heavily trained counterparts, offering a more efficient approach to enhancing vision backbones for MLLMs. The study provides valuable insights into the impact of training strategies on MLLM performance and offers a promising direction for future research in this field. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining.

- GradNorm is a novel gradient-based framework that measures noun positiveness using back-propagated gradients.

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP; however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework, termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself. Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Social manufacturing, mass individualization, anomaly detection, dataset, quality control

Summary:<br /><br />Social manufacturing involves community collaboration and scattered resources to achieve mass individualization in industry. However, ensuring quality control, especially defect detection, poses significant challenges due to customized configurations, fragmented production orders, and varying imaging environments. To address the lack of real-world data and tailored algorithms, the Mass Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset is introduced. MIRAD is the first benchmark specifically designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing, capturing diverse individualized products, data from multiple manufacturing sites, and imaging heterogeneity. Evaluation of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on MIRAD reveals a performance drop compared to conventional benchmarks, emphasizing the complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. MIRAD serves as a realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions crucial for the evolving Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes. <div>

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control, particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second, production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing, MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/wu33learn/MIRAD.

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale, annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmyMAPSTGrIy2sTnz0-TMw08ZagTimRulbAQcWdaPwDy187A/viewform?usp=dialog).

Summary: <br />
Learning 3D parametric shape models is essential in vision and graphics for a variety of applications, but current approaches lack equally expressive models for plant species. This work introduces Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that efficiently encodes plant morphology, including topology, shape, articulation, and deformation. Unlike existing models, Demeter can handle varying shape topology across different plant species and captures three main sources of shape variation: articulation, subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To enhance crop plant modeling, a large-scale dataset from a soybean farm was collected as a testbed. Experimental results demonstrate that Demeter can effectively synthesize shapes, reconstruct structures, and simulate biophysical processes, showcasing its potential in advancing plant modeling research.$rows numRows=5 modelNames=61acc969c656466391bd72f89152cfec <div>

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction, generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape, articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation, subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and data is available at https://tianhang-cheng.github.io/Demeter/.

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Summary: 
The paper introduces REALM, a novel MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without extensive 3D-specific post-training. REALM performs segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, utilizing their ability to render photorealistic novel views for MLLM comprehension. A Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy is proposed to address sensitivity to viewpoint selection, with multiple global views used for coarse-level localization and close-up novel views for fine-grained local segmentation. REALM achieves impressive performance in interpreting explicit and implicit instructions across various benchmarks, including LERF, 3D-OVS, and REALM3D. The framework supports a range of 3D interaction tasks such as object removal, replacement, and style transfer, showcasing its practical utility and versatility. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of REALM in bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces SSL4RL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning tasks with reinforcement learning to improve vision-language models. By reformulating SSL objectives into automatic reward signals, the framework eliminates the need for human feedback. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements in vision-centric and vision-language reasoning tasks, as well as in graph learning. Key factors influencing the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks are identified, including task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain. The framework offers a versatile and effective method for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives. <div>
arXiv:2510.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Summary:<br />
Local features play a crucial role in applications like SLAM and Structure-from-Motion, with points and lines being complementary features. Traditional approaches treated point and line matching as separate tasks, but the GlueStick model proposed a joint matching method. However, its heavy architecture limited real-time and edge device deployment. To address this, LightGlueStick was developed, a lightweight matcher for points and line segments. This model introduces Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP) to enable efficient communication between network nodes and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The code for LightGlueStick is publicly available on GitHub, facilitating further research and applications in the field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity, the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/aubingazhib/LightGlueStick.

<div> deepfake video detection, explainable reasoning, multimodal, reasoning framework, ER-FF++set 

Summary:
The paper introduces the Explainable Deepfake Video Detection (EDVD) task to address the challenges of detecting deepfake videos with transparency and capability to handle evolving forgery techniques. The proposed EDVD-LLaMA framework utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract global and local deepfake features and a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism for pixel-level video localization using facial feature data as constraints. An Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set) is created for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EDVD-LLaMA outperforms previous methods in detection accuracy and explainability, handling cross-forgery methods and datasets. The framework provides traceable reasoning processes, accurate detection results, and trustworthy explanations, making it a superior solution for deepfake video detection. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

arXiv:2510.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) focuses on fine-grained action recognition guided by natural language descriptions for a specific person. The RefAVA++ dataset, with over 2.9 million frames and 75.1k annotated persons, is introduced and benchmarked against baselines and models like RefAtomNet. While RefAtomNet outperforms baselines with agent attention, it struggles with cross-modal alignment. To address this, RefAtomNet++ is introduced with a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism and multi-trajectory Mamba modeling. This framework enhances cross-modal token aggregation through dynamic trajectory selection and semantic-aligned cross-attention, leading to state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are publicly available for further research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Summary:
This paper introduces an improved loss function for detecting rotated objects in computer vision applications. Traditional object detection frameworks are limited in capturing orientation variations, leading to underperformance in scenarios involving rotated objects. The proposed method leverages Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. An anisotropic Gaussian representation is used to address issues with isotropic variance in square-like objects. The rotation-invariant loss function effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects, leading to significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods when integrated into deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors. The approach has the potential to establish a new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for applications requiring precise and reliable object localization regardless of orientation.

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive. Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning.

<div> Keywords: mitochondria segmentation, weakly supervised domain adaptation, multitask learning, instance-aware pseudo-label, electron microscopy images<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a weakly supervised domain adaptation method for efficient mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy images. It makes use of sparse point labels on the target domain, minimizing annotation effort. A multitask learning framework is employed for segmentation and center detection, along with a cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused contrastive learning. The method leverages incomplete point annotations by introducing segmentation self-training with instance-aware pseudo-label selection. Comprehensive validations show superior performance compared to existing unsupervised and weakly supervised domain adaptation techniques, narrowing the gap with supervised methods. Significant improvements are achieved over traditional UDA methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA) that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL) selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Summary:<br />
This work focuses on developing a foresighted agent for goal-oriented Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks. Existing methods often overlook future implications and long-term outcomes of actions. The proposed method utilizes Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory data to learn general knowledge about indoor scenes. A Q-feature is generated for each candidate action, describing potential future information after taking the action. A cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce action scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, combined with historical scores, enable an A*-style searching strategy to explore regions more likely to lead to the destination. Experimental results on goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The paper introduces the HGC-Avatar framework, a Hierarchical Gaussian Compression method designed for efficient transmission and high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. The framework disentangles Gaussian representation into structural and motion layers, enabling layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and diverse input rendering.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast, photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission, the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual quality and compression efficiency.

Summary: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly used in scientific research, but their ability to understand and reason over the complexity of papers is uncertain. To address this challenge, the PRISMM-Bench benchmark is introduced, based on real inconsistencies flagged by reviewers in scientific papers. The benchmark includes tasks such as identifying, remedying, and matching inconsistencies across different modalities. Additionally, a structured JSON-based answer representation is introduced to reduce linguistic biases in evaluation. The study evaluates 21 LMMs, revealing low performance in multimodal scientific reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the need for improved models to assist in scientific research effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces OOS-DSD, a deep learning-based method for out-of-stock (OOS) detection in retail. OOS-DSD extends YOLOv8 with additional branches for simultaneous OOS detection, product segmentation, and scene depth estimation. It utilizes ground truth data for OOS detection and product segmentation, while training the depth estimation branch using pseudo-labeled annotations from Depth Anything V2. A depth normalization procedure is proposed to enhance training stability. Experimental results show OOS-DSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 1.8% in mean average precision (mAP). Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of auxiliary learning and depth normalization, with the former improving mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%. <div>

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular, we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore, since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth, we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach for image categorization and retrieval using a graph attention network (GAT) based autoencoder. The method is representative-centric, focusing on representative models constructed for images and image categories. By utilizing a graph where nodes represent images and edges capture similarity relationships, GAT is able to highlight essential features and relationships between images, allowing the autoencoder to create context-aware latent representations. Category representatives are obtained from these embeddings, enabling efficient categorization of query images by comparing their representatives to category representatives. This approach has been shown to be effective in experiments when compared to standard feature-based techniques, highlighting the potential of leveraging GAT autoencoders for image categorization and retrieval tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval process via the representative models we construct for the images and image categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, compositional reasoning, contrastive learning, reconstruction, alignment

Summary:
The paper introduces the REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ) method to enhance compositional reasoning in vision-language models. READ adds token-level reconstruction and sentence-level alignment objectives to standard contrastive learning, addressing the limitation of text encoders focusing on individual words. By applying READ to the pre-trained CLIP model, READ-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on compositional reasoning benchmarks, surpassing traditional fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, READ improves performance on existing CLIP variants like NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP as well. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the reconstruction objective helps the encoder capture relationships between words, while the alignment objective ensures consistent representations for paraphrased sentences. This novel approach provides complementary benefits and significantly enhances the ability of vision-language models to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.

<title>Watch Where You Move: Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation for Gait Recognition</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.

<title>SHIELD: Suppressing Hallucinations In LVLM Encoders via Bias and Vulnerability Defense</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks. However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be released.

arXiv:2510.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks, that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving 100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by 12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however, interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance, scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of 14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments, demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns - derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484 tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models, emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially reducing the token count of the scene graph content.

<title>Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

<title>HYDRA: HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Algorithm for high channel hyperspectral camera applications</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding, remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases. Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising. These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity. Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

<title>Connecting Domains and Contrasting Samples: A Ladder for Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence. Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

arXiv:2510.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

<title>UKANFormer: Noise-Robust Semantic Segmentation for Coral Reef Mapping via a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Transformer Hybrid</title>

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans) block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated bibliography at https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/AwesomeWorldModels.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult. Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score. Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision, where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency. However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure. Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned results. Code is available at: https://github.com/thuyvuphuong/Region-in-Context.git

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and LineMod datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images, consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly available for academic

<title>ReefNet: A Large scale, Taxonomically Enriched Dataset and Benchmark for Hard Coral Classification</title>

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.

<title>Robust Cross-Domain Adaptation in Texture Features Transferring for Wood Chip Moisture Content Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16832</link>

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods, including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore, there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

<title>From Mannequin to Human: A Pose-Aware and Identity-Preserving Video Generation Framework for Lifelike Clothing Display</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins. We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular, M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising. Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>2DGS-R: Revisiting the Normal Consistency Regularization in 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16837</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance, leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction accuracy.

<title>ArmFormer: Lightweight Transformer Architecture for Real-Time Multi-Class Weapon Segmentation and Classification</title>

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios. This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in distributed security infrastructure.

<title>BARL: Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label Spaces for Semi-Supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16863</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

<title>Registration is a Powerful Rotation-Invariance Learner for 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16865</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However, current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning. This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and generalizability.

<title>Uncovering Brain-Like Hierarchical Patterns in Vision-Language Models through fMRI-Based Neural Encoding</title>

arXiv:2510.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks (including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images. However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely, Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance, highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image generation.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/UniWorld-V2.

<title>Contrail-to-Flight Attribution Using Ground Visible Cameras and Flight Surveillance Data</title>

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2 emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS) dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer, DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5 achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and 92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

arXiv:2510.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models, FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities. To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks. Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation, efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs, thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video. We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities, including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID, an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

<title>Where, Not What: Compelling Video LLMs to Learn Geometric Causality for 3D-Grounding</title>

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias" that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization, largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism. Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness, particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures. Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably, matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving properties of our synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models (3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38 dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71), radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to objective functions have been developed to further improve performance. Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance. Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon contemporary results

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight, trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck. Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation strategies for diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs. FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF) to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection), FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50 on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However, even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene. By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding, i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors. Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light" (specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content verification.

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input. Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE (KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their kinematic properties.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them, we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings. Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%, whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models. Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

<title>Generation then Reconstruction: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Two-Stage Sampling</title>

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding, followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens. Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover, observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1), substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in https://github.com/feihongyan1/GtR.

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD) between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition.

<title>Capturing Head Avatar with Hand Contacts from a Monocular Video</title>

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR. However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work, we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand. Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations, making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore, inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone. Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

<title>HIDISC: A Hyperbolic Framework for Domain Generalization with Generalized Category Discovery</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17188</link>

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories, without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

<title>ZSPAPrune: Zero-Shot Prompt-Aware Token Pruning for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.

<title>From Pixels to People: Satellite-Based Mapping and Quantification of Riverbank Erosion and Lost Villages in Bangladesh</title>

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

<title>Round Outcome Prediction in VALORANT Using Tactical Features from Video Analysis</title>

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information, such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy, especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself. This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

<title>EndoCIL: A Class-Incremental Learning Framework for Endoscopic Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17200</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis, showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<title>Optimizing DINOv2 with Registers for Face Anti-Spoofing</title>

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user, potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop: Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

arXiv:2510.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs, \textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a \textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks; (2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose \emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/VisiPruner.

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval (SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging video temporal grounding scenarios.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency, and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA) architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability, complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis. SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone (EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks, allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved surgical outcomes.

arXiv:2510.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures, and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However, evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance. Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost. Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense degradation. Code is available at https://github.com/EldercatSAM/SSL-Degradation.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating \textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities, focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset and code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LongInsightBench-910F/.

arXiv:2510.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically, when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack. However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over 64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against adversarial clothes.

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality assessments.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit, or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish animals.

<title>Exploring The Missing Semantics In Event Modality</title>

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction (E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes, ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically, Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF) block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder. Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks. The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth, edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments. Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality in spatial perception tasks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries. However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

<title>Beyond Real Faces: Synthetic Datasets Can Achieve Reliable Recognition Performance without Privacy Compromise</title>

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma: achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and 94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative alternative for facial recognition research.

<title>Facial Expression-based Parkinson's Disease Severity Diagnosis via Feature Fusion and Adaptive Class Balancing</title>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However, current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover, most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion. Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

<title>Closed-Loop Transfer for Weakly-supervised Affordance Grounding</title>

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human body.

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall. To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and stable management.

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry, and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density, repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003 (correct matches).

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full pipelines.

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain, which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net) for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/guanqiyuan/CST-Net.

<title>Initialize to Generalize: A Stronger Initialization Pipeline for Sparse-View 3DGS</title>

arXiv:2510.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints (regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i) frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points, compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii) point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a stronger initialization strategy.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency.

arXiv:2510.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available. We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations. First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry; second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap to fully supervised models.

<title>Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media, surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital. Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1 scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video summarization.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in \href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}{our webpage}.

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up. Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations.

<title>WP-CrackNet: A Collaborative Adversarial Learning Framework for End-to-End Weakly-Supervised Road Crack Detection</title>

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies. Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints, enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods, significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

<title>PAGE-4D: Disentangled Pose and Geometry Estimation for 4D Perception</title>

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets, these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks: accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation, monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection, underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring, camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module (CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning, effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands, improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However, existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft, a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure. However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

<title>One Dinomaly2 Detect Them All: A Unified Framework for Full-Spectrum Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17611</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17611</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts. Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD, which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities (2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class, inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial, biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented 99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and 97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design, computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection applications.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

<title>Self-supervised Pre-training for Mapping of Archaeological Stone Wall in Historic Landscapes Using High-Resolution DEM Derivatives</title>

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1) visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains 63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich environments with scarce annotations.

<title>Frugal Federated Learning for Violence Detection: A Comparison of LoRA-Tuned VLMs and Personalized CNNs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact 3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy usage under realistic non-IID settings.
  Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment.
  To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics.
  These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.

arXiv:2510.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce 4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread. The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate 4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex scenes.

<title>PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge. Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT: Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or labels.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images; however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in prior work.

<title>Automatic Classification of Circulating Blood Cell Clusters based on Multi-channel Flow Cytometry Imaging</title>

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters, revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT). Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware 3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness, increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes, with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation while remaining lightweight.

<title>Towards Explainable Skin Cancer Classification: A Dual-Network Attention Model with Lesion Segmentation and Clinical Metadata Fusion</title>

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.

<title>SparseVILA: Decoupling Visual Sparsity for Efficient VLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

<title>UltraCUA: A Foundation Model for Computer Use Agents with Hybrid Action</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17790</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions (click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks. While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers, tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical, reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

<title>ConsistEdit: Highly Consistent and Precise Training-free Visual Editing</title>

arXiv:2510.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing. Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

<title>ISO/IEC-Compliant Match-on-Card Face Verification with Short Binary Templates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical match-on-card design for face verification in which compact 64/128-bit templates are produced off-card by PCA-ITQ and compared on-card via constant-time Hamming distance. We specify ISO/IEC 7816-4 and 14443-4 command APDUs with fixed-length payloads and decision-only status words (no score leakage), together with a minimal per-identity EEPROM map. Using real binary codes from a CelebA working set (55 identities, 412 images), we (i) derive operating thresholds from ROC/DET, (ii) replay enroll->verify transactions at those thresholds, and (iii) bound end-to-end time by pure link latency plus a small constant on-card budget. Even at the slowest contact rate (9.6 kbps), total verification time is 43.9 ms (64 b) and 52.3 ms (128 b); at 38.4 kbps both are <14 ms. At FAR = 1%, both code lengths reach TPR = 0.836, while 128 b lowers EER relative to 64 b. An optional +6 B helper (targeted symbol-level parity over empirically unstable bits) is latency-negligible. Overall, short binary templates, fixed-payload decision-only APDUs, and constant-time matching satisfy ISO/IEC transport constraints with wide timing margin and align with ISO/IEC 24745 privacy goals. Limitations: single-dataset evaluation and design-level (pre-hardware) timing; we outline AgeDB/CFP-FP and on-card microbenchmarks as next steps.

Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Lung cancer, a malignancy originating in lung tissues, is commonly diagnosed and classified using medical imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT). Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning methods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer classification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical adoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification, distinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a novel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved multi-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT images. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, lung tissue images were classified into three distinct classes, two of which denote malignancy and one benign. Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the LC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200 images, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images. Through the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was recorded. This represents a notable enhancement over the performance of prior models on the same dataset.

<title>Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.

<title>Beyond Fixed Anchors: Precisely Erasing Concepts with Sibling Exclusive Counterparts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics, averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, though exhibiting remarkable creativity in image generation, can be exploited to produce unsafe images. Existing safety measures, e.g., content moderation or model alignment, fail in the presence of white-box adversaries who know and can adjust model parameters, e.g., by fine-tuning. This paper presents a novel defensive framework, named Patronus, which equips T2I models with holistic protection to defend against white-box adversaries. Specifically, we design an internal moderator that decodes unsafe input features into zero vectors while ensuring the decoding performance of benign input features. Furthermore, we strengthen the model alignment with a carefully designed non-fine-tunable learning mechanism, ensuring the T2I model will not be compromised by malicious fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the intactness of the performance on safe content generation and the effectiveness of rejecting unsafe content generation. Results also confirm the resilience of Patronus against various fine-tuning attacks by white-box adversaries.

Abstract: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field. An isosurface is a piecewise linear approximation of a level set $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for some $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ built from some regular grid sampling of $f$. Isosurfaces constructed from scanned data such as CT scans or MRIs often contain extremely small components that distract from the visualization and do not form part of any geometric model produced from the data. Simple prefiltering of the data can remove such small components while having no effect on the large components that form the body of the visualization. We present experimental results on such filtering.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

We address this challenge using a deep learning approach but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology: positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

<title>Unlocking Off-the-Grid Sparse Recovery with Unlimited Sensing: Simultaneous Super-Resolution in Time and Amplitude</title>

Abstract: The recovery of Dirac impulses, or spikes, from filtered measurements is a classical problem in signal processing. As the spikes lie in the continuous domain while measurements are discrete, this task is known as super-resolution or off-the-grid sparse recovery. Despite significant theoretical and algorithmic advances over the past decade, these developments often overlook critical challenges at the analog-digital interface. In particular, when spikes exhibit strong-weak amplitude disparity, conventional digital acquisition may result in clipping of strong components or loss of weak ones beneath the quantization noise floor. This motivates a broader perspective: super-resolution must simultaneously resolve both amplitude and temporal structure. Under a fixed bit budget, such information loss is unavoidable. In contrast, the emerging theory and practice of the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) demonstrate that these fundamental limitations can be overcome. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that modulo encoding within USF enables digital super-resolution by enhancing measurement precision, thereby unlocking temporal super-resolution beyond conventional limits. We develop new theoretical results that extend to non-bandlimited kernels commonly encountered in practice and introduce a robust algorithm for off-the-grid sparse recovery. To demonstrate practical impact, we instantiate our framework in the context of time-of-flight imaging. Both numerical simulations and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under low-bit quantization, enabling super-resolution in amplitude and time.

Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.

<title>Shape-aware Inertial Poser: Motion Tracking for Humans with Diverse Shapes Using Sparse Inertial Sensors</title>

Abstract: Human motion capture with sparse inertial sensors has gained significant attention recently. However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a template adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges when generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a child). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration caused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware Inertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in sparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor measurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their joint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the IMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body model, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can easily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of the template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map the joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware physical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject. Furthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first inertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the shape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate the effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset containing individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10 children and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total of 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse body shapes. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yinlu5942/SAIP.

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size). From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d. Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its application to underdetermined inverse problems.

Abstract: Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal continual learning, aiming to learn new tasks sequentially in multi-modal settings while preserving performance on previously learned ones. However, existing methods mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks; 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed, allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal continual learning methods.

<title>From Preferences to Prejudice: The Role of Alignment Tuning in Shaping Social Bias in Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

<title>Latent Spaces Beyond Synthesis: From GANs to Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

<title>MILES: Modality-Informed Learning Rate Scheduler for Balancing Multimodal Learning</title>

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources, referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance, hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal learning on improving model performance.

Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.

Abstract: The growing negative impact of the visibility of satellites in the night sky is influencing the practice of astronomy and astrophotograph, both at the amateur and professional levels. The presence of these satellites has the effect of introducing streaks into the images captured during astronomical observation, requiring the application of additional post processing to mitigate the undesirable impact, whether for data loss or cosmetic reasons. In this paper, we show how we test and adapt various Deep Learning approaches to detect streaks in raw astronomical data captured between March 2022 and February 2023 with smart telescopes.

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.

Abstract: This study explores two frameworks for co-speech gesture generation, AQ-GT and its semantically-augmented variant AQ-GT-a, to evaluate their ability to convey meaning through gestures and how humans perceive the resulting movements. Using sentences from the SAGA spatial communication corpus, contextually similar sentences, and novel movement-focused sentences, we conducted a user-centered evaluation of concept recognition and human-likeness. Results revealed a nuanced relationship between semantic annotations and performance. The original AQ-GT framework, lacking explicit semantic input, was surprisingly more effective at conveying concepts within its training domain. Conversely, the AQ-GT-a framework demonstrated better generalization, particularly for representing shape and size in novel contexts. While participants rated gestures from AQ-GT-a as more expressive and helpful, they did not perceive them as more human-like. These findings suggest that explicit semantic enrichment does not guarantee improved gesture generation and that its effectiveness is highly dependent on the context, indicating a potential trade-off between specialization and generalization.

Abstract: Human communication combines speech with expressive nonverbal cues such as hand gestures that serve manifold communicative functions. Yet, current generative gesture generation approaches are restricted to simple, repetitive beat gestures that accompany the rhythm of speaking but do not contribute to communicating semantic meaning. This paper tackles a core challenge in co-speech gesture synthesis: generating iconic or deictic gestures that are semantically coherent with a verbal utterance. Such gestures cannot be derived from language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is often carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot system that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is informed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention. Our method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object properties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic matching module that links these visual details to spoken text. An inverse kinematics engine then synthesizes iconic and deictic gestures and combines them with co-generated natural beat gestures for coherent multimodal communication. A comprehensive user study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In scenarios where speech alone was ambiguous, gestures generated by our system significantly improved participants' ability to identify object properties, confirming their interpretability and communicative value. While challenges remain in representing complex shapes, our results highlight the importance of context-aware semantic gestures for creating expressive and collaborative virtual agents or avatars, marking a substantial step forward towards efficient and robust, embodied human-agent interaction.

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns (NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA), which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95 critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60) and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with 2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform scale in small-data medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.

In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: Commercial plant phenotyping systems using fixed cameras cannot perceive many plant details due to leaf occlusion. In this paper, we present Botany-Bot, a system for building detailed "annotated digital twins" of living plants using two stereo cameras, a digital turntable inside a lightbox, an industrial robot arm, and 3D segmentated Gaussian Splat models. We also present robot algorithms for manipulating leaves to take high-resolution indexable images of occluded details such as stem buds and the underside/topside of leaves. Results from experiments suggest that Botany-Bot can segment leaves with 90.8% accuracy, detect leaves with 86.2% accuracy, lift/push leaves with 77.9% accuracy, and take detailed overside/underside images with 77.3% accuracy.

Abstract: Fashion compatibility models enable online retailers to easily obtain a large number of outfit compositions with good quality. However, effective fashion recommendation demands precise service for each customer with a deeper cognition of fashion. In this paper, we conduct the first study on fashion cognitive learning, which is fashion recommendations conditioned on personal physical information. To this end, we propose a Fashion Cognitive Network (FCN) to learn the relationships among visual-semantic embedding of outfit composition and appearance features of individuals. FCN contains two submodules, namely outfit encoder and Multi-label Graph Neural Network (ML-GCN). The outfit encoder uses a convolutional layer to encode an outfit into an outfit embedding. The latter module learns label classifiers via stacked GCN. We conducted extensive experiments on the newly collected O4U dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence that our framework outperforms alternative methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of client-server localization, where edge device users communicate visual data with the service provider for locating oneself against a pre-built 3D map. This localization paradigm is a crucial component for location-based services in AR/VR or mobile applications, as it is not trivial to store large-scale 3D maps and process fast localization on resource-limited edge devices. Nevertheless, conventional client-server localization systems possess numerous challenges in computational efficiency, robustness, and privacy-preservation during data transmission. Our work aims to jointly solve these challenges with a localization pipeline based on event cameras. By using event cameras, our system consumes low energy and maintains small memory bandwidth. Then during localization, we propose applying event-to-image conversion and leverage mature image-based localization, which achieves robustness even in low-light or fast-moving scenes. To further enhance privacy protection, we introduce privacy protection techniques at two levels. Network level protection aims to hide the entire user's view in private scenes using a novel split inference approach, while sensor level protection aims to hide sensitive user details such as faces with light-weight filtering. Both methods involve small client-side computation and localization performance loss, while significantly mitigating the feeling of insecurity as revealed in our user study. We thus project our method to serve as a building block for practical location-based services using event cameras.

<title>Limitations of Data-Driven Spectral Reconstruction -- An Optics-Aware Analysis</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging empowers machine vision systems with the distinct capability of identifying materials through recording their spectral signatures. Recent efforts in data-driven spectral reconstruction aim at extracting spectral information from RGB images captured by cost-effective RGB cameras, instead of dedicated hardware. Published work reports exceedingly high numerical scores for this reconstruction task, yet real-world performance lags substantially behind. We systematically analyze the performance of such methods. First, we evaluate the overfitting limitations with respect to current datasets by training the networks with less data, validating the trained models with unseen yet slightly modified data and cross-dataset validation. Second, we reveal fundamental limitations in the ability of RGB to spectral methods to deal with metameric or near-metameric conditions, which have so far gone largely unnoticed due to the insufficiencies of existing datasets. We validate the trained models with metamer data generated by metameric black theory and re-training the networks with various forms of metamers. This methodology can also be used for data augmentation as a partial mitigation of the dataset issues, although the RGB to spectral inverse problem remains fundamentally ill-posed. Finally, we analyze the potential for modifying the problem setting to achieve better performance by exploiting optical encoding provided by either optical aberrations or deliberate optical design. Our experiments show such approaches provide improved results under certain circumstances, but their overall performance is limited by the same dataset issues. We conclude that future progress on snapshot spectral imaging will heavily depend on the generation of improved datasets which can then be used to design effective optical encoding strategies.

Abstract: The paper proposes FireANTs, a multi-scale Adaptive Riemannian Optimization algorithm for dense diffeomorphic image matching. Existing state-of-the-art methods for diffeomorphic image matching are slow due to inefficient implementations and slow convergence due to the ill-conditioned nature of the optimization problem. Deep learning methods offer fast inference but require extensive training time, substantial inference memory, and fail to generalize across long-tailed distributions or diverse image modalities, necessitating costly retraining. We address these challenges by proposing a training-free, GPU-accelerated multi-scale Adaptive Riemannian Optimization algorithm for fast and accurate dense diffeomorphic image matching. FireANTs runs about 2.5x faster than ANTs on a CPU, and upto 1200x faster on a GPU. On a single GPU, FireANTs performs competitively with deep learning methods on inference runtime while consuming upto 10x less memory. FireANTs shows remarkable robustness to a wide variety of matching problems across modalities, species, and organs without any domain-specific training or tuning. Our framework allows hyperparameter grid search studies with significantly less resources and time compared to traditional and deep learning registration algorithms alike.

Abstract: Human motion understanding is a fundamental task with diverse practical applications, facilitated by the availability of large-scale motion capture datasets. Recent studies focus on text-motion tasks, such as text-based motion generation, editing and question answering. In this study, we introduce the novel task of text-based human motion grounding (THMG), aimed at precisely localizing temporal segments corresponding to given textual descriptions within untrimmed motion sequences. Capturing global temporal information is crucial for the THMG task. However, Transformer-based models that rely on global temporal self-attention face challenges when handling long untrimmed sequences due to the quadratic computational cost. We address these challenges by proposing Text-controlled Motion Mamba (TM-Mamba), a unified model that integrates temporal global context, language query control, and spatial graph topology with only linear memory cost. The core of the model is a text-controlled selection mechanism which dynamically incorporates global temporal information based on text query. The model is further enhanced to be topology-aware through the integration of relational embeddings. For evaluation, we introduce BABEL-Grounding, the first text-motion dataset that provides detailed textual descriptions of human actions along with their corresponding temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of TM-Mamba on BABEL-Grounding.

<title>Predicting High-precision Depth on Low-Precision Devices Using 2D Hilbert Curves</title>

Abstract: Dense depth prediction deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved impressive results for both monocular and binocular data, but still they are limited by high computational complexity, restricting their use on low-end devices. For better on-device efficiency and hardware utilization, weights and activations of the DNN should be converted to low-bit precision. However, this precision is not sufficient to represent high dynamic range depth. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation and restore high-precision depth from low-bit precision predictions. To achieve this, we propose to represent high dynamic range depth as two low dynamic range components of a Hilbert curve, and to train the full-precision DNN to directly predict the latter. For on-device deployment, we use standard quantization methods and add a post-processing step that reconstructs depth from the Hilbert curve components predicted in low-bit precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method increases the bit precision of predicted depth by up to three bits with little computational overhead. We also observed a positive side effect of quantization error reduction by up to 4.6 times. Our method enables effective and accurate depth prediction with DNN weights and activations quantized to eight-bit precision.

Abstract: As pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have become a useful tool for image synthesis, people want to specify the results in various ways. This paper tackles training-free appearance transfer, which produces an image with the structure of a target image from the appearance of a reference image. Existing methods usually do not reflect semantic correspondence, as they rely on query-key similarity within the self-attention layer to establish correspondences between images. To this end, we propose explicitly rearranging the features according to the dense semantic correspondences. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method in various aspects: preserving the structure of the target and reflecting the correct color from the reference, even when the two images are not aligned.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of geo-localization with a new paradigm using a large vision-language model (LVLM) augmented with human inference knowledge. A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.

<title>Scalable Frame Sampling for Video Classification: A Semi-Optimal Policy Approach with Reduced Search Space</title>

Abstract: Given a video with $T$ frames, frame sampling is a task to select $N \ll T$ frames, so as to maximize the performance of a fixed video classifier. Not just brute-force search, but most existing methods suffer from its vast search space of $\binom{T}{N}$, especially when $N$ gets large. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective of reducing the search space from $O(T^N)$ to $O(T)$. Instead of exploring the entire $O(T^N)$ space, our proposed semi-optimal policy selects the top $N$ frames based on the independently estimated value of each frame using per-frame confidence, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We verify that our semi-optimal policy can efficiently approximate the optimal policy, particularly under practical settings. Additionally, through extensive experiments on various datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that learning our semi-optimal policy ensures stable and high performance regardless of the size of $N$ and $T$.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors is critical for applications in healthcare, safety, and industrial production. However, variations in activity patterns, device types, and sensor placements create distribution gaps across datasets, reducing the performance of HAR models. To address this, we propose LanHAR, a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic interpretations of sensor readings and activity labels for cross-dataset HAR. This approach not only mitigates cross-dataset heterogeneity but also enhances the recognition of new activities. LanHAR employs an iterative re-generation method to produce high-quality semantic interpretations with LLMs and a two-stage training framework that bridges the semantic interpretations of sensor readings and activity labels. This ultimately leads to a lightweight sensor encoder suitable for mobile deployment, enabling any sensor reading to be mapped into the semantic interpretation space. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-dataset HAR and new activity recognition. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/DASHLab/LanHAR.

Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion diffusion models have enabled spatially controllable text-to-motion generation. However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.

Abstract: Addressing data integrity challenges, such as unlearning the effects of data poisoning after model training, is necessary for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. State-of-the-art influence functions, such as EK-FAC and TRAK, often fail to accurately attribute abnormal model behavior to the specific poisoned training data responsible for the data poisoning attack. In addition, traditional unlearning algorithms often struggle to effectively remove the influence of poisoned samples, particularly when only a few affected examples can be identified. To address these challenge, we introduce $\Delta$-Influence, a novel approach that leverages influence functions to trace abnormal model behavior back to the responsible poisoned training data using as little as just one poisoned test example. $\Delta$-Influence applies data transformations that sever the link between poisoned training data and compromised test points without significantly affecting clean data. This allows $\Delta$-Influence to detect large negative shifts in influence scores following data transformations, a phenomenon we term as influence collapse, thereby accurately identifying poisoned training data. Unlearning this subset, e.g. through retraining, effectively eliminates the data poisoning. We validate our method across three vision-based poisoning attacks and three datasets, benchmarking against five detection algorithms and five unlearning strategies. We show that $\Delta$-Influence consistently achieves the best unlearning across all settings, showing the promise of influence functions for corrective unlearning.

Abstract: Existing recommendation systems either rely on user interaction logs, such as online shopping history for shopping recommendations, or focus on text signals. However, item-based histories are not always accessible, and are not generalizable for multimodal recommendation. We hypothesize that a user's visual history -- comprising images from daily life -- can offer rich, task-agnostic insights into their interests and preferences, and thus be leveraged for effective personalization. To this end, we propose VisualLens, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable personalization using task-agnostic visual history. VisualLens extracts, filters, and refines a spectrum user profile from the visual history to support personalized recommendation. We created two new benchmarks, Google-Review-V and Yelp-V, with task-agnostic visual histories, and show that VisualLens improves over state-of-the-art item-based multimodal recommendations by 5-10% on Hit@3, and outperforms GPT-4o by 2-5%. Further analysis shows that VisualLens is robust across varying history lengths and excels at adapting to both longer histories and unseen content categories.

Abstract: Long-duration talking video synthesis faces enduring challenges in achieving high video quality, portrait and temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, identity inconsistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly problematic, severely affecting the realism and reliability of the results. To address these challenges, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework equipped with multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient generation of long-duration talking videos. In particular, LetsTalk introduces a noise-regularized memory bank to alleviate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during extended video generation. To further improve efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. We systematically analyze three fusion schemes and show that combining deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio achieves superior visual realism and precise speech-driven motion, while preserving diversity of movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk establishes new state-of-the-art in generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, and maintains remarkable efficiency with 8x fewer parameters than previous approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks for text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead. Experimental results confirm that Free$^2$Guide using image-trained LVLMs significantly improves text-to-video alignment, thereby enhancing the overall video quality.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation is essential for advancing the creative industry but often presents challenges in producing consistent, realistic motions. To address this, we focus on fine-tuning text-to-motion models to consistently favor high-quality, human-preferred motions, a critical yet largely unexplored problem. In this work, we theoretically investigate the DPO under both online and offline settings, and reveal their respective limitation: overfitting in offline DPO, and biased sampling in online DPO. Building on our theoretical insights, we introduce Semi-online Preference Optimization (SoPo), a DPO-based method for training text-to-motion models using "semi-online" data pair, consisting of unpreferred motion from online distribution and preferred motion in offline datasets. This method leverages both online and offline DPO, allowing each to compensate for the other's limitations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoPo outperforms other preference alignment methods, with an MM-Dist of 3.25% (vs e.g. 0.76% of MoDiPO) on the MLD model, 2.91% (vs e.g. 0.66% of MoDiPO) on MDM model, respectively. Additionally, the MLD model fine-tuned by our SoPo surpasses the SoTA model in terms of R-precision and MM Dist. Visualization results also show the efficacy of our SoPo in preference alignment.

<title>FairGen: Enhancing Fairness in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Self-Discovering Latent Directions</title>

Abstract: While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various image generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in the training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model retraining with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.

<title>NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

Abstract: We present a method for augmenting real-world videos with newly generated dynamic content. Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained vision-language model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.

Abstract: Action recognition in dark or low-light (under-exposed) videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human preference optimization, originally developed for Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in improving text-to-image diffusion models. These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, within the existing preference datasets, the original caption often does not clearly favor the preferred image over the alternative, which weakens the supervision signal available during training. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a data augmentation and optimization framework that reinforces the learning signal by assigning two distinct captions to each preference pair. This encourages the model to better differentiate between preferred and less-preferred outcomes during training. We also construct Pick-Double Caption, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for each image, and propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel image-based rendering technique for jointly estimating indoor lighting and thermal conditions from paired indoor-outdoor high dynamic range (HDR) panoramas. Our method uses the indoor panorama to estimate the 3D floor layout, while the corresponding outdoor panorama serves as an environment map to infer spatially-varying illumination and material properties. Assuming indoor surfaces are Lambertian and that all heat originates from outdoor visible light, we model the relationship between light transport and heat transfer, and perform transient heat simulations to generate indoor temperature distributions. The simulated heat maps are validated against real-world thermal images captured with an infrared camera. This approach supports photorealistic and physically informed visualization, enabling integrated light and heat estimation to advance traditional virtual home staging.

Abstract: Accurate 3D shape representation is essential in engineering applications such as design, optimization, and simulation. In practice, engineering workflows require structured, part-based representations, as objects are inherently designed as assemblies of distinct components. However, most existing methods either model shapes holistically or decompose them without predefined part structures, limiting their applicability in real-world design tasks. We propose PartSDF, a supervised implicit representation framework that explicitly models composite shapes with independent, controllable parts while maintaining shape consistency. Thanks to its simple but innovative architecture, PartSDF outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in reconstruction and generation tasks. We further demonstrate its effectiveness as a structured shape prior for engineering applications, enabling precise control over individual components while preserving overall coherence.

Abstract: The objective in this paper is to improve the performance of text-to-image retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new framework that can boost the performance of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, so that they can be used for text-to-image re-ranking. The approach, Enhanced Language-Image Pre-training (ELIP), uses the text query, via a simple MLP mapping network, to predict a set of visual prompts to condition the ViT image encoding. ELIP can easily be applied to the commonly used CLIP, SigLIP and BLIP-2 networks. To train the architecture with limited computing resources, we develop a 'student friendly' best practice, involving global hard sample mining, and curation of a large-scale dataset. On the evaluation side, we set up two new out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, Occluded COCO and ImageNet-R, to assess the zero-shot generalisation of the models to different domains. The results demonstrate that ELIP significantly boosts CLIP/SigLIP/SigLIP-2 text-to-image retrieval performance and outperforms BLIP-2 on several benchmarks, as well as providing an easy means to adapt to OOD datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

Abstract: Corals serve as the foundational habitat-building organisms within reef ecosystems, constructing extensive structures that extend over vast distances. However, their inherent fragility and vulnerability to various threats render them susceptible to significant damage and destruction. The application of advanced 3D reconstruction technologies for high-quality modeling is crucial for preserving them. These technologies help scientists to accurately document and monitor the state of coral reefs, including their structure, species distribution and changes over time. Photogrammetry-based approaches stand out among existing solutions, especially with recent advancements in underwater videography, photogrammetric computer vision, and machine learning. Despite continuous progress in image-based 3D reconstruction techniques, there remains a lack of systematic reviews and comprehensive evaluations of cutting-edge solutions specifically applied to underwater coral reef images. The emerging advanced methods may have difficulty coping with underwater imaging environments, complex coral structures, and computational resource constraints. They need to be reviewed and evaluated to bridge the gap between many cutting-edge technical studies and practical applications. This paper focuses on the two critical stages of these approaches: camera pose estimation and dense surface reconstruction. We systematically review and summarize classical and emerging methods, conducting comprehensive evaluations through real-world and simulated datasets. Based on our findings, we offer reference recommendations and discuss the development potential and challenges of existing approaches in depth. This work equips scientists and managers with a technical foundation and practical guidance for processing underwater coral reef images for 3D reconstruction....

Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary object detectors can generalize to an unrestricted set of categories through simple textual prompting. However, adapting these models to rare classes or reinforcing their abilities on multiple specialized domains remains essential. While recent methods rely on monolithic adaptation strategies with a single set of weights, we embrace modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to build and maintain a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub manages expert modules as branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of the compositional properties of adaptation modules, marking the first such study in Object Detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to assess class reappearance.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, but its reliance on large volumes of high-quality labeled data limits its applicability. While noisy labeled data are easier to obtain, directly incorporating them into training can degrade model performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Mean Teacher-based Adaptive Label Correction (ALC) self-ensemble framework for robust medical image segmentation with noisy labels. The framework leverages the Mean Teacher architecture to ensure consistent learning under noise perturbations. It includes an adaptive label refinement mechanism that dynamically captures and weights differences across multiple disturbance versions to enhance the quality of noisy labels. Additionally, a sample-level uncertainty-based label selection algorithm is introduced to prioritize high-confidence samples for network updates, mitigating the impact of noisy annotations. Consistency learning is integrated to align the predictions of the student and teacher networks, further enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in segmentation performance. By fully exploiting the strengths of the Mean Teacher structure, the ALC framework effectively processes noisy labels, adapts to challenging scenarios, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding but often lack reliable grounding capabilities and actionable inference rates. Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments. Code, data, videos, and benchmarks are available at https://vlm-gist.github.io

Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/SaDil13/VLN-RAM.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation raise hopes that these models possess world modeling capabilities, the ability to generate realistic, physically plausible videos. This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos. All data, leaderboard, and code are open-sourced at our project page.

Abstract: We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources.

Abstract: Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.

<title>Generate, but Verify: Reducing Hallucination in Vision-Language Models with Retrospective Resampling</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer from visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent objects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical applications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations. Our evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO and 34% on HaloQuest. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://reverse-vlm.github.io.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification aims to recognize objects belonging to many subordinate categories of a supercategory, where appearance alone often fails to distinguish highly similar classes. We propose a unified framework that integrates image, text, and metadata via cross-contrastive pre-training. We first align the three modality encoders in a shared embedding space and then fine-tune the image and metadata encoders for classification. On NABirds, our approach improves over the baseline by 7.83% and achieves 84.44% top-1 accuracy, outperforming strong multimodal methods.

<title>Learning Cocoercive Conservative Denoisers via Helmholtz Decomposition for Poisson Inverse Problems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods with deep denoisers have shown impressive results in imaging problems. They typically require strong convexity or smoothness of the fidelity term and a (residual) non-expansive denoiser for convergence. These assumptions, however, are violated in Poisson inverse problems, and non-expansiveness can hinder denoising performance. To address these challenges, we propose a cocoercive conservative (CoCo) denoiser, which may be (residual) expansive, leading to improved denoising. By leveraging the generalized Helmholtz decomposition, we introduce a novel training strategy that combines Hamiltonian regularization to promote conservativeness and spectral regularization to ensure cocoerciveness. We prove that CoCo denoiser is a proximal operator of a weakly convex function, enabling a restoration model with an implicit weakly convex prior. The global convergence of PnP methods to a stationary point of this restoration model is established. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms closely related methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/HorizonTEL/AIGIBench.

Abstract: Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating "$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions of its hat. We call this kind of generation \textit{\textbf{personalized attribute-reasoning generation}}. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing concept understanding, concept generation, and attribute-reasoning generation. Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized attribute-reasoning generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield valuable insights into understanding. Our code and dataset will be released at: \href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/UniCTokens}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/UniCTokens}.

Abstract: 6DoF object pose estimation is fundamental to robotic grasp tasks. While recent learning-based methods achieve high accuracy, their computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. In this work, we revisit the classical keypoint matching paradigm and propose GMatch, a lightweight, geometry-constrained keypoint matcher that can run efficiently on embedded CPU-only platforms. GMatch works with keypoint descriptors and it uses a set of geometric constraints to establishes inherent ambiguities between features extracted by descriptors, thus giving a globally consistent correspondences from which 6DoF pose can be easily solved. We benchmark GMatch on the HOPE and YCB-Video datasets, where our method beats existing keypoint matchers (both feature-based and geometry-based) among three commonly used descriptors and approaches the SOTA zero-shot method on texture-rich objects with much more humble devices. The method is further deployed on a LoCoBot mobile manipulator, enabling a one-shot grasp pipeline that demonstrates high task success rates in real-world experiments. In a word, by its lightweight and white-box nature, GMatch offers a practical solution for resource-limited robotic systems, and although currently bottlenecked by descriptor quality, the framework presents a promising direction towards robust yet efficient pose estimation.

<title>Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Fused Unified Nonconvex Tensor Ring Factors Regularization</title>

arXiv:2505.17881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

<title>Styl3R: Instant 3D Stylized Reconstruction for Arbitrary Scenes and Styles</title>

Abstract: Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a taxonomy of materials for hierarchical recognition from local appearance. Our taxonomy is motivated by vision applications and is arranged according to the physical traits of materials. We contribute a diverse, in-the-wild dataset with images and depth maps of the taxonomy classes. Utilizing the taxonomy and dataset, we present a method for hierarchical material recognition based on graph attention networks. Our model leverages the taxonomic proximity between classes and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate the model's potential to generalize to adverse, real-world imaging conditions, and that novel views rendered using the depth maps can enhance this capability. Finally, we show the model's capacity to rapidly learn new materials in a few-shot learning setting.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow, encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning, comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning language models have significantly advanced text-based reasoning. On the other hand, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind, hindered by their outdated internal LLMs. Upgrading these is often prohibitively expensive, as it requires complete vision-language alignment retraining which is costly. To address this issue, we introduce Perception-Reasoning Decoupling, which modularizes the MLLM's reasoning component and makes it easily replaceable. This approach redefines the MLLM's role to convert multi-modal inputs into detailed textual outputs that can be processed by any powerful, external, text-only LLM reasoners. To align the MLLM's perceptual output with the final reasoning task, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Visual Perception Optimization (VPO). VPO rewards the MLLM based on the correctness of answers generated by the external reasoner to produce faithful and query-relevant captions. Together, this decoupling pipeline and VPO form our Reasoning-Aligned PerceptIon Decoupling (RAPID) approach. Empirical results show that RAPID achieves significant performance gains on multi-modal reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, RAPID enables a novel inference-time scaling paradigm: Once trained with VPO, the MLLM can be paired with any state-of-the-art LLM reasoner for consistent performance improvement without retraining.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories. The code is available at https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/Asymmetry-Zigzag-StoryDiffusion.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way, we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage, given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control, has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy. Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

<title>Auto-Connect: Connectivity-Preserving RigFormer with Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions represented as two joints or first predict points before determining connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties.

<title>ASCD: Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding for Reducing Hallucination in MLLM</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently hallucinate by over-committing to spurious visual cues. Prior remedies-Visual and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (VCD, ICD)-mitigate this issue, yet the mechanism remains opaque. We first empirically show that their improvements systematically coincide with redistributions of cross-modal attention. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding (ASCD), which directly steers the attention scores during decoding. ASCD combines (i) positive steering, which amplifies automatically mined text-centric heads-stable within a model and robust across domains-with (ii) negative steering, which dampens on-the-fly identified critical visual tokens. The method incurs negligible runtime and memory overhead and requires no additional training. Across five MLLM backbones and three decoding schemes, ASCD reduces hallucination on POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench by up to 38.2 percent while improving accuracy on standard VQA benchmarks, including MMMU, MM-VET, ScienceQA, TextVQA, and GQA. These results position attention steering as a simple, model-agnostic, and principled route to safer, more faithful multimodal generation.

<title>From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20977</link>

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To tackle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception information without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we incorporate geometry and perception priors to initialize the Gaussian branches and guide their parameter optimization. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we introduce a stable Score Distillation Sampling for fine-grained prior distillation to ensure effective knowledge transfer. The model is further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experimental results show that we outperform existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/rAIson-Lab/G2D.

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot video classification for extremely fine-grained actions (e.g., Windmill Dunk in basketball), where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen classes. While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

arXiv:2506.24086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), multimodal frameworks that unify understanding and generation have become promising, yet they face increasing complexity as the number of modalities and tasks grows. We observe that motion quantization introduces approximation errors that cap motion quality, and that unifying discrete text and continuous motion within a single-stream backbone amplifies cross-modal interference. Motivated by recent multi-branch Transformer designs that separate signals from different modalities, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model for both understanding and generation. MotionGPT3 encodes raw motion into a continuous latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE), thereby avoiding quantization-induced artifacts, while leveraging the semantic prior of pretrained language models. A dual-stream Transformer with shared attention preserves modality-specific routes while enabling controlled, bidirectional information flow, which reduces interference, stabilizing optimization, and empirically accelerates convergence without degrading fidelity. For multimodal joint training, a generate-then-align three-stage schedule further improves stability and limits cross-task interference. Experiments show that MotionGPT3 achieves 2x faster convergence in training loss and up to 4x faster convergence in validation, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on standard motion understanding and motion generation benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories, and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density. HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various tasks.

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored, high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models, rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention, propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only model immediate effects. Our key observation is that tokens linked to semantically similar regions form metastable states, i.e., regions where attention tends to concentrate, while noisy attention scores dissipate. Metastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global token importance. We show that TokenRank enhances unconditional image generation, improving both quality (IS) and diversity (FID), and can also be incorporated into existing segmentation techniques to improve their performance over existing benchmarks. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can translate images to code, they often fail on complex UIs, struggling to unify visual perception, layout planning, and code synthesis within a single monolithic model, which leads to frequent perception and planning errors. To address this, we propose ScreenCoder, a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes the task into three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. By assigning these distinct responsibilities to specialized agents, our framework achieves significantly higher robustness and fidelity than end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, ScreenCoder serves as a scalable data engine, enabling us to generate high-quality image-code pairs. We use this data to fine-tune open-source MLLM via a dual-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, demonstrating substantial gains in its UI generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to extract useful representations from high-dimensional inputs while learning effective control from sparse and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input. All the resources are available at https://walkermitty.github.io/VimoRAG/

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems. The Intersection-Flow-5k dataset is available at https://github.com/AstronZh/Intersection-Flow-5K.

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA (SaSaSa2VA) to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $\mathcal{J\&amp;F}$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration. While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0 delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes medical AI.

<title>Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance</title>

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on \emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space, causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process; \emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach, \textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the \textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode \textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers, we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting -- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

<title>Shaken or Stirred? An Analysis of MetaFormer's Token Mixing for Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution. Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed. Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation quality and sampling speed.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.

Abstract: We introduce the delta-homology model of memory, a unified framework in which recall, learning, and prediction emerge from cycle closure, the completion of topologically constrained trajectories within the brain's latent manifold. A Dirac-like memory trace corresponds to a nontrivial homology generator, representing a sparse, irreducible attractor that reactivates only when inference trajectories close upon themselves. In this view, memory is not a static attractor landscape but a topological process of recurrence, where structure arises through the stabilization of closed loops. Building on this principle, we represent spike-timing dynamics as spatiotemporal complexes, in which temporally consistent transitions among neurons form chain complexes supporting persistent activation cycles. These cycles are organized into cell posets, compact causal representations that encode overlapping and compositional memory traces. Within this construction, learning and recall correspond to cycle closure under contextual modulation: inference trajectories stabilize into nontrivial homology classes when both local synchrony (context) and global recurrence (content) are satisfied. We formalize this mechanism through the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), which states that cognition minimizes joint uncertainty between a high-entropy context variable and a low-entropy content variable. Synchronization acts as a context filter selecting coherent subnetworks, while recurrence acts as a content filter validating nontrivial cycles.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Objective: Identifying patients at high risk of mortality is crucial for emergency physicians to allocate hospital resources effectively, particularly in regions with limited medical services. This need becomes even more pressing during global health crises that lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to present the usability deep neural decision forest and deep neural decision tree to predict mortality among Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To this end, We used patient data encompassing Coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis, demographics, health indicators, and occupational risk factors to analyze disease severity and outcomes. The dataset was partitioned using a stratified sampling method, ensuring that 80% was allocated for training and 20% for testing. Nine machine learning and deep learning methods were employed to build predictive models. The models were evaluated across all stages to determine their effectiveness in predicting patient outcomes. Results: Among the models, the deep neural decision forest consistently outperformed others. Results indicated that using only clinical data yielded an accuracy of 80% by deep neural decision forest, demonstrating it as a reliable predictor of patient mortality. Moreover, the results suggest that clinical data alone may be the most accurate diagnostic tool for predicting mortality.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks can automatically learn features via deep network architectures and given input samples. However, the robustness of obtained models may face challenges in varying scenes. Bigger differences in network architecture are beneficial to extract more diversified structural information to strengthen the robustness of an obtained super-resolution model. In this paper, we proposed a adaptive convolutional neural network for image super-resolution (ADSRNet). To capture more information, ADSRNet is implemented by a heterogeneous parallel network. The upper network can enhance relation of context information, salient information relation of a kernel mapping and relations of shallow and deep layers to improve performance of image super-resolution. That can strengthen adaptability of an obtained super-resolution model for different scenes. The lower network utilizes a symmetric architecture to enhance relations of different layers to mine more structural information, which is complementary with a upper network for image super-resolution. The relevant experimental results show that the proposed ADSRNet is effective to deal with image resolving. Codes are obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/ADSRNet.

Abstract: Multisequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a more reliable diagnosis in clinical applications through complementary information across sequences. However, in practice, the absence of certain MR sequences is a common problem that can lead to inconsistent analysis results. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework for synthesizing multisequence MR images, called hybrid-fusion GAN (HF-GAN). The fundamental mechanism of this work is principled feature disentanglement, which aligns the design of the architecture with the complexity of the features. A powerful many-to-one stream is constructed for the extraction of complex complementary features, while utilizing parallel, one-to-one streams to process modality-specific information. These disentangled features are dynamically integrated into a common latent space by a channel attention-based fusion module (CAFF) and then transformed via a modality infuser to generate the target sequence. We validated our framework on public datasets of both healthy and pathological brain MRI. Quantitative and qualitative results show that HF-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with our 2D slice-based framework notably outperforming a leading 3D volumetric model. Furthermore, the utilization of HF-GAN for data imputation substantially improves the performance of the downstream brain tumor segmentation task, demonstrating its clinical relevance.

Abstract: Purpose: To accelerate MRI acquisition by incorporating the previous scans of a subject during reconstruction. Although longitudinal imaging constitutes much of clinical MRI, leveraging previous scans is challenging due to the complex relationship between scan sessions, potentially involving substantial anatomical or pathological changes, and the lack of open-access datasets with both longitudinal pairs and raw k-space needed for training deep learning-based reconstruction models. Methods: We propose a diffusion-model-based reconstruction framework that eliminates the need for longitudinally paired training data. During training, we treat all scan timepoints as samples from the same distribution, therefore requiring only standalone images. At inference, our framework integrates a subject's prior scan in magnitude DICOM format, which is readily available in clinical workflows, to guide reconstruction of the follow-up. To support future development, we introduce an open-access clinical dataset containing multi-session pairs including prior DICOMs and follow-up k-space. Results: Our method consistently outperforms both longitudinal and non-longitudinal baseline reconstruction methods across various accelerated Cartesian acquisition strategies. In imaging regions highly similar to the prior scan, we observe up to 10\% higher SSIM and 2 dB higher PSNR, without degradation in dissimilar areas. Compared to longitudinal reconstruction baselines, our method demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of anatomical change and misregistration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that prior scans can be effectively integrated with state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction methods to improve image quality and enable greater scan acceleration, without requiring an extensive longitudinally-paired training dataset.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering (e.g., physical, biochemical, medical) practices, data generated through expensive experiments or large-scale simulations, are often sparse and noisy. Physics-informed neural network (PINN) incorporates physical information and knowledge into network topology or computational processes as model priors, with the unique advantage of achieving strong generalization with small data. This study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of the soft-constrained PINN method to solving typical linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) such as primer, Van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, especially the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness to noise with minimal data. It is verified that the soft-constrained PINN significantly reduces the need for labeled data. With the aid of appropriate collocation points no need to be labeled, it can predict and also extrapolate with minimal data. First-order and second-order ODEs, no matter linear or nonlinear oscillators, require only one and two training data (containing initial values) respectively, just like classical analytic or Runge-Kutta methods, and with equivalent precision and comparable efficiency (fast training in seconds for scalar ODEs). Furthermore, it can conveniently impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, improving the performance to deal with various complexities such as nonlinearity like Duffing. The DeepXDE-based PINN implementation is light code and can be efficiently trained on both GPU and CPU platforms. The mathematical and computational framework of this alternative and feasible PINN method to ODEs, can be easily extended to PDEs, etc., and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical in high-stakes applications, such as medical diagnosis, where confidently incorrect predictions can erode trust in automated decision-making systems. Traditional uncertainty quantification methods rely on a predefined confidence threshold to classify predictions as confident or uncertain. However, this approach assumes that predictions exceeding the threshold are trustworthy, while those below it are uncertain, without explicitly assessing the correctness of high-confidence predictions. As a result, confidently incorrect predictions may still occur, leading to misleading uncertainty assessments. To address this limitation, this study proposed an uncertainty-aware stacked neural network, which extends conventional uncertainty quantification by learning when predictions should be trusted. The framework consists of a two-tier model: the base model generates predictions with uncertainty estimates, while the meta-model learns to assign a trust flag, distinguishing confidently correct cases from those requiring expert review. The proposed approach is evaluated against the traditional threshold-based method across multiple confidence thresholds and pre-trained architectures using the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces confidently incorrect predictions, offering a more trustworthy and efficient decision-support system for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Enabling digital humans to express rich emotions has significant applications in dialogue systems, gaming, and other interactive scenarios. While recent advances in talking head synthesis have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization, they tend to overlook the rich and dynamic nature of facial expressions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce an end-to-end text-to-expression model that explicitly focuses on emotional dynamics. Our model learns expressive facial variations in a continuous latent space and generates expressions that are diverse, fluid, and emotionally coherent. To support this task, we introduce EmoAva, a large-scale and high-quality dataset containing 15,000 text-3D expression pairs. Extensive experiments on both existing datasets and EmoAva demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

To address this gap, we present PASTA, a pan-tumor radiology foundation model built on PASTA-Gen, a synthetic data framework that generated 30,000 3D CT scans with pixel-level lesion masks and structured reports of tumors across ten organ systems. Leveraging this resource, PASTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 oncology tasks, including non-contrast CT tumor screening, lesion segmentation, structured reporting, tumor staging, survival prediction, and MRI-modality transfer. To assess clinical applicability, we developed PASTA-AID, a clinical decision support system, and ran a retrospective simulated clinical trial across two scenarios. For pan-tumor screening on plain CT with fixed reading time, PASTA-AID increased radiologists' throughput by 11.1-25.1% and improved sensitivity by 17.0-31.4% and precision by 10.5-24.9%; additionally, in a diagnosis-aid workflow, it reduced segmentation time by up to 78.2% and reporting time by up to 36.5%. Beyond gains in accuracy and efficiency, PASTA-AID narrowed the expertise gap, enabling less-experienced radiologists to approach expert-level performance. Together, this work establishes an end-to-end, synthetic data-driven pipeline spanning data generation, model development, and clinical validation, thereby demonstrating substantial potential for pan-tumor research and clinical translation.

Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.

Abstract: Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a forward process, where samples are progressively perturbed with Gaussian noise according to a predefined noise schedule. From a geometric perspective, each noise schedule corresponds to a unique trajectory in probability space from the data distribution to a Gaussian prior. However, prior diffusion models rely on empirically chosen schedules that may not be optimal. This inefficiency necessitates many intermediate time steps, resulting in high computational costs during both training and sampling. To address this, we derive a family of geodesic noise schedules corresponding to the shortest paths in probability space under the Fisher-Rao metric. Based on these schedules, we propose Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs), which significantly improve training and sampling efficiency by minimizing the energy required to transform between probability distributions. This efficiency further enables sampling to start from an intermediate distribution in conditional image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results with as few as 6 steps. We evaluated GDM on two medical image enhancement tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by 20- to 30-fold compared to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and 4- to 6-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, and accelerating sampling by 160- to 170-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. These gains support the use of GDM for efficient model development and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/GDM-VE.

Abstract: This work proposes an industry-level omni-modal large language model (LLM) pipeline that integrates auditory, visual, and linguistic modalities to overcome challenges such as limited tri-modal datasets, high computational costs, and complex feature alignments. Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.

Abstract: Terrain analysis is critical for the practical ap- plication of ground mobile robots in real-world tasks, espe- cially in outdoor unstructured environments. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.

Abstract: For scene understanding in unstructured environments, an accurate and uncertainty-aware metric-semantic mapping is required to enable informed action selection by autonomous systems. Existing mapping methods often suffer from overconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading to inconsistent map representations. In this paper, we therefore introduce EvidMTL, a multi-task learning framework that uses evidential heads for depth estimation and semantic segmentation, enabling uncertainty-aware inference from monocular RGB images. To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task learning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly optimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with evidential segmentation loss. Building on this, we present EvidKimera, an uncertainty-aware semantic surface mapping framework, which uses evidential depth and semantics prediction for improved 3D metric-semantic consistency. We train and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot performance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In zero-shot mapping tests on ScanNetV2, EvidKimera outperforms Kimera in semantic surface mapping accuracy and consistency, highlighting the benefits of uncertainty-aware mapping and underscoring its potential for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is among the most popular neighbor embedding methods. The method relies on attractive and repulsive forces among high-dimensional data points to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. In this paper, we analyze the forces to reveal their effects on cluster formations and visualization and compare UMAP to its contemporaries. Repulsion emphasizes differences, controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our analysis makes UMAP and similar embedding methods more interpretable, more robust, and more accurate.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have attracted widespread attention for their remarkable capabilities in multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.

<title>Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing</title>

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.

<title>Exploring the Limits of Vision-Language-Action Manipulations in Cross-task Generalization</title>

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

<title>RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through self-exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiechun298/SV-DRR.

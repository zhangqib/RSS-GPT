Summary: 
OTSurv is a novel multiple instance learning framework that uses optimal transport to capture pathological heterogeneity in whole slide images for survival prediction. It incorporates global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints to ensure accurate predictions. By formulating survival predictions as an optimal transport problem with these constraints, OTSurv achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks with a 3.6% improvement in average C-index. It also offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology. The framework can be efficiently solved using a hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Emphasizing high-confidence patches while suppressing noise, OTSurv addresses mode collapse and excessive uniformity issues. The statistical significance in log-rank tests further validates its effectiveness, providing a robust and reliable approach for survival prediction using whole slide images.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

<br>
Summary:<br>
- Image depth estimation methods have been successful in video depth estimation, but the requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different.
- Consistent video depth in static regions can be achieved more effectively through stereo matching across all frames, providing strong global 3D cues.
- Dynamic regions require learning from large-scale video depth data for smooth transitions due to triangulation constraint violations.
- StereoDiff is a two-stage video depth estimator that combines stereo matching for static areas and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas, showcasing complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis.
- Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks demonstrate StereoDiff's state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and consistency. <br> <div>

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Summary:<br>
The paper presents ConViTac, a network for visual-tactile representation learning that utilizes contrastive representations to improve feature alignment during fusion. It introduces the Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism, utilizing a contrastive encoder to project visual and tactile inputs into unified latent embeddings. These embeddings facilitate cross-modal attention for aligning representations and enhancing task performance. Extensive experiments show ConViTac outperforms existing methods in real-world scenarios. The CEC mechanism boosts accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks. <div>

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks. Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks.

<div> Keywords: Medical image segmentation, U-Net, nnU-Net, BraTS 2023, Dice scores

Summary:
Medical image segmentation using U-Net based architectures and nnU-Net has significantly improved medical diagnosis. This study evaluates five different models on the BraTS 2023 dataset, focusing on the quality of prompts. SAM and SAM 2 show promising Dice scores up to 0.894 and 0.893, respectively, with highly accurate bounding box prompts. However, nnU-Net remains the top performer due to practicality concerns. Fine-tuning the models on the pediatrics dataset improves point prompt performance but does not surpass bounding boxes or nnU-Net. Overall, while SAM and SAM 2 exhibit strong segmentation performance with precise prompts, nnU-Net remains the preferred choice for medical image segmentation due to its overall reliability and practicality. Further research on improving point prompt performance through fine-tuning is suggested for future investigations. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset. This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS 2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893, respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input representations for gestures.

<div> Keywords: Super-resolution, diffusion models, vision-language models, trustworthiness score, semantic correctness <br>
Summary: 
- The paper introduces a framework for identifying the most trustworthy super-resolution sample from a diffusion-generated set using vision-language models (VLMs).
- VLMs such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4o are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence.
- The top-ranked SR candidates selected by VLMs are ensembled to produce a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner.
- A Trustworthiness Score (TWS) metric is proposed to quantify SR reliability based on semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity.
- Empirical results demonstrate that TWS correlates strongly with human preference and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

Summary:<br>
Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) tackles the challenge of generalizing to new data without sufficient labels. Existing methods often struggle due to limited labeled data, prompting the development of SSDG techniques that incorporate regularization. FixCLR is a novel approach inspired by self-supervised learning, focusing on explicit domain invariance regularization through class information and a repelling term. It can enhance the performance of existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods. The study includes comprehensive experiments, exploring various improvements to semi-supervised techniques, comparing pretrained and non-pretrained models, and testing on multi-domain datasets. FixCLR demonstrates effectiveness in SSDG, especially when combined with other semi-supervised approaches. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available. Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.

<br>
Summary: Contrastive learning is crucial for self-supervised pretraining in foundation models, but extending it to pixel-wise representation for medical vision has been a challenge. Standard contrastive learning can lead to over-dispersion issues, breaking pixel-wise feature correlations. This study introduces a novel approach called COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework, which reformulates contrastive learning as a vector regression problem. This new framework quantifies dispersion in pixel-wise pretraining by modeling feature distances through regressing displacement vectors. COVER enables a consistent optimization flow and leverages a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, preserving pixel-wise feature correlations in self-supervised pretraining. Experimental results across different tasks and modalities demonstrate that COVER significantly enhances pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining, advancing the development of generalizable medical visual foundation models. <br> <div>

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem, breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem, enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks, spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications, accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the original dataset.

<div> Keywords: monocular depth estimation, cue-aware pipeline, cortical hierarchy, working-memory module, adaptive-bins transformer

Summary:
ThirdEye is a novel approach to monocular depth estimation that leverages explicit monocular cues through a cue-aware pipeline. Traditional methods rely on implicit learning from RGB pixels, while ThirdEye supplies cues such as occlusion boundaries and shading through pre-trained networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy with a working-memory module that weights them based on reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer then produces high-resolution disparity maps. By utilizing frozen cue experts, ThirdEye benefits from external supervision and requires minimal fine-tuning. The approach is motivated by neuroscience and aims to enhance depth estimation accuracy by incorporating key visual cues deliberately. Additional architectural details and experimental protocols are provided in this extended version of the work. <div>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will appear in a future revision.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Summary: <br>
The paper presents a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent designed to tackle complex multi-turn image editing tasks. Combining high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with accurate tool-use and local A$^*$ search, the agent aims to find a cost-efficient toolpath for image editing. By utilizing inductive reasoning on successful toolpaths, the agent continuously refines subroutines and reuses them for future tasks, resulting in an adaptive fast-slow planning approach.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$ search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$ search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$ search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.

Summary:
M2SFormer is a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to improve image forgery localization. Unlike existing methods, M2SFormer integrates multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection to capture diverse forgery artifacts. It also utilizes a global prior map and a difficulty-guided attention module to address the loss of fine detail during upsampling and preserve subtle manipulations effectively.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across unseen domains.

<div> Keywords: Skinning, Rigging, Physics-based, Soft-body, Articulated object modeling

Summary: 

PhysRig is a new physics-based skinning and rigging framework that addresses the limitations of traditional Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) techniques. It embeds a rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation and simulates it as a deformable soft-body structure using continuum mechanics. By discretizing the object as particles in an Eulerian background grid, the method ensures differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion. The introduction of material prototypes helps reduce the learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset from diverse object categories and motion patterns shows that PhysRig outperforms LBS-based approaches, producing more realistic and physically plausible results. The framework is versatile and applicable in tasks like pose transfer, demonstrating its potential for articulated object modeling. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh), which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion. Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object modeling.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach, HST-CSLR, for continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) that efficiently combines gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. By leveraging textual information from large language models, the HST-CSLR method aligns visual and textual modalities using a hierarchical sub-action tree structure to reduce computational complexity. A contrastive alignment enhancement is also applied to bridge the gap between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HST-CSLR approach in improving CSLR performance. <div>

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities. However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity. Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Summary: Pathology is rapidly evolving with digital transformation, integrating whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence. However, existing models lack integration of natural language instruction and text-based context. To address these limitations, PathChat+ is introduced, a multimodal large language model tailored for human pathology. Trained on vast pathology-specific data, it outperforms previous models on diverse benchmarks. SlideSeek, an AI system utilizing PathChat+, autonomously evaluates whole-slide images through diagnostic reasoning, achieving high accuracy on a challenging open-ended benchmark.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Summary:
DFVEdit introduces an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. By operating directly on clean latents through flow transformation, the need for attention modification and fine-tuning is eliminated. The method unifies editing and sampling under the continuous flow perspective, utilizing the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) for unbiased estimation and integrating Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance and Embedding Reinforcement (ER) for enhanced editing quality. DFVEdit offers significant practical efficiency improvements, with a 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction compared to traditional editing methods.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.

<div> Age accuracy, identity preservation, two-pass framework, adaptive noise injection, identity-aware embeddings

Summary:
The paper introduces Cradle2Cane, a two-pass face aging framework that addresses the Age-ID trade-off by balancing age accuracy and identity preservation. The first pass focuses on age accuracy through adaptive noise injection guided by textual conditions, allowing for stronger age transformations. The second pass enhances identity preservation using identity-aware embeddings, resulting in stronger identity consistency without compromising aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset demonstrate that Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in terms of age accuracy and identity consistency. <div>
arXiv:2506.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach for representing scenes from multi-view images by addressing inherent photometric distortions in camera imaging. By jointly optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, a full photometric model is introduced to effectively separate scene-unrelated information from the 3D scene representation. A depth regularization is also implemented during the optimization process to prevent the fitting of irrelevant information. The proposed method constructs a complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the method produces high-quality 3D scene representations, even in scenarios with imaging degradation like vignetting and dirt.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods. Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DREAMXFAR/SP-Ctrl.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets. Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically, we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces TSDASeg, a novel Two-Stage model for interactive point cloud Segmentation. It addresses the issue of underperformance in point-level tasks by incorporating a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module. The direct cross-modal alignment module establishes alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image data, improving the linking of local 3D features with textual context. The memory module utilizes separate memory banks to store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal correspondence mappings, which are dynamically leveraged to update scene-specific features. This approach effectively improves interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experimental results on various datasets show that TSDASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method inspired by traditional Foley workflows. This method sequentially produces individual audio tracks that correspond to specific sound events in a given video. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This approach leverages the concept of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. The training framework eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, enabling training on more accessible data. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis compared to existing baselines. <div>

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives; however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting (DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly. This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training, SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical application scenarios. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Joey-Qi/SAIC.

Summary:<br>
Scene text removal (STR) is a technique used to erase textual elements from images, with applications ranging from privacy concerns to editing typographic images. This study explores Inverse STR (ISTR) as a method to analyze STR-processed images, focusing on binary classification of whether an image has undergone STR and localizing removed text regions. The experiments show that these tasks can be achieved with high accuracy, enabling the detection of potential misuse of STR and improving its effectiveness. Additionally, efforts are made to recover the removed text content by training a text recognizer, shedding light on the challenges involved in this process. The study highlights the importance of understanding and monitoring the use of STR techniques for various applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems. However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory compliance.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel deep learning framework, FFCL-SAM, to improve intraoperative margin assessment in lumpectomy for breast cancer treatment. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), the framework achieves a high AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity for margin segmentation compared to baseline models. The pre-training strategy using FFCL enables efficient patch-level classification of specimen radiography images, leading to faster and more accurate margin assessment. The framework's speed of 47 milliseconds per image and improved segmentation accuracy offer promising potential to reduce re-excision rates and enhance surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. The code for FFCL-SAM is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

Summary:
The article introduces the Aging Multiverse framework that generates multiple plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, considering external factors like environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike previous methods that view aging as a single deterministic path, this approach creates an aging tree that showcases diverse potential futures. A training-free diffusion-based method is proposed to balance identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control, with attention mixing to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to stabilize edits. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate superior performance in terms of identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment compared to existing editing and age-progression models. By transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable process, this approach paves the way for new possibilities in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Summary:
Augmented reality (AR) offers a solution for visualizing missing view samples in novel view synthesis without the need for 3D annotations. Instead of tasking users with aligning AR displays to take images, a new approach is proposed using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors for removal by inserting new views. This method reduces mental demand on users and allows for exploration of larger scenes, such as in 3D Gaussian splatting for radiance field reconstruction. The error-peaking visualization is found to be less invasive, leading to fewer disappointments in final results. Results from a mobile view synthesis system demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing satisfactory outcomes with fewer view samples. This innovative method has the potential to advance the field of novel view synthesis and contribute to the reconstruction of larger scenes in AR applications.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

<div> Keywords: Video quality assessment, Large multimodal models, Instruction tuning, Score-based Instruction Generation, S2I dataset

Summary:
Classical video quality assessment methods often provide a numerical score that may not capture the various dimensions of video quality. To address this limitation, a new approach leverages large multimodal models and instruction tuning to assess video quality. This method, known as Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG), generates instruction-response pairs for videos, allowing for a more detailed evaluation of quality dimensions. By scoring multiple quality dimensions and incorporating a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought model, the approach mimics human reasoning and improves data scalability and generation efficiency. The resulting dataset, S2I, contains over 320K instruction-response pairs, enabling progressive tuning of video LMMs to enhance quality scoring and justification capabilities. A benchmark, S2I-Bench, is also introduced to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs using open-ended questions. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in quality scoring and justification across multiple video LMMs. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability. Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue. The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline. Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.

Summary:<br><br>
Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) addresses the challenge of data heterogeneity in federated learning by utilizing intra-client semantically meaningful knowledge. The proposed method constructs relational and consistent prototypes at the semantic level to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge. FedSC employs inter-contrastive learning to bring instance embeddings closer to relational prototypes with similar semantics and away from distinct classes. It also incorporates consistent prototypes through discrepancy aggregation as a regularization penalty to enhance model optimization. Theoretical analysis ensures the convergence guarantee of FedSC. Experimental results show the effectiveness of FedSC in various scenarios, highlighting the importance of its components for improved performance in federated learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g., fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner, as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in skin disease detection due to data imbalance and privacy concerns, highlighting the importance of data augmentation. It introduces a novel classical-quantum GAN approach for generating color medical images, surpassing traditional GANs and existing hybrid models in image quality and classification performance improvement. The model demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art classical generative models but with significantly fewer parameters and training epochs. The study indicates a promising future for quantum image generation with advancements in quantum hardware. Additionally, the model's robust performance on an IBM quantum machine with hardware noise showcases its practical applicability. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.

Summary: The paper introduces a multimodal prompt alignment framework (MPA-FER) for improving facial expression recognition (FER) using vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. The framework addresses the challenge of capturing fine-grained textual-visual relationships in FER tasks by generating detailed descriptions for each facial expression using a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT. This external knowledge is incorporated into the prompted visual features by minimizing feature discrepancy between soft and hard prompts. The framework also includes prototype-guided visual feature alignment to preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model and a cross-modal global-local alignment module to focus on expression-relevant facial features. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods on three FER benchmark datasets, maintaining the benefits of the pretrained model and reducing computational costs. <br> <div>

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features at both global and local levels based on attention information from different modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation. Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents. By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects. First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss. Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Summary:<br>
Detectors often face challenges due to domain gaps between training and testing data. This research introduces a new approach that leverages diffusion models to address domain generalization and adaptation tasks more effectively. By extracting features from a single-step diffusion process, a significant reduction in inference time is achieved while improving performance on source domains. An object-centered auxiliary branch focuses on extracting robust and domain-invariant features, enhancing object detection. Consistency loss helps align the auxiliary and ordinary branches, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting. Through feature-level and object-level alignment, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors, improving cross-domain detection performance. This method shows competitive results on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. By utilizing diffusion models, valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains are provided. <div>

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object. We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on 3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

Summary:
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) is introduced to enhance faithfulness in image editing while maintaining editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to preserve input image information and a scheduling strategy to balance editability and faithfulness. Experimental results show that FGS improves faithfulness without sacrificing editability, leading to high-quality image edits. FGS is compatible with various editing methods, allowing for precise and dynamic image manipulation across different tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs. Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts.

Summary: 
A new task called "Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching" (RoI-Matching) is introduced to allow for flexible and efficient matching of customized regions in documents. The RoI-Matching-Bench benchmark is created to evaluate matching difficulty levels, and the RoI-Matcher framework is proposed using a siamese network and cross-attention layers for feature extraction and alignment. The model demonstrates effectiveness in matching regions in documents and can serve as a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions, such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient, multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/RoI-Matching.

Summary: 
SAMURAI is a novel framework proposed for the challenging task of retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a 2D image and a natural language description. The ROOMELSA challenge, which limits access to full 3D scene context, poses various difficulties such as distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. SAMURAI addresses these challenges by integrating CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes of masked regions and a robust majority voting strategy. A preprocessing pipeline is used to enhance mask quality by extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. By leveraging both language and shape cues, SAMURAI achieves competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set, emphasizing the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding for effective 3D object retrieval.

Summary:
PoseMaster is a novel framework for efficient 3D character modeling that integrates pose transformation and character generation into a unified flow-based system. By utilizing 3D body bones as pose conditions and incorporating multi-condition control, PoseMaster enables accurate arbitrary-pose control, surpassing current methods in both quality and precision. The framework also addresses issues of self-occlusion and viewpoint distortion that can affect image quality, by training on a high-quality pose-control dataset derived from realistic character animation data. With its ability to learn implicit relationships between skeleton structure and skinning weights, PoseMaster demonstrates superior performance in generating A-pose characters with precise control for arbitrary poses. <div>
arXiv:2506.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary poses.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of developing real-time deep learning-based stereo matching models for accurate disparity estimation in computer vision. It highlights the trade-off between large-scale cost volumes with redundant information and computationally heavy processing units, and small-scale cost volumes with limited information but better real-time performance. To bridge this gap, the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) is proposed to mitigate information loss in small-scale cost volumes by integrating primary features into the disparity upsampling unit. ESM leverages feature extraction, shuffling, layer splitting, and feature-guided hourglass network for detailed scene geometry recovery. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large receptive field and low computational cost, enabling highly accurate disparity map reconstruction at real-time speeds.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework called OracleFusion to decipher undeciphered Oracle Bone Script (OBS) characters by analyzing glyph structure and generating semantically enriched vector fonts. The framework consists of two stages - the first stage utilizes the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze glyph structure, while the second stage employs Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF) to generate semantically enriched vector fonts. The framework outperforms existing models in terms of semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, enhancing both readability and aesthetic quality of OBS characters. The experiments show that OracleFusion provides expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for advancing the decipherment of OBS. <div>

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters, only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF), incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for advancing the decipherment of OBS.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI. As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse & nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration. Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/SIED.

<title>YOLO-FDA: Integrating Hierarchical Attention and Detail Enhancement for Surface Defect Detection</title>

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures. Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance, existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion. Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM) that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and scales.

<title>Tree-based Semantic Losses: Application to Sparsely-supervised Large Multi-class Hyperspectral Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications, offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However, commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior, perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

<title>Topology-Aware Modeling for Unsupervised Simulation-to-Reality Point Cloud Recognition</title>

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust, domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

<title>Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21184</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2506.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/7uHeng/OccOoD.

<title>GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding</title>

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yihong-97/UNLOCK.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of 2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall, MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

<title>BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

Abstract: This paper presents ESFP, an end-to-end pipeline that converts monocular RGB video into executable joint trajectories for a low-cost 4-DoF desktop arm. ESFP comprises four sequential modules. (1) Estimating: ROMP lifts each frame to a 24-joint 3-D skeleton. (2) Smoothing: the proposed HPSTM-a sequence-to-sequence Transformer with self-attention-combines long-range temporal context with a differentiable forward-kinematics decoder, enforcing constant bone lengths and anatomical plausibility while jointly predicting joint means and full covariances. (3) Filtering: root-normalized trajectories are variance-weighted according to HPSTM's uncertainty estimates, suppressing residual noise. (4) Pose-Mapping: a geometric retargeting layer transforms shoulder-elbow-wrist triples into the uArm's polar workspace, preserving wrist orientation.

<title>DiMPLe -- Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning: Enhancing Out-Of-Distribution Alignment with Invariant and Spurious Feature Separation</title>

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization, and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering ($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

<title>DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic</title>

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.

<title>Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter</title>

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image (T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs, directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information. To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation. Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS, while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting. This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at: https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/CoSMAE.

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA) systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at https://github.com/kasuba-badri-vishal/DhrishtiKon.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for human-centric visual understanding.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available after paper acceptance.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images. Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions. We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS. Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce \textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct \textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene. Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge, symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8 DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem, which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid annotation.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

<title>FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2) anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression. For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes (pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task. In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset, HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two 3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in this paper in this github repository: https://github.com/DeepMicroscopy/AMi-Br_Benchmark.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for future research in this critical safety application.

<title>Rethinking Oversaturation in Classifier-Free Guidance via Low Frequency</title>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL, Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at https://vishu26.github.io/RCME/index.html.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source (easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7 percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.

<title>Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/rAIson-Lab/G2D.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting. However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg} car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs. Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/WAFT.

<title>Maximal Matching Matters: Preventing Representation Collapse for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without relying on external data.

<title>StruMamba3D: Exploring Structural Mamba for Self-supervised Point Cloud Representation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21541</link>

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits. First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy.

<title>DeOcc-1-to-3: 3D De-Occlusion from a Single Image via Self-Supervised Multi-View Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21544</link>

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge, especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image, enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at https://github.com/Quyans/DeOcc123.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction. Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA), which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets, spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume. Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.

<title>Global and Local Contrastive Learning for Joint Representations from Cardiac MRI and ECG</title>

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at: https://github.com/alsalivan/ecgcmr

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized, significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier points as valid conductors measurements.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available on our project page: https://c-he.github.io/projects/3dgh/.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra. The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by 26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra. The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to 1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them. However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of real-world objects.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images. Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the baseline. This scalable method minimizes the dependency on fully annotated data, paving the way for practical real-world applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings, character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful, narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at https://github.com/GVCLab/FairyGen

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences, anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors, generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research paper.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present \textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets. Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme, enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based denoising methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution

Abstract: While the integration of transformers in vision models have yielded significant improvements on vision tasks they still require significant amounts of computation for both training and inference. Restricted attention mechanisms significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to attend to multiple receptive fields.
  We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets.

Abstract: As a natural disaster, landslide often brings tremendous losses to human lives, so it urgently demands reliable detection of landslide risks. When detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to 0.565.

Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion models is still hindered by the high memory and computational overhead. Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: Neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning sequences of tasks or data streams, unlike humans who can continuously learn and consolidate new concepts even in the absence of explicit cues. Online data-incremental learning seeks to emulate this capability by processing each sample only once, without having access to task or stream cues at any point in time since this is more realistic compared to offline setups, where all data from novel class(es) is assumed to be readily available. However, existing methods typically rely on storing the subsets of data in memory or expanding the initial model architecture, resulting in significant computational overhead. Drawing inspiration from 'self-regulated neurogenesis'-brain's mechanism for creating specialized regions or circuits for distinct functions-we propose a novel approach SERENA which encodes each concept in a specialized network path called 'concept cell', integrated into a single over-parameterized network. Once a concept is learned, its corresponding concept cell is frozen, effectively preventing the forgetting of previously acquired information. Furthermore, we introduce two new continual learning scenarios that more closely reflect real-world conditions, characterized by gradually changing sample sizes. Experimental results show that our method not only establishes new state-of-the-art results across ten benchmarks but also remarkably surpasses offline supervised batch learning performance. The code is available at https://github.com/muratonuryildirim/serena.

Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics, current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency and the ability to reconstruct lineage trees correctly. To address this issue, we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for motion estimation frameworks and extend the multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Our uncertainty estimation lifts motion representations into probabilistic spatial densities using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Moreover, we introduce a novel mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation that allows multi-hypothesis trackers to model cell splits and to resolve false associations and mitosis detections based on long-term conflicts. In our framework, explicit biological knowledge is modeled in assignment costs. We evaluate our approach on nine competitive datasets and demonstrate that we outperform the current state-of-the-art on biologically inspired metrics substantially, achieving improvements by a factor of approximately 6 and uncover new insights into the behavior of motion estimation uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has become an essential method for building foundational visual models in remote sensing (RS). However, the limitations in size and diversity of existing RS datasets restrict the ability of MIM methods to learn generalizable representations. Additionally, conventional MIM techniques, which require reconstructing all tokens, introduce unnecessary computational overhead. To address these issues, we present a new pre-training pipeline for RS models, featuring the creation of a large-scale RS dataset and an efficient MIM approach. We curated a high-quality dataset named \textbf{OpticalRS-13M} by collecting publicly available RS datasets and processing them through exclusion, slicing, and deduplication. OpticalRS-13M comprises 13 million optical images covering various RS tasks, such as object detection and pixel segmentation. To enhance efficiency, we propose \textbf{SelectiveMAE}, a pre-training method that dynamically encodes and reconstructs semantically rich patch tokens, thereby reducing the inefficiencies of traditional MIM models caused by redundant background pixels in RS images. Extensive experiments show that OpticalRS-13M significantly improves classification, detection, and segmentation performance, while SelectiveMAE increases training efficiency over 2$\times$ times. This highlights the effectiveness and scalability of our pipeline in developing RS foundational models. The dataset, source code, and trained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/SelectiveMAE.

Abstract: We introduce Canonical Consolidation Fields (CanFields). This novel method interpolates arbitrary-length sequences of independently sampled 3D point clouds into a unified, continuous, and coherent deforming shape. Unlike prior methods that oversmooth geometry or produce topological and geometric artifacts, CanFields optimizes fine-detailed geometry and deformation jointly in an unsupervised fitting with two novel bespoke modules. First, we introduce a dynamic consolidator module that adjusts the input and assigns confidence scores, balancing the optimization of the canonical shape and its motion. Second, we represent the motion as a diffeomorphic flow parameterized by a smooth velocity field. We have validated our robustness and accuracy on more than 50 diverse sequences, demonstrating its superior performance even with missing regions, noisy raw scans, and sparse data.

Abstract: To efficiently deploy strong, often pre-trained feature extractors, recent Industrial Anomaly Detection and Segmentation (IADS) methods process low-resolution images, e.g., 224x224 pixels, obtained by downsampling the original input images. However, while numerous industrial applications demand the identification of both large and small defects, downsampling the input image to a low resolution may hinder a method's ability to pinpoint tiny anomalies. We propose a novel Teacher--Student paradigm to leverage strong pre-trained features while processing high-resolution input images very efficiently. The core idea concerns training two shallow MLPs (the Students) by nominal images so as to mimic the mappings between the patch embeddings induced by the self-attention layers of a frozen vision Transformer (the Teacher). Indeed, learning these mappings sets forth a challenging pretext task that small-capacity models are unlikely to accomplish on out-of-distribution data such as anomalous images. Our method can spot anomalies from high-resolution images and runs way faster than competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and the best segmentation results on VisA. We also propose novel evaluation metrics to capture robustness to defect size, i.e., the ability to preserve good localisation from large anomalies to tiny ones. Evaluating our method also by these metrics reveals its neatly superior performance.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents unique challenges that extend beyond traditional short-video analysis approaches, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies, processing redundant information efficiently, and extracting high-level semantic concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries is essential for effective crop monitoring and resource management. However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent global transferability and robustness. Crucially, our approach significantly simplifies data preparation workflows by reliably processing cloud-affected imagery, thereby offering strong adaptability across diverse agricultural environments. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/feevos/tfcl.

Abstract: In this paper, we highlight a critical yet often overlooked factor in most 3D human tasks, namely modeling complicated 3D human with with hand-held objects or loose-fitting clothing. It is known that the parameterized formulation of SMPL is able to fit human skin; while hand-held objects and loose-fitting clothing, are difficult to get modeled within the unified framework, since their movements are usually decoupled with the human body. To enhance the capability of SMPL skeleton in response to this situation, we propose a growth strategy that enables the joint tree of the skeleton to expand adaptively. Specifically, our method, called ToMiE, consists of parent joints localization and external joints optimization. For parent joints localization, we employ a gradient-based approach guided by both LBS blending weights and motion kernels. Once the external joints are obtained, we proceed to optimize their transformations in SE(3) across different frames, enabling rendering and explicit animation. ToMiE manages to outperform other methods across various cases with hand-held objects and loose-fitting clothing, not only in rendering quality but also by offering free animation of grown joints, thereby enhancing the expressive ability of SMPL skeleton for a broader range of applications.

Abstract: Vision-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) 3D object detection has recently become popular in autonomous driving. However, objects with a high similarity to the background from a camera perspective cannot be detected well by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a BEV-based 3D Object Detection Network with 2D Region-Oriented Attention (ROA-BEV), which enables the backbone to focus more on feature learning of the regions where objects exist. Moreover, our method further enhances the information feature learning ability of ROA through multi-scale structures. Each block of ROA utilizes a large kernel to ensure that the receptive field is large enough to catch information about large objects. Experiments on nuScenes show that ROA-BEV improves the performance based on BEVDepth. The source codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/DFLyan/ROA-BEV.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.

Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator has established itself in the field of non-rigid shape analysis due to its many useful properties such as being invariant under isometric transformation, having a countable eigensystem forming an orthornormal basis, and fully characterizing geodesic distances of the manifold. However, this invariancy only applies under isometric deformations, which leads to a performance breakdown in many real-world applications. In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal features using deep learning methods,however spectral signatures play a crucial role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold. Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and correspondence, proving the adaption of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and highly local learning settings.

Abstract: Open-set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where novel classes - also referred to as target-private unknown classes - are present. Source-free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source data, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However, SF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the introduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on thresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a known or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features for the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a novel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly learning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage process. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by synthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the classifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt the entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and distinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain adaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our framework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA methods.

Abstract: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional paradigm of designing task-specific models, offering greater scalability across multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced TansfoRmer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention is proposed to synthesize diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views effectively. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) is devised to retrieve the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as the fundamental building blocks of both modules, which exhibit superior parameter efficiency and reduced spectral bias to better capture high-frequency components critical for CT interpretation while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548 K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across almost all metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/xiweideng/MvKeTR.

Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.

Abstract: We present InfiniCube, a scalable method for generating unbounded dynamic 3D driving scenes with high fidelity and controllability. Previous methods for scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings.

Abstract: Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder, optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily adapted to other tasks. To demonstrate its versatility, we conduct experiments on both instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/mrdetr/

<title>Rethinking Detecting Salient and Camouflaged Objects in Unconstrained Scenes</title>

Abstract: While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient and camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks. Specifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify camouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models conversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that this can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of current SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit attribute relationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a mutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or camouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore, current SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained datasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained salient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset, USC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that cover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged objects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt query mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample attribute relationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish between salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called CSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenes in various metrics. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/ssecv/USCNet.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have demonstrated the potential of using 3D Gaussian primitives for high-speed, high-fidelity, and cost-efficient novel view synthesis from continuously calibrated input views. However, conventional methods require high-frame-rate dense and high-quality sharp images, which are time-consuming and inefficient to capture, especially in dynamic environments. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for dynamic practical applications.

Abstract: Achieving physically consistent image editing remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Existing image editing methods typically rely on neural networks, which struggle to accurately handle shadows and refractions. Conversely, physics-based inverse rendering often requires multi-view optimization, limiting its practicality in single-image scenarios. In this paper, we propose Materialist, a method combining a learning-based approach with physically based progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. Our approach enables a range of applications, including material editing, object insertion, and relighting, while also introducing an effective method for editing material transparency without requiring full scene geometry. Furthermore, Our envmap estimation method also achieves state-of-the-art performance, further enhancing the accuracy of image editing task. Experiments demonstrate strong performance across synthetic and real-world datasets, excelling even on challenging out-of-domain images. Project website: https://lez-s.github.io/materialist_project/

<title>DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Motion deblurring addresses the challenge of image blur caused by camera or scene movement. Event cameras provide motion information that is encoded in the asynchronous event streams. To efficiently leverage the temporal information of event streams, we employ Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for motion feature extraction and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for color information processing. Due to the non-uniform distribution and inherent redundancy of event data, existing cross-modal feature fusion methods exhibit certain limitations. Inspired by the visual attention mechanism in the human visual system, this study introduces a bioinspired dual-drive hybrid network (BDHNet). Specifically, the Neuron Configurator Module (NCM) is designed to dynamically adjusts neuron configurations based on cross-modal features, thereby focusing the spikes in blurry regions and adapting to varying blurry scenarios dynamically. Additionally, the Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) is introduced to generate a blurry mask in an unsupervised manner, effectively extracting motion clues from the event features and guiding more accurate cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

Abstract: Current image captioning systems lack the ability to link descriptive text to specific visual elements, making their outputs difficult to verify. While recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking. We present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and the segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B on GroundCap. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic lip movements and facial expressions for 3D head models from arbitrary audio clips. Although existing diffusion-based methods are capable of producing natural motions, their slow generation speed limits their application potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel autoregressive model that achieves real-time generation of highly synchronized lip movements and realistic head poses and eye blinks by learning a mapping from speech to a multi-scale motion codebook. Furthermore, our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles, enabling the creation of 3D talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during training. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in lip synchronization accuracy and perceived quality.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of digitalization, various document images are being applied more extensively in production and daily life, and there is an increasingly urgent need for fast and accurate parsing of the content in document images. Therefore, this report presents PP-DocBee, a novel multimodal large language model designed for end-to-end document image understanding. First, we develop a data synthesis strategy tailored to document scenarios in which we build a diverse dataset to improve the model generalization. Then, we apply a few training techniques, including dynamic proportional sampling, data preprocessing, and OCR postprocessing strategies. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of PP-DocBee, achieving state-of-the-art results on English document understanding benchmarks and even outperforming existing open source and commercial models in Chinese document understanding.

Abstract: Low-light and underwater videos suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and high noise, necessitating enhancements in visual quality. However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.

Abstract: We present AnyCalib, a method for calibrating the intrinsic parameters of a camera from a single in-the-wild image, that is agnostic to the camera model. Current methods are predominantly tailored to specific camera models and/or require extrinsic cues, such as the direction of gravity, to be visible in the image. In contrast, we argue that the perspective and distortion cues inherent in images are sufficient for model-agnostic camera calibration. To demonstrate this, we frame the calibration process as the regression of the rays corresponding to each pixel. We show, for the first time, that this intermediate representation allows for a closed-form recovery of the intrinsics for a wide range of camera models, including but not limited to: pinhole, Brown-Conrady and Kannala-Brandt. Our approach also applies to edited -- cropped and stretched -- images. Experimentally, we demonstrate that AnyCalib consistently outperforms alternative methods, including 3D foundation models, despite being trained on orders of magnitude less data. Code is available at https://github.com/javrtg/AnyCalib.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration often faces computational bottlenecks and information loss due to its extremely high resolution. Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.

Abstract: Crop yield estimation is a relevant problem in agriculture, because an accurate yield estimate can support farmers' decisions on harvesting or precision intervention. Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset is publicly available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/hops/. The open-source implementation of our approach is available at https://github.com/PRBonn/hapt3D.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, a lack of data has become a major obstacle to enhancing perception model accuracy. Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios. All the data and code will be available at https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/SimWorld.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation from RGB cameras is essential to the perception of autonomous flying vehicles. The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency.

Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.

Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates how a popular Text-to-Image (T2I) model represents people from 208 different nationalities when prompted to generate images of individuals engaging in typical activities. Two scenarios were developed, and 644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities. The results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other, 27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and regions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain areas, particularly the Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320 prompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario. The study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word "traditional" was added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings provide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across different countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes traditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given activities.

Abstract: This work investigates the internal training dynamics of image restoration~(IR) Transformers and uncovers a critical yet overlooked issue: conventional LayerNorm leads feature magnitude divergence, up to a million scale, and collapses channel-wise entropy. We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.

Abstract: Recognizing geometric features on B-rep models is a cornerstone technique for multimedia content-based retrieval and has been widely applied in intelligent manufacturing. However, previous research often merely focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards, BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000 B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF datasets.

Abstract: Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing 3D SNNs have struggled with long-range dependencies until the recent emergence of Mamba, which offers superior computational efficiency and sequence modeling capability. In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs. Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art SNN models, SPM improves OA by +6.2%, +6.1%, and +7.4% on three variants of ScanObjectNN, and boosts instance mIOU by +1.9% on ShapeNetPart. Meanwhile, its energy consumption is at least 3.5x lower than that of its ANN counterpart. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We focus on the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem, when source data is unavailable during adaptation, and the model must adapt to the unlabeled target domain. In medical imaging, several approaches have leveraged a semi-supervised student-teacher architecture to bridge domain discrepancy. Context imbalance in labeled training data and significant domain shifts between domains can lead to biased teacher models that produce inaccurate pseudolabels, degrading the student model's performance and causing a mode collapse. Class imbalance, particularly when one class significantly outnumbers another, leads to contextual bias. To tackle the problem of context bias and the significant performance drop of the student model in the SFOD setting, we introduce Grounded Teacher (GT) as a standard framework. In this study, we model contextual relationships using a dedicated relational context module and leverage it to mitigate inherent biases in the model. This approach enables us to apply augmentations to closely related classes, across and within domains, enhancing the performance of underrepresented classes while keeping the effect on dominant classes minimal. We further improve the quality of predictions by implementing an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating context bias under the SFOD setting through experiments on three medical datasets supported by comprehensive ablation studies. All relevant resources, including preprocessed data, trained model weights, and code, are publicly available at this https://github.com/Tajamul21/Grounded_Teacher.

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

Abstract: World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on only a few recent observations leads them to lose track of the long-term context. Consequently, in just a few steps the generated scenes drift from what was previously observed, undermining the temporal coherence of the sequence. This limitation of the state-of-the-art world models, most of which rely on diffusion, comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address this problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is enabled to perform long-context tasks by integrating features from a state-space model, representing the entire interaction history. This design restores long-term memory while preserving the high-fidelity synthesis of diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment. These results establish that bringing state-space representations into diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and long-term memory.

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from a gallery of images based on a natural language description. It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video, depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction, enabling systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from temporally-aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction, egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric video, and also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project page: https://egom2p.github.io/.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) are the subject of extensive research, particularly in their application to modeling complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal coordinates to corresponding values. When handling videos, mapping compact inputs to entire frames or spatially partitioned patch images is an effective approach. This strategy better preserves spatial relationships, reduces computational overhead, and improves reconstruction quality compared to coordinate-based mapping. However, predicting entire frames often limits the reconstruction of high-frequency visual details. Additionally, conventional patch-based approaches based on uniform spatial partitioning tend to introduce boundary discontinuities that degrade spatial coherence. We propose a neural video representation method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs) to address such limitations. Our method separates each video frame into patch images of spatially aligned frames through a deterministic pixel-based splitting similar to PixelUnshuffle. This operation preserves the global spatial structure while allowing patch-level decoding. We train the decoder to reconstruct these structured patches, enabling a global-to-local decoding strategy that captures the global layout first and refines local details. This effectively reduces boundary artifacts and mitigates distortions from naive upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher reconstruction quality and better compression performance than existing INR-based baselines.

<title>PuriDefense: Randomized Local Implicit Adversarial Purification for Defending Black-box Query-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: Black-box query-based attacks constitute significant threats to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems since they can generate adversarial examples without accessing the target model's architecture and parameters. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformations, either impose substantial computational costs or compromise the test accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, PuriDefense, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models at a low level of inference cost. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks by incorporating randomness into purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against query-based attacks.

<title>Enhancing Dynamic CT Image Reconstruction with Neural Fields and Optical Flow</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate image reconstruction for dynamic Computed Tomography. The motion of the target with respect to the measurement acquisition rate leads to highly resolved in time but highly undersampled in space measurements. Such problems pose a major challenge: not accounting for the dynamics of the process leads to a poor reconstruction with non-realistic motion. Variational approaches that penalize time evolution have been proposed to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality based on classical grid-based discretizations. Neural fields have emerged as a novel way to parameterize the quantity of interest using a neural network with a low-dimensional input, benefiting from being lightweight, continuous, and biased towards smooth representations. The latter property has been exploited when solving dynamic inverse problems with neural fields by minimizing a data-fidelity term only. We investigate and show the benefits of introducing explicit motion regularizers for dynamic inverse problems based on partial differential equations, namely, the optical flow equation, for the optimization of neural fields. We compare it against its unregularized counterpart and show the improvements in the reconstruction. We also compare neural fields against a grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter in terms of PSNR in this task.

Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants.

<title>GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs</title>

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.

<title>Moderating the Generalization of Score-based Generative Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07229</link>

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.

<title>Discovering Global False Negatives On the Fly for Self-supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20612</link>

arXiv:2502.20612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset, excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives", leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery, our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND.

arXiv:2503.03921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CREStE, a scalable learning-based mapless navigation framework to address the open-world generalization and robustness challenges of outdoor urban navigation. Key to achieving this is learning perceptual representations that generalize to open-set factors (e.g. novel semantic classes, terrains, dynamic entities) and inferring expert-aligned navigation costs from limited demonstrations. CREStE addresses both these issues, introducing 1) a visual foundation model (VFM) distillation objective for learning open-set structured bird's-eye-view perceptual representations, and 2) counterfactual inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a novel active learning formulation that uses counterfactual trajectory demonstrations to reason about the most important cues when inferring navigation costs. We evaluate CREStE on the task of kilometer-scale mapless navigation in a variety of city, offroad, and residential environments and find that it outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with 70% fewer human interventions, including a 2-kilometer mission in an unseen environment with just 1 intervention; showcasing its robustness and effectiveness for long-horizon mapless navigation.

Abstract: 3DGS is an emerging and increasingly popular technology in the field of novel view synthesis. Its highly realistic rendering quality and real-time rendering capabilities make it promising for various applications. However, when applied to large-scale aerial urban scenes, 3DGS methods suffer from issues such as excessive memory consumption, slow training times, prolonged partitioning processes, and significant degradation in rendering quality due to the increased data volume. To tackle these challenges, we introduce \textbf{HUG}, a novel approach that enhances data partitioning and reconstruction quality by leveraging a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We first propose a visibility-based data partitioning method that is simple yet highly efficient, significantly outperforming existing methods in speed. Then, we introduce a novel hierarchical weighted training approach, combined with other optimization strategies, to substantially improve reconstruction quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on one synthetic dataset and four real-world datasets.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

arXiv:2506.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.

<title>Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning</title>

arXiv:2506.13056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Summary:
A computer vision system was developed to track the movement of agricultural sprayer booms in real time. Neural network models were trained to quantify the boom's vertical and transverse displacement during field operations. The accuracy of the model in detecting the target on the boom was over 90 percent. An inclinometer sensor was used to validate the neural network output, with target distance estimates matching inclinometer data closely. This system can be implemented on various sprayers with minor modifications to quantify boom movement. The data obtained can be utilized to improve sprayer boom design and stability, ultimately enhancing application accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting. However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions (often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete, non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution, enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC) framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability. Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Summary: <br />
Token merging in Vision Transformers (ViT) is an effective strategy for accelerating computation, but existing methods lack spatial information integration, crucial in early ViT layers. To address this, a novel method called ToSA combines semantic and spatial awareness by utilizing depth images to generate pseudo spatial tokens. This approach enhances the token merging process and preserves critical scene structure. Experimental results show that ToSA outperforms existing methods in visual and embodied question answering benchmarks while significantly reducing ViT runtime, making it a promising solution for ViT acceleration. <div>

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging, overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT, making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited. Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR) as a method for effectively removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality. This is achieved through strategies like Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) during fine-tuning. A novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), is proposed to evaluate concept erasure in AR models using structured templates and visual classifiers. Experimental results on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro show that EAR significantly improves erasure effectiveness and preserves model utility.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility preservation.

<div> Keywords: Structured pruning, deep neural networks, automatic selection, compression, edge devices<br />
Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces a Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) method for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
- LAASP eliminates the traditional training-pruning-fine-tuning cycle, instead opting for a pruning-while-training approach to reduce the network's size.
- The selection of pruning criteria and layers for pruning is guided by the network's loss on a small subset of training data, resulting in better accuracy retention.
- To maintain accuracy after pruning, the network undergoes brief retraining at specified FLOP reduction intervals.
- Experimental results show significant improvements in top-1 accuracy for models like ResNet56 and ResNet110 on CIFAR-10, with FLOP reduction of up to 52%.

Summary: <br />
Structured pruning can compress neural networks for edge devices efficiently. The Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) method integrates pruning into the training process, guided by loss on a subset of data. This approach improves accuracy retention and eliminates abrupt drops. LAASP achieves significant accuracy improvements for models like ResNet56 and ResNet110 on CIFAR-10 by up to 52% FLOP reduction. <div>

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

Summary: 
Text-to-Image Diffusion models have revolutionized image editing tasks, but certain edits are better represented through exemplar pairs. This work addresses exemplar-based image editing using pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and VLMs. The pipeline, being optimization-free, outperforms baselines and is significantly faster, showcasing its efficiency in multiple types of edits. <div>
arXiv:2506.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

<div> benchmark, OCR hallucination, degraded document understanding, vision-faithful reasoning, GRPO-based framework

Summary:
The article introduces KIE-HVQA, a benchmark for evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. It addresses the issue of overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning in multimodal large language models when faced with visual degradation. The proposed GRPO-based framework incorporates a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and a reward mechanism to mitigate hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL show a 22% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy compared to GPT-40. This approach ensures vision-faithful reasoning and enhances the model's capacity to distinguish reliable visual information and provide accurate answers under degraded input conditions. Additionally, there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, demonstrating both effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Summary: 
This study explores the effectiveness of combining pretrained foundation models in Earth Observation tasks. The research examines the performance of models like Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA on various datasets. By ensembling smaller pretrained models at the feature level, the study demonstrates that comparable or superior performance can be achieved compared to larger models, with reduced training time and computational resources. Additionally, leveraging knowledge distillation allows for transferring the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, paving the way for practical implementation of foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications. <div>
arXiv:2506.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions, sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications.

arXiv:2506.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However, well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module (PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

arXiv:2506.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

Summary:
Event cameras and RGB cameras are commonly used together, but transmitting their data efficiently is challenging. This study introduces a transmission scheme that optimizes bandwidth usage by eliminating redundant information and utilizing Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method. The proposed joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework separates shared and domain-specific information within the inputs, ensuring compactness and informativeness. This framework also adapts bandwidth allocation based on scene dynamics, improving reconstruction quality and deblurring performance. Simulation results show that this scheme outperforms conventional systems in both reconstruction quality and deblurring effectiveness. <div>
arXiv:2506.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs. This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information. Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA) to address the challenge of developing generalizable models for surgical workflow understanding across different operating room settings. SPA utilizes few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with institution-specific scenes and phases, ensuring temporal consistency through diffusion modeling based on institutional procedure protocols. The framework also incorporates dynamic test-time adaptation to enhance reliability under distribution shifts. SPA is a lightweight framework that allows customization of phase recognition models by defining phases in natural language, annotating a few images, and providing task graphs for phase transitions. Experimental results show that SPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even surpassing full-shot models with 32 labeled data. The code for SPA is available on GitHub for public use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability, present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

<div> Keywords: handwriting recognition, offline images, online stroke data, end-to-end network, transformer

Summary:
An end-to-end network is proposed for handwriting recognition that combines offline images and online stroke data. The network performs early fusion of both modalities in a shared latent space, utilizing a patch encoder for visual tokens and a lightweight transformer for $(x, y, \text{pen})$ data. Learnable latent queries attend to both token streams, enhancing context within stroke embeddings. By integrating information before classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation learning, leading to improved writer independence. The approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB datasets, surpassing previous best results by up to 1%. Additionally, the system is adapted with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. The code for the network is available for further research and development.

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$ sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams, yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our code can be found here.

Summary:
The Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN) addresses the challenging task of few-shot fine-grained image classification by integrating dual-layer feature reconstruction and mask-enhanced feature processing. HMDRN leverages complementary visual information from different network hierarchies through a dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module. This allows the model to balance high-level semantic representations with mid-level structural details, improving classification accuracy. Additionally, a spatial binary mask-enhanced transformer self-reconstruction module enhances focus on discriminative regions and filters out background noise. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets show that HMDRN outperforms existing methods with Conv-4 and ResNet-12 backbone architectures. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component, showing that dual-layer reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination, while mask-enhanced transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results validate HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2506.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations: metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features, while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12 backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

This paper presents a novel approach using deep learning to assess textile similarity, introducing an automatic tool that evaluates canvases without relying on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained to compare canvas images by utilizing learned feature representations. A similarity estimation method aggregates predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a robust similarity score. Applied to canvases from the Museo Nacional del Prado, the approach confirms that plain weave canvases can be effectively compared, even with similar thread densities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed, aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases, widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DenseWorld, a benchmark for 25 dense prediction tasks in computer vision that reflect real-world applications. Existing methods in this field often struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios due to a lack of diverse training data. To address this challenge, DenseDiT is proposed as a unified strategy that leverages generative models' visual priors to tackle various real-world dense prediction tasks efficiently. DenseDiT, with its parameter-reuse mechanism and lightweight branches for multi-scale context integration, outperforms existing baselines, even with significantly less training data. The results highlight the practical value of DenseDiT for real-world deployment. The benchmark data, checkpoints, and codes are available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context, working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast, DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and multispectral images (MSIs). Rather than using spatial transformations for registration, the proposed approach tackles the registration problem from the spectral domain. A Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to enhance spectral resolution and a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method is used with group sparsity regularization to promote low-rankness in the images, reducing computational complexity. The Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm is employed for solving the BSF model. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the method in registration, fusion, and enhancing classification performance. <div>

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this, the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion. We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

<div> Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling, diffusion models, conditional generation, local maxima, generation quality <br />
Summary:
The article introduces Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling) as a sampling strategy to overcome local maxima in diffusion models for conditional generation. By detecting potential local maxima and reverting to previous states with noise injection, the method allows for dynamic exploration and refinement during the generation process. This approach enhances both alignment and visual quality of generated outputs. Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and compatible with existing diffusion frameworks, offering substantial improvements in generation quality with a minimal increase in function evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2506.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories, accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X increase in function evaluations.

<title>Radiomic fingerprints for knee MR images assessment</title>

<div> Keywords: knee MRI, radiomic features, deep learning, interpretability, diagnostic accuracy

Summary:
In this study, a novel radiomic fingerprint framework is proposed for accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans. Unlike traditional radiomic signatures, the radiomic fingerprints are dynamically constructed for each patient by a deep learning model, selecting relevant features from a large radiomic feature pool. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy for knee abnormalities, ACL tears, and meniscus tears compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. The framework also enhances interpretability, allowing for meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery. By training a radiomic-selecting model simultaneously with a low-dimensional logistic regression, the framework achieves comparable or superior diagnostic performance while maintaining explainability. Real-world clinical cases are analyzed to demonstrate the advantages of this approach in providing detailed clinical insights and facilitating biomarker discovery. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment, often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly, we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases to evidence these advantages.

<title>On the Burstiness of Faces in Set</title>

<div> Keywords: Burstiness, set-based face recognition, Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, generalized max-pooling (GMP)

Summary:
Burstiness is a common issue in set-based face recognition (SFR) where certain faces with specific attributes occur frequently, impacting performance in training and evaluation. To address this, three strategies based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling (GMP) are proposed to detect bursty faces in a set. By identifying bursty faces, training instances can be balanced to improve generalization to unconstrained scenarios. Additionally, quality-aware GMP is introduced to handle low-quality faces during evaluation. Experimental results on SFR benchmarks demonstrate that burstiness significantly hinders recognition performance, highlighting the importance of suppressing burstiness for enhanced recognition accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2506.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition (SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects: Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling (GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

Summary: 
This paper evaluates five state-of-the-art object detection architectures on three annotated datasets representing various levels of complexity in historical documents. The study finds that the performance of the models varies significantly depending on the dataset characteristics and bounding box representation. Co-DETR performs well on the e-NDP dataset, while YOLOv11X-OBB excels on the CATMuS and HORAE datasets, emphasizing the importance of Oriented Bounding Boxes for accurately modeling historical manuscripts. The study highlights a trade-off between the global context awareness of Transformers and the generalization ability of CNN-OBB models. Overall, the research underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate model architecture and bounding box representation for effectively analyzing complex document layouts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers (1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results (0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively). This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for visually diverse and complex documents.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our framework in generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module, which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark, outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed. The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of 69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program. High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09 m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas. This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

<div> Diffusion models; Image synthesis; Ultra-high-resolution; Zero-shot generation; Visual fidelity <br />
Summary: 
HiWave introduces a training-free, zero-shot approach to improve visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. The method includes a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model and applying a patch-wise DDIM inversion step with a wavelet-based detail enhancer module. The approach utilizes inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that maintain global coherence and a detail enhancer that retains low-frequency components for structural consistency while enhancing high-frequency components to enrich details. Evaluation using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrates HiWave's effectiveness in reducing visual artifacts and achieving superior perceptual quality. In a user study, HiWave outperformed the state-of-the-art alternative in over 80% of comparisons, showcasing its capability for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without the need for retraining or architectural changes.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis, demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free, zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures. Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points. Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques, achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground environments.

Summary:<br />
A novel AI-based deep learning framework is proposed for automatically detecting and quantifying alveolar bone loss and its patterns in intraoral periapical radiographs. The method combines YOLOv8 for tooth detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify landmarks, allowing precise bone loss severity calculation. YOLOv8x-seg models segment bone levels and tooth masks to classify bone loss patterns (horizontal vs. angular) through geometric analysis. The approach achieved high accuracy in detecting bone loss severity and pattern classification on a dataset of 1000 radiographs. This automated system provides a rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing the need for subjective manual evaluation. Integrating AI into dental radiographic analysis can enhance early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, leading to improved patient care and clinical outcomes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss, significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

<div> block effects, deepfake detection, compressed images, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models

Summary:
PLADA is a new framework designed to detect deepfakes on Online Social Networks (OSNs). It addresses the challenges posed by block effects introduced by compression in OSNs, which can obscure deepfake artifacts. The framework consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E) and Open Data Aggregation (ODA). B2E utilizes a dual-stage attention mechanism to effectively handle block effects, while ODA processes both paired and unpaired data for improved detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets show that PLADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in deepfake detection, even with limited paired data and compression. This work highlights the importance of considering block effects in deepfake detection and provides a robust solution for open-world scenarios. The code for PLADA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or ``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects" introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the ``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust solution for open-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: object detection, YOLOv7, video-based detection, temporal information, real-time inference

Summary:
Our research focuses on improving object detection in videos by utilizing temporal context while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. We propose a strategy of feeding multiple consecutive frames into a YOLO-based detector but supervising only the output of a single target frame. This allows us to leverage temporal information without the need for complex temporal modules, enhancing detection robustness in challenging scenarios like motion blur and occlusions. We conducted extensive experiments on MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in narrowing the performance gap between lightweight and heavy detection networks. Additionally, we introduce the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, containing annotated fisheye video sequences, to support further research in multi-frame video object detection. Our approach offers a practical solution for handling transient challenges in real-world applications like surveillance and autonomous driving. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions, and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally, we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces an adversarial masked image modeling method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation using transformers. This method addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by constructing an auxiliary masked domain from original images and training the transformer to predict segmentation masks based on masked inputs. By leveraging labeled and pseudo-labeled data, the method increases supervision signal and reduces the domain gap between original and masked domains using adversarial training. The approach also extends to CNN networks and is validated on three public medical image datasets, outperforming existing methods significantly. The code for the method is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2506.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available. State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance. We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods significantly.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features. Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for dense video captioning.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Graph-based Partition-and-Summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning in two stages. In the partition stage, the event proposal is split into shorter segments for more detailed captioning. The summarization stage focuses on summarizing the descriptions of each segment into one sentence to describe the entire event. The framework utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze the relationships between semantic words for effective summarization. Two GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN and LSTM. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on ActivityNet Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing scene evolution and object changes in dense video captioning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization" stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization. We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Traditional geometric methods face challenges with lens distortions and environmental variability in omnidirectional imaging. The new method directly learns and infers object distances from raw omnidirectional inputs, without requiring precise lens calibration. The approach is evaluated on three 360{\deg} datasets, showing superior performance to geometry-based methods and other learning baselines in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability. In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions. We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation, making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs, or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

WorldRestorer is a data-driven video restoration model that eliminates floaters and artifacts, while ConsistView ensures spatiotemporal coherence across multiple perspectives. Experimental results show significant enhancements in rendering quality and global coherence, validated through CLIP-based metrics and user preference in a study. The proposed model enables a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience, with users showing a strong preference for WonderFree over existing methods.

arXiv:2506.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability, which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Summary:
Generative artificial intelligence advancements are producing increasingly realistic fake remote sensing imagery (RSI), raising concerns about the spread of misinformation. Existing forgery detection methods struggle to detect diverse forgeries in RSIs due to the complex nature of artifacts evolving with sophisticated generative models. This paper introduces SFNet, a novel forgery detection framework that leverages both spatial and frequency domain features to accurately identify fake images in remote sensing data. By utilizing two independent feature extractors and domain feature mapping and refinement modules, SFNet effectively aligns and fuses multi-domain features while suppressing redundant information. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate SFNet's superior accuracy and robust generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. The code for SFNet is publicly available for further research and development.

arXiv:2506.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect, potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet, designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called VIPScene for automating 3D scene synthesis. Traditional methods require manual effort and expert knowledge, hindering progress in fields like architectural design and virtual reality. VIPScene leverages video generation models to encode commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world, ensuring coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. The framework integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and perception models to analyze objects semantically and geometrically. A new evaluation metric, FPVScore, is introduced for coherence and plausibility assessment using first-person perspective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VIPScene over existing methods and its ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. The code for VIPScene will be made available for further research and applications. <div>

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

<div> Neural Radiance Fields, 3D reconstruction, Space Situational Awareness, non-cooperative space objects, camera poses

Summary:
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) were used for 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated mono-chromatic images. The challenging scenario included unknown object orientation, limited viewing angles, and absence of diffuse lighting. This study focused on jointly optimizing camera poses with NeRF to enhance 3D reconstruction accuracy. Training with successive images one-by-one yielded the most accurate results. Camera poses were estimated by optimizing uniform rotation and applying regularization to prevent large gaps between successive poses. The research highlights the importance of accurate 3D modeling for Space Situational Awareness, with potential applications in active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, and anomaly detection. The study underscores the effectiveness of NeRF models in overcoming challenges posed by unique camera characteristics and environmental conditions in reconstructing 3D models of space objects.

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Summary:
Microscopy image analysis is crucial for various applications but the increasing volume of images necessitates the development of deep learning-based methods. Deep neural networks have shown promise, but the interpretability of their results remains a challenge. This study introduces a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) approach to improve model interpretability in microscopy image classification. By utilizing benchmark datasets from different microscopic image realms, such as plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells, the researchers demonstrate that the DRL framework, which transfers knowledge from synthetic data, achieves a balanced performance between accuracy and interpretability. This approach enhances the understanding of how deep learning models make decisions in microscopy image analysis, which is essential for broader applications in this domain.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability, an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification. Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains (plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces MMSearch-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for large multimodal models to perform on-demand search in real-world Internet environments. The framework integrates image and text search tools and uses a reward-based mechanism to guide the model on when and how to invoke them. A multimodal search VQA dataset is collected to train the model, covering diverse knowledge needs and curating a search-balanced subset for efficient search behavior. Experimental results show that MMSearch-R1 outperforms RAG-based baselines, reduces search calls by over 30%, and matches the performance of larger models. The study provides insights for enhancing research in multimodal search. <div>
arXiv:2506.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors. We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over 30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for advancing research in multimodal search.

<div> Semantic Scene Completion, Panoptic Scene Completion, IPFormer, 3D vision, Instance Proposals<br />
<br />
Summary:
IPFormer is a new approach for vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion that uses context-adaptive instance proposals at both training and testing phases. It improves upon existing methods by dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context, which leads to better performance in panoptic metrics and a significant reduction in runtime. By refining these proposals through attention-based encoding and decoding, IPFormer can reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships and achieve higher accuracy in scene completion tasks. Experimental results show that IPFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panoptic metrics, with a notable increase in PQ-All and significant improvements in combined Thing-metrics. This innovative approach introduces a pioneering method for addressing the challenges of vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding. While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context, as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover (LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, autoregressive models, masked diffusion models, decoder-only framework, generation speedups<br />
Summary:<br />
- The research compares autoregressive (AR) and masked diffusion models (MDMs) by evaluating MDMs within a decoder-only framework, allowing for a fair comparison of the two paradigms. 
- It suggests refining the Any-Order AR objective, which currently averages over all token permutations, to better capture the language's left-to-right structure.
- The study investigates architectural influences in MDMs, finding that decoder-only MDMs can achieve significant generation speedups and comparable perplexity with temperature annealing compared to encoder-only models.
- By decoupling core paradigm differences from architectural influences, the research offers insights for future model design and highlights key trade-offs between decoder-only and encoder-only approaches.
- Code for the study is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR) approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space, decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

<title>VoxelOpt: Voxel-Adaptive Message Passing for Discrete Optimization in Deformable Abdominal CT Registration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations, we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/VoxelOpt

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless contribute to the same goal.

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world, knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or respond.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise, compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However, existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer, enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset, we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MS-IQA/MS-IQA/.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning (ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making, driving advances in their development and application for medical images. However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and reveal classification errors.

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations. While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data. Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage, anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on 1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability. Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard QR code readers.

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields, and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space (HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling. Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from 260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN) architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500 distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding, performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production, enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches, DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches, validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care. However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/13204942/RadiomicsImageFusion_FetalUS}{GitHub}.

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios. To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of 1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench. Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring the need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with improved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found in this Github repository: https://github.com/interaction-lab/HRIBench.

<title>Weighted Mean Frequencies: a handcraft Fourier feature for 4D Flow MRI segmentation</title>

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source while requiring no manual masks.

Abstract: DETR is a novel end-to-end transformer architecture object detector, which significantly outperforms classic detectors when scaling up. In this paper, we focus on the compression of DETR with knowledge distillation. While knowledge distillation has been well-studied in classic detectors, there is a lack of researches on how to make it work effectively on DETR. We first provide experimental and theoretical analysis to point out that the main challenge in DETR distillation is the lack of consistent distillation points. Distillation points refer to the corresponding inputs of the predictions for student to mimic, which have different formulations in CNN detector and DETR, and reliable distillation requires sufficient distillation points which are consistent between teacher and student.
  Based on this observation, we propose the first general knowledge distillation paradigm for DETR (KD-DETR) with consistent distillation points sampling, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation. Specifically, we decouple detection and distillation tasks by introducing a set of specialized object queries to construct distillation points for DETR. We further propose a general-to-specific distillation points sampling strategy to explore the extensibility of KD-DETR. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization of KD-DETR. For both single-scale DAB-DETR and multis-scale Deformable DETR and DINO, KD-DETR boost the performance of student model with improvements of $2.6\%-5.2\%$. We further extend KD-DETR to heterogeneous distillation, and achieves $2.1\%$ improvement by distilling the knowledge from DINO to Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50, which is comparable with homogeneous distillation methods.The code is available at https://github.com/wennyuhey/KD-DETR.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.

Abstract: Capturing voxel-wise spatial correspondence across distinct modalities is crucial for medical image analysis. However, current registration approaches are not practical enough in terms of registration accuracy and clinical applicability. In this paper, we introduce MambaMorph, a novel multi-modality deformable registration framework. Specifically, MambaMorph utilizes a Mamba-based registration module and a fine-grained, yet simple, feature extractor for efficient long-range correspondence modeling and high-dimensional feature learning, respectively. Additionally, we develop a well-annotated brain MR-CT registration dataset, SR-Reg, to address the scarcity of data in multi-modality registration. To validate MambaMorph's multi-modality registration capabilities, we conduct quantitative experiments on both our SR-Reg dataset and a public T1-T2 dataset. The experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MambaMorph significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art learning-based registration methods in terms of registration accuracy. Further study underscores the efficiency of the Mamba-based registration module and the lightweight feature extractor, which achieve notable registration quality while maintaining reasonable computational costs and speeds. We believe that MambaMorph holds significant potential for practical applications in medical image registration. The code for MambaMorph is available at: https://github.com/Guo-Stone/MambaMorph.

Abstract: Language promptable X-ray image segmentation would enable greater flexibility for human-in-the-loop workflows in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving problems within a narrow scope, but expanding to broader use requires additional data, annotations, and training time. Recently, language-aligned foundation models (LFMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable image and text data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing foundation models for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where large, richly annotated datasets are available. However, the X-ray imaging modality features highly variable image appearance and applications, from diagnostic chest X-rays to interventional fluoroscopy, with varying availability of data. To pave the way toward an LFM for comprehensive and language-aligned analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we introduce FluoroSAM, a language-promptable variant of the Segment Anything Model, trained from scratch on 3M synthetic X-ray images from a wide variety of human anatomies, imaging geometries, and viewing angles. These include pseudo-ground truth masks for 128 organ types and 464 tools with associated text descriptions. FluoroSAM is capable of segmenting myriad anatomical structures and tools based on natural language prompts, thanks to the novel incorporation of vector quantization (VQ) of text embeddings in the training process. We demonstrate FluoroSAM's performance quantitatively on real X-ray images and showcase on several applications how FluoroSAM is a key enabler for rich human-machine interaction in the X-ray image acquisition and analysis context.

Abstract: Neural field-based SLAM methods typically employ a single, monolithic field as their scene representation. This prevents efficient incorporation of loop closure constraints and limits scalability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel RGB-D neural mapping framework in which the scene is represented by a collection of lightweight neural fields which are dynamically anchored to the pose graph of a sparse visual SLAM system. Our approach shows the ability to integrate large-scale loop closures, while requiring only minimal reintegration. Furthermore, we verify the scalability of our approach by demonstrating successful building-scale mapping taking multiple loop closures into account during the optimization, and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on large scenes in terms of quality and runtime. Our code is available open-source at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/neural_graph_mapping.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) building upon the foundation of powerful large language models have made rapid progress in reasoning across visual and textual data. While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles.
  GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed error analysis reveals challenges at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language understanding, and pattern generalization.

Abstract: Toddlers learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no supervision. During this learning, they execute frequent eye and head movements that shape their visual experience. It is presently unclear if and how these behaviors contribute to toddlers' emerging object recognition abilities. To answer this question, we here combine head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play with unsupervised machine learning. We approximate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions from a head-mounted camera centered on the current gaze location estimated via eye tracking. This visual stream feeds an unsupervised computational model of toddlers' learning, which constructs visual representations that slowly change over time. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also shows that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior may support their development of view-invariant object recognition.

Abstract: Spike cameras, as an innovative neuromorphic camera that captures scenes with the 0-1 bit stream at 40 kHz, are increasingly employed for the 3D reconstruction task via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a casecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike streams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then progressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this cascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality limitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation, ultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \textbf{USP-Gaussian}, that unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian splatting into an end-to-end framework. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera, our framework enables a joint iterative optimization that seamlessly integrates information between the spike-to-image network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets with accurate poses demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors. Moreover, we integrate pose optimization to achieve robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios with inaccurate initial poses, outperforming alternative methods by effectively reducing noise and preserving fine texture details. Our code, data and trained models will be available at https://github.com/chenkang455/USP-Gaussian.

Abstract: While Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates efficient and high-quality scene rendering and small area surface extraction ability, it falls short in handling large-scale aerial image surface extraction tasks. To overcome this, we present ULSR-GS, a framework dedicated to high-fidelity surface extraction in ultra-large-scale scenes, addressing the limitations of existing GS-based mesh extraction methods. Specifically, we propose a point-to-photo partitioning approach combined with a multi-view optimal view matching principle to select the best training images for each sub-region. Additionally, during training, ULSR-GS employs a densification strategy based on multi-view geometric consistency to enhance surface extraction details. Experimental results demonstrate that ULSR-GS outperforms other state-of-the-art GS-based works on large-scale aerial photogrammetry benchmark datasets, significantly improving surface extraction accuracy in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Learning lighting adaptation is a crucial step in achieving good visual perception and supporting downstream vision tasks. Current research often addresses individual light-related challenges, such as high dynamic range imaging and exposure correction, in isolation. However, we identify shared fundamental properties across these tasks: i) different color channels have different light properties, and ii) the channel differences reflected in the spatial and frequency domains are different. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the channel-aware Learning Adaptive Lighting Network (LALNet), a multi-task framework designed to handle multiple light-related tasks efficiently. Specifically, LALNet incorporates color-separated features that highlight the unique light properties of each color channel, integrated with traditional color-mixed features by Light Guided Attention (LGA). The LGA utilizes color-separated features to guide color-mixed features focusing on channel differences and ensuring visual consistency across all channels. Additionally, LALNet employs dual domain channel modulation for generating color-separated features and a mixed channel modulation and light state space module for producing color-mixed features. Extensive experiments on four representative light-related tasks demonstrate that LALNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tests and requires fewer computational resources. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxx2025.github.io/LALNet/.

<title>World-Consistent Data Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires an agent to navigate through photorealistic environments following natural-language instructions. One main obstacle existing in VLN is data scarcity, leading to poor generalization performance over unseen environments. Though data argumentation is a promising way for scaling up the dataset, how to generate VLN data both diverse and world-consistent remains problematic. To cope with this issue, we propose the world-consistent data generation (WCGEN), an efficacious data-augmentation framework satisfying both diversity and world-consistency, aimed at enhancing the generalization of agents to novel environments. Roughly, our framework consists of two stages, the trajectory stage which leverages a point-cloud based technique to ensure spatial coherency among viewpoints, and the viewpoint stage which adopts a novel angle synthesis method to guarantee spatial and wraparound consistency within the entire observation. By accurately predicting viewpoint changes with 3D knowledge, our approach maintains the world-consistency during the generation procedure. Experiments on a wide range of datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that our data augmentation strategy enables agents to achieve new state-of-the-art results on all navigation tasks, and is capable of enhancing the VLN agents' generalization ability to unseen environments.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for depth estimation using images obtained from monocular structured light systems. In contrast to many existing methods that depend on image matching, our technique employs a density voxel grid to represent scene geometry. This grid is trained through self-supervised differentiable volume rendering. Our method leverages color fields derived from the projected patterns in structured light systems during the rendering process, facilitating the isolated optimization of the geometry field. This innovative approach leads to faster convergence and high-quality results. Additionally, we integrate normalized device coordinates (NDC), a distortion loss, and a distinctive surface-based color loss to enhance geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current matching-based techniques in terms of geometric performance in few-shot scenarios, achieving an approximately 30% reduction in average estimated depth errors for both synthetic scenes and real-world captured scenes. Moreover, our approach allows for rapid training, being approximately three times faster than previous matching-free methods that utilize implicit representations.

Abstract: De-identification of medical images is a critical step to ensure privacy during data sharing in research and clinical settings. The initial step in this process involves detecting Protected Health Information (PHI), which can be found in image metadata or imprinted within image pixels. Despite the importance of such systems, there has been limited evaluation of existing AI-based solutions, creating barriers to the development of reliable and robust tools. In this study, we present an AI-based pipeline for PHI detection, comprising three key modules: text detection, text extraction, and text analysis. We benchmark three models - YOLOv11, EasyOCR, and GPT-4o - across different setups corresponding to these modules, evaluating their performance on two different datasets encompassing multiple imaging modalities and PHI categories. Our findings indicate that the optimal setup involves utilizing dedicated vision and language models for each module, which achieves a commendable balance in performance, latency, and cost associated with the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we show that the application of LLMs not only involves identifying PHI content but also enhances OCR tasks and facilitates an end-to-end PHI detection pipeline, showcasing promising outcomes through our analysis.

<title>VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.

<title>MatSwap: Light-aware material transfers in images</title>

Abstract: We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically. Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We release our code and data on https://github.com/astra-vision/MatSwap

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently enabled the creation of visually compelling, detailed images from textual prompts. However, their ability to accurately represent various cultural nuances remains an open question. In our work, we introduce CultDiff benchmark, evaluating state-of-the-art diffusion models whether they can generate culturally specific images spanning ten countries. We show that these models often fail to generate cultural artifacts in architecture, clothing, and food, especially for underrepresented country regions, by conducting a fine-grained analysis of different similarity aspects, revealing significant disparities in cultural relevance, description fidelity, and realism compared to real-world reference images. With the collected human evaluations, we develop a neural-based image-image similarity metric, namely, CultDiff-S, to predict human judgment on real and generated images with cultural artifacts. Our work highlights the need for more inclusive generative AI systems and equitable dataset representation over a wide range of cultures.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image restoration tasks such as super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a 'confidence mask' capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.

Abstract: 3D gaussian splatting has advanced simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology by enabling real-time positioning and the construction of high-fidelity maps. However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate an average frame rate of 36 FPS on Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets, achieving competitive accuracy in both localization and mapping.

<title>Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation</title>

Abstract: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum vision transformers (QViTs), vision transformers (ViTs) with self-attention (SA) mechanisms replaced by quantum self-attention (QSA) mechanisms, can match state-of-the-art (SOTA) biomedical image classifiers while using 99.99% fewer parameters. QSAs are produced by replacing linear SA layers with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), producing a QSA mechanism and reducing parameter scaling from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. On RetinaMNIST, our ultra parameter-efficient QViT outperforms 13/14 SOTA methods including CNNs and ViTs, achieving 56.5% accuracy, just 0.88% below the top MedMamba model while using 99.99% fewer parameters (1K vs 14.5M) and 89% fewer GFLOPs. We present the first investigation of knowledge distillation (KD) from classical to quantum vision transformers in biomedical image classification, showing that QViTs maintain comparable performance to classical ViTs across eight diverse datasets spanning multiple modalities, with improved QSA parameter-efficiency. Our higher-qubit architecture benefitted more from KD pre-training, suggesting a scaling relationship between QSA parameters and KD effectiveness. These findings establish QSA as a practical architectural choice toward parameter-efficient biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.

<title>A Siamese Network to Detect If Two Iris Images Are Monozygotic</title>

Abstract: This study presents the first automated classifier designed to determine whether a pair of iris images originates from monozygotic individuals, addressing a previously untackled problem in biometric recognition. In Daugman-style iris recognition, the textures of the left and right irises of the same person are traditionally considered as being as different as the irises of two unrelated persons. However, previous research indicates that humans can detect that two iris images are from different eyes of the same person, or eyes of monozygotic twins, with an accuracy of about 80%. In this work, we employ a Siamese network architecture and contrastive learning to categorize a pair of iris images as coming from monozygotic or non-monozygotic irises. This could potentially be applied, for example, as a fast, noninvasive test to determine if twins are monozygotic or non-monozygotic. We construct a dataset comprising both synthetic monozygotic pairs (images of different irises of the same individual) and natural monozygotic pairs (images of different images from persons who are identical twins), in addition to non-monozygotic pairs from unrelated individuals, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the learned representations, we train and analyze three variants of the model using (1) the original input images, (2) iris-only images (masking everything but the iris region), and (3) non-iris-only images (masking the iris region). This comparison reveals that both iris texture and surrounding ocular structure contain information useful for the model to classify the image pairs as monozygotic or non-monozygotic. Our approach achieves accuracy levels using the full iris image that exceed those previously reported for human classification of monozygotic iris pairs.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS

Abstract: Shapes and textures are the basic building blocks of visual perception. The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures and materials independently of their associated objects, is essential for a general visual understanding of the world. This work introduces the Large Shape and Textures dataset (LAS&amp;T), a giant collection of highly diverse shapes and textures, created by unsupervised extraction of patterns from natural images. This dataset is used to benchmark how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) understand shapes, textures, and materials in 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test the models' ability to match images of identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that the shape recognition capabilities of the LVLMs remain significantly below human performance. LVLMs rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking clear class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluated the models' ability to identify images with identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler more abstract 2D textures. These results are consistent across a wide range of leading VLMs (GPT/Gemini/LLama/Qwen) and foundation vision models (DINO/CLIP), exposing major deficiencies in the ability of leading models to understand fundamental visual concepts. In contrast, simple nets trained directly for these tasks achieve high accuracy. The LAS&amp;T dataset, featuring over 600,000 images for 2D/3D shape, texture, and material recognition and retrieval, is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of skin color measurement methods from dermatoscopic images using a synthetic dataset (S-SYNTH) with controlled ground-truth melanin content, lesion shapes, hair models, and 18 distinct lighting conditions. This allows for rigorous assessment of the robustness and invariance to lighting conditions. We assess four classes of image colorimetry approaches: segmentation-based, patch-based, color quantization, and neural networks. We use these methods to estimate the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) and Fitzpatrick types from dermatoscopic images. Our results show that segmentation-based and color quantization methods yield robust, lighting-invariant estimates, whereas patch-based approaches exhibit significant lighting-dependent biases that require calibration. Furthermore, neural network models, particularly when combined with heavy blurring to reduce overfitting, can provide light-invariant Fitzpatrick predictions, although their generalization to real-world images remains unverified. We conclude with practical recommendations for designing fair and reliable skin color estimation methods.

Abstract: Cameras rely on auto white balance (AWB) to correct undesirable color casts caused by scene illumination and the camera's spectral sensitivity. This is typically achieved using an illuminant estimator that determines the global color cast solely from the color information in the camera's raw sensor image. Mobile devices provide valuable additional metadata-such as capture timestamp and geolocation-that offers strong contextual clues to help narrow down the possible illumination solutions. This paper proposes a lightweight illuminant estimation method that incorporates such contextual metadata, along with additional capture information and image colors, into a compact model (~5K parameters), achieving promising results, matching or surpassing larger models. To validate our method, we introduce a dataset of 3,224 smartphone images with contextual metadata collected at various times of day and under diverse lighting conditions. The dataset includes ground-truth illuminant colors, determined using a color chart, and user-preferred illuminants validated through a user study, providing a comprehensive benchmark for AWB evaluation.

Abstract: Chronic wounds affect a large population, particularly the elderly and diabetic patients, who often exhibit limited mobility and co-existing health conditions. Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For a fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validation to minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the five best architectures based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, is integrated into a custom telehealth system.

Abstract: Sports analysis requires processing large amounts of data, which is time-consuming and costly. Advancements in neural networks have significantly alleviated this burden, enabling highly accurate ball tracking in sports broadcasts. However, relying solely on 2D ball tracking is limiting, as it depends on the camera's viewpoint and falls short of supporting comprehensive game analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing precise 3D ball trajectories from online table tennis match recordings. Our method leverages the underlying physics of the ball's motion to identify the bounce state that minimizes the reprojection error of the ball's flying trajectory, hence ensuring an accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to infer ball spin without relying on human pose estimation or racket tracking, which are often unreliable or unavailable in broadcast footage. We developed an automated camera calibration method capable of reliably tracking camera movements. Additionally, we adapted an existing 3D pose estimation model, which lacks depth motion capture, to accurately track player movements. Together, these contributions enable the full 3D reconstruction of a table tennis rally.

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness. Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.

<title>VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants, with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green) among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.

Abstract: Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos. Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes will be available soon.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation enables immersive 360{\deg} content creation, valuable in applications that demand scene-consistent world exploration. However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

Abstract: Story visualization, which aims to generate a sequence of visually coherent images aligning with a given narrative and reference images, has seen significant progress with recent advancements in generative models. To further enhance the performance of story visualization frameworks in real-world scenarios, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ViStoryBench. We collect a diverse dataset encompassing various story types and artistic styles, ensuring models are evaluated across multiple dimensions such as different plots (e.g., comedy, horror) and visual aesthetics (e.g., anime, 3D renderings). ViStoryBench is carefully curated to balance narrative structures and visual elements, featuring stories with single and multiple protagonists to test models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it includes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in generating accurate visuals. To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark incorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects. This structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering targeted improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper, we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100 high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I benchmarks.

Abstract: We estimate scene depth from a single defocus-blurred image using the dark channel as a complementary cue, leveraging its ability to capture local statistics and scene structure. Traditional depth-from-defocus (DFD) methods use multiple images with varying apertures or focus. Single-image DFD is underexplored due to its inherent challenges. Few attempts have focused on depth-from-defocus (DFD) from a single defocused image because the problem is underconstrained. Our method uses the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast variations as depth cues to improve scene structure estimation. The pipeline is trained end-to-end with adversarial learning. Experiments on real data demonstrate that incorporating the dark channel prior into single-image DFD provides meaningful depth estimation, validating our approach.

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning module dedicated to refining boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a Dynamic Complementary Competition module that leverages two high-performing sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our approach achieves a notable improvement of at least 6%, highlighting the significant advancements. The code is available at https://github.com/Y-TARL/C3S3.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance. Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Molecular assays are standard of care for detecting genomic alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy selection but are costly, tissue-destructive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely employed in the field of 3D manipulation due to their efficient capability to learn distributions, allowing for precise prediction of action trajectories. However, diffusion models typically rely on large parameter UNet backbones as policy networks, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising solution for efficient modeling, offering low computational complexity and strong performance in sequence modeling. In this work, we propose the Mamba Policy, a lighter but stronger policy that reduces the parameter count by over 80% compared to the original policy network while achieving superior performance. Specifically, we introduce the XMamba Block, which effectively integrates input information with conditional features and leverages a combination of Mamba and Attention mechanisms for deep feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy's enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework. Real-world experiments are also conducted to further validate its effectiveness. Our open-source project page can be found at https://andycao1125.github.io/mamba_policy/.

Abstract: Web development involves turning UI designs into functional webpages, which can be difficult for both beginners and experienced developers due to the complexity of HTML's hierarchical structures and styles. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed in a cloud often allow users to query models via the APIs. However, these APIs expose the models to model extraction attacks (MEAs). In this attack, the attacker attempts to duplicate the target model by abusing the responses from the API. Backdoor-based DNN watermarking is known as a promising defense against MEAs, wherein the defender injects a backdoor into extracted models via API responses. The backdoor is used as a watermark of the model; if a suspicious model has the watermark (i.e., backdoor), it is verified as an extracted model. This work focuses on object detection (OD) models. Existing backdoor attacks on OD models are not applicable for model watermarking as the defense against MEAs on a realistic threat model. Our proposed approach involves inserting a backdoor into extracted models via APIs by stealthily modifying the bounding-boxes (BBs) of objects detected in queries while keeping the OD capability. In our experiments on three OD datasets, the proposed approach succeeded in identifying the extracted models with 100% accuracy in a wide variety of experimental scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate predictions and representations of plant growth patterns in simulated and controlled environments are important for addressing various challenges in plant phenomics research. This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them across multiple datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately captures SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interactions. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers, which can be costly and time-consuming. MAMMA uses a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks based on segmentation masks, allowing for person-specific correspondence estimation even under heavy occlusion. The system employs a novel architecture using learnable queries for each landmark, enabling accurate capture of complex interactions. A large synthetic dataset with diverse human motions is used to train the network, generating high-variability sequences with rich body contact and occlusion. MAMMA offers competitive reconstruction quality to commercial marker-based solutions without requiring extensive manual cleanup. Additionally, the article addresses the lack of benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and markerless motion capture by introducing evaluation settings using real multi-view sequences. The dataset, benchmark, method, training code, and pre-trained model weights will be released for research purposes. <div>

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers. Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware, manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods. To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method, training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction. However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

<div> Keywords: YOLOv8, vehicle detection, license plate recognition, carbon emissions, deep learning<br />
Summary: <br />
This article presents an enhanced YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection and classification to estimate carbon emissions in urban areas. The framework includes a dedicated deep learning-based identification module for recognizing license plates and classifying vehicle types. A hybrid pipeline is used to track vehicles, crop bounding boxes, and pass them to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module for license plate decoding. The OCR system, trained for character-level detection, achieves high accuracy even under challenging conditions. The recognized plate information is validated using an external vehicle registration database for accurate classification and emission estimation. Evaluation on a diverse dataset shows promising results, with the YOLOv8 detector achieving high precision for bounding boxes and segmentation masks, and the OCR system reaching up to 99% accuracy. This multi-stage approach offers a practical solution for automated, vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring in smart transportation systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system, composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles. Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8 detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

<div> Keywords: Parkinson disease, finger-tapping test, computer vision, motor characteristics, machine learning

Summary: 
This study introduces a computer vision-based method for quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson's disease patients during the finger-tapping test. The approach aims to provide a more objective and granular assessment compared to traditional subjective evaluations. Four sets of features are proposed to characterize specific motor deficits such as hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. Machine learning classifiers trained on these features demonstrate higher accuracy in predicting the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. The video-based analysis also allows for further distinctions within the identified deficits. The framework offers a practical solution for objectively assessing PD motor characteristics that can be potentially applied in clinical and remote settings, with the need for future validation in response to treatment and disease progression.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

<div> Keywords: minimal paths, tubular structures, reinforcement learning, Markov Decision Process, Q-Learning

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for tracking tubular structures by casting the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and using reinforcement learning, specifically Q-Learning. This approach dynamically explores a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space, thus avoiding the high cost of pre-computed graphs. The method outperforms existing point-wise and segment-wise approaches, handling complex topologies and maintaining global path coherence without extensive prior knowledge. Experimental results on tubular structure datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in tracking tubular structures. The framework effectively addresses challenges posed by complex morphologies and environmental variations, making it a promising solution for applications in tracking blood vessels and roads.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances. Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted.

Summary: <br />
Training efficient urban spatio-temporal models that generalize well across diverse regions is crucial. Existing Transformer-based models suffer from scalability issues. This study introduces Damba-ST, a domain-adaptive Mamba-based model that combines efficiency with adaptability. It partitions the latent space into shared and domain-specific subspaces to capture commonalities and unique features. Domain adapters bridge disparate domain distributions for alignment. Damba-ST outperforms existing models, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization for seamless deployment in new urban environments. <div>
arXiv:2506.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, spectral dictionary token mixer, performance metrics, efficiency, interpretability

Summary: 
The article introduces SDict-VLM, a vision-language model that eliminates convolutions and self-attention by utilizing a spectral dictionary token mixer. This approach represents image patches or wordpieces as a sparse combination of learnable frequency atoms, achieving impressive results on MS-COCO captioning and VQAv2 tasks. SDict-VLM closes a significant portion of the performance gap to existing models while using fewer parameters, less memory, and faster inference. It is the first VLM to match mid-scale transformer baselines without convolutions or self-attention. The shared frequency dictionary allows for transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable trade-off between accuracy and compute efficiency. Overall, SDict-VLM paves the way for efficient and interpretable vision-language models with O(L log L) complexity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype, SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60 percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and interpretable VLMs.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

Summary: 
GLIMPSE is a new framework for interpreting the visual attention of large vision language models (LVLMs) during open-ended visual question answering. It combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to generate attribution heat maps for understanding cross-modal reasoning. The framework outperforms previous methods in human-alignment and allows for analyzing LVLM behavior, including token-level reasoning dynamics and systematic human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs. However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

<div> Keywords: diffusion transformer, mamba model, distillation, text-to-image generation, high-resolution image generation

Summary:
Diffusion transformers (DiT) have quadratic computational complexity, making high-resolution image generation expensive. The Mamba model, with linear complexity, is a promising alternative but is challenging to train directly. This paper proposes diffusion transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD) to efficiently train the Mamba model. By combining diffusion self-attention and Mamba, T2MD achieves efficiency and global dependencies. Using layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD eases the training difficulty and cost of the state-space model. Starting from a distilled 512x512 base model, the generation is scaled to 2048x2048 images with lightweight adaptation and high-resolution fine-tuning. Results show that the proposed training approach produces high-quality text-to-image generation with low overhead. Additionally, the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for non-causal visual output is demonstrated, suggesting potential for future research.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards 2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future exploration.

Summary:   
Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge (OoPk) is proposed for Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA), addressing challenges in catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. The method projects a tuning subspace orthogonally to preserve source model knowledge while adapting to new domains. An online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy uses image masking to enhance domain adaptability and improve pseudo label quality.

arXiv:2506.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge, dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic segmentation tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces HAWAII, a framework designed to enhance the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs) by distilling knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder. HAWAII minimizes computational costs during training by using teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters and a router to manage conflicts and switch between teacher-specific knowledge.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs) is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Summary: 
Foundation Models are changing Affective Computing, with Vision Language Models able to identify emotions in zero shot scenarios. This study investigates the visual cues these models use to determine affect and whether they are based on psychological principles or superficially learned. Results show varying performance based on the visibility of teeth, with eyebrow position being a key driver of affective reasoning in the best-performing model, GPT-4o. The model demonstrates a high level of internal consistency in its predictions. These findings highlight the evolving behaviors of Foundation Models but also raise concerns about shortcut learning, bias, and fairness issues, particularly in sensitive areas like mental health and education. <div>

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC), with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge. Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size, sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily, context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process. However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality. High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ControlGenAI/Inverse-and-Edit.

<div> Keywords: 3D semantic scene generation, primitives, latent diffusion, structured latent representation, object manipulation

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces PrITTI, a framework for large-scale 3D semantic scene generation using primitives as foundational elements. PrITTI leverages a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in rasterized format and objects as vectorized 3D primitives. The structured latent representation allows for flexible manipulation of scene components. A stable Cholesky-based parameterization is introduced to encode object size and orientation efficiently. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that PrITTI outperforms voxel-based methods in generation quality while reducing memory requirements by up to 3 times. PrITTI enables direct manipulation of objects within the scene and supports various downstream applications such as scene inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). By leveraging both RGB and thermal infrared data, the new tracker utilizes a progressive fusion framework that learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions using separable attention. This design helps in generating effective feature representations for accurate target localization.

Furthermore, with parameter counts of less than 4 million, it offers the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This work is significant as it is the first to utilize Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking, showing promising results in terms of efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Summary: 
PRISM is introduced as a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework for keyframe extraction. Using perceptual color difference metrics in the CIELAB color space, PRISM identifies standout moments in video content efficiently. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is interpretable and does not require training, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained settings. The evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates PRISM's strong accuracy, fidelity, and high compression ratios in both structured and unstructured video content. This framework's effectiveness makes it a valuable tool for content moderation, summarization, and forensic analysis, particularly in addressing harmful and politically sensitive media in online platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online platforms.

<div> Keywords: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, opportunistic screening, multimodal data, CXR, ECG

Summary:
The study highlights Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) as the leading cause of mortality globally and emphasizes the potential of opportunistic screening using multimodal data such as CXR and ECG. The proposed predictive modeling framework, MOSCARD, integrates and aligns CXR and ECG data while incorporating causal reasoning and de-confounding techniques. This approach outperformed single modality models and existing foundational models in predicting MACE risk. By leveraging CXR insights into chronic conditions and ECG assessment of cardiac activity, MOSCARD aims to improve risk assessment accuracy, enable early intervention, and reduce disparities in patient outcomes. The cost-effective opportunistic screening approach presented in this study has the potential to enhance patient care and preventive strategies for MACE. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021. Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities. Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT) measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework - MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC: 0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets, OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species. Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits, establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity assessments.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization, embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities. With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges, including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies. We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation, and decipherment of ancient scripts.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels: classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs, revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and improve accuracy in clinical practice.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets, eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset, thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of 5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach in remote sensing change detection using a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) to capture long-range dependencies between image channels effectively. The 3D-SSM incorporates a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) for bi-temporal feature integration and a multi-branch feature extraction module (MBFEM) to provide a rich representation of contextual information within the image. This method outperforms existing approaches on five benchmark datasets by enhancing the detection of subtle changes through global information capturing and feature integration. The proposed 3D-SSM model effectively combines features from the frequency domain, spatial domain, and the 3D-SSM module to improve feature representation capabilities and overall performance in change detection tasks.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain, spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five benchmark datasets through extensive experiments.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new unsupervised domain adaptation method called Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN). CAN utilizes collaborative and adversarial learning to train neural networks for domain-specific and domain-invariant feature representation. By incorporating domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights, CAN effectively tackles domain distribution mismatch. The proposed training scheme automatically learns domain-specific features from lower blocks and domain-invariant features from higher blocks in convolutional neural networks. Additionally, Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN) is introduced to enhance discriminability in the target domain by selecting pseudo-labeled target samples in an easy-to-hard progression. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAN and SPCAN achieve state-of-the-art performance in object recognition and video action recognition tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain, while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme, which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of "uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception: complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules, and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban, suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions. The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The dataset and development kits are open-sourced at https://github.com/taco-group/AirV2X-Perception.

<div> Keywords: waterway perception, image captioning, vision-language models, USVs, Da Yu

Summary: 
Automated waterway perception is essential for unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to navigate effectively. Current perception models focus on instance-level object perception but struggle with understanding the global semantic information of waterways. To address this, a new dataset called WaterCaption is introduced, focusing on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions for waterway environments. Additionally, a novel edge-deployable multi-modal large language model called Da Yu is proposed for USVs, incorporating a vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) for efficient visual feature modeling. Da Yu outperforms existing models on the WaterCaption dataset and other captioning benchmarks, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency in generating textual descriptions for waterway environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.

<div> Gaussian splatting, deformable framework, embodied view synthesis, invertible neural flow, reconstruction quality <br />
<br />Summary:
The proposed HoliGS framework introduces a novel approach to deformable Gaussian splatting for embodied view synthesis (EVS) from long monocular RGB videos. By utilizing invertible Gaussian Splatting deformation networks, the method effectively reconstructs dynamic environments with static backgrounds and time-varying objects. Gaussian primitives are learned to undergo global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint rendering from different embodied camera trajectories, attaching Gaussians to a complete canonical foreground shape. HoliGS achieves superior reconstruction quality on challenging datasets while reducing both training and rendering time compared to existing monocular deformable NeRF methods. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world scenarios. The source code for the method will be made available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors. Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world scenarios. The source code will be released.

<div> Keywords: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation, Vision Language Models, Segment Anything Model, domain gap, localization accuracy

Summary:
In this paper, a novel approach called Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) is proposed to tackle the challenges of segmenting and classifying camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories. The method utilizes a VLM-guided cascaded framework, with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) being guided by the VLM to improve segmentation accuracy. The framework leverages VLM-derived features as prompts for SAM, leading to better attention and localization of camouflaged regions. To address the domain gap, the segmentation output is treated as a soft spatial prior for more accurate classification. By sharing the same VLM for both segmentation and classification tasks, efficiency and semantic consistency are ensured. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both OVCOS and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However, these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs' full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification, we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance, leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged objects.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos, while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills, particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness, highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point clouds and proposes LM-AD, a novel method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches. By introducing the Affordance Query Module (AQM), the method efficiently captures fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by utilizing a pretrained language model. The reliance on simple cosine similarity between point cloud and text embeddings is identified as a key limitation in current methods, prompting the development of a more expressive solution. Through experiments on the 3D AffordanceNet dataset, LM-AD demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union compared to existing approaches. This highlights the potential of leveraging language models for enhancing affordance detection in 3D point clouds. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks.

To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained language model.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) for multi-modality domain adaptation. PMC aims to transfer knowledge between domains by utilizing multiple modalities such as RGB and depth information. Two modules within PMC are designed to select reliable pseudo-labeled target samples based on modality-specific and modality-integrated information. Additionally, a variant called PMC with privileged information (PMC-PI) is proposed for scenarios where certain modalities are missing in the target domain. A Multi-modality Data Generation (MMG) network is introduced to generate missing modalities in the target domain using adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Experimental results on image and video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PMC for various cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both multi-modality domain adaptation settings. <div>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting, some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC framework.

<div> Keywords: fundus image analysis, vision-language pre-training, multi-modal integration, catastrophic forgetting, rehearsal strategy

Summary:
Retinal foundation models traditionally focus on single-modal tasks in fundus image analysis, limiting their versatility. A new framework, RetCoP, addresses this limitation by integrating image and text features from various fundus imaging modalities into a unified model. To handle incremental data arrival in dynamic environments, RetCoP introduces a continual pre-training approach. Two key strategies are employed to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual learning: a rehearsal strategy utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information distillation method. These strategies enable the model to revisit previous knowledge and maintain alignment between image and text representations. Experimental results demonstrate that RetCoP outperforms existing methods, showcasing improved generalization and a lower forgetting rate. The code for RetCoP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks, ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility. Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Summary:
Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis plays a crucial role in predicting cancer survival, but current approaches often overlook the use of Fresh Frozen (FF) slides in addition to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides. This paper presents a new framework that utilizes hypergraph learning to effectively combine information from multiple Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and address modality imbalance issues between pathology slides and genomics data. A memory mechanism is introduced to handle incomplete modalities by storing previously learned features and adapting dynamically. Experimental results on TCGA datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods by 2.3% in C-Index. Additionally, in scenarios with incomplete modalities, the approach outperforms pathology-only models by 3.3% and gene-only models by 7.9%. The framework provides a promising direction for improving cancer survival prediction by leveraging diverse data modalities and enhancing cross-modality interactions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides. Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities, limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance. In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models (7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Summary: 
This paper introduces the Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation, derived from the Mumford-Shah variational framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods. This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex segmentation tasks and highlights its potential for use in real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

<div> recovery, stereo endoscopic images, tissue deformation, tool-tissue interaction analysis, surgical navigation <br />
Summary:
The article presents a new method for tissue deformation recovery using stereo endoscopic images, crucial for surgical navigation and tool-tissue interaction analysis. Unlike previous approaches, the method models tissue geometry and deformation using derivative and displacement maps, respectively. It utilizes 6 parameters for rigid motion and 3 for local deformation of each surface point, without the need for estimating camera pose. The method optimizes inter-frame deformation to align frames and introduces the concept of a canonical map for online optimization of tissue geometry and deformation. Experimental results using in vivo and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets demonstrate the method's ability to accurately model tissue geometry and deformation, even in occluded or out-of-view areas. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during different tissue manipulations, providing an additional modality for mechanical-based analysis. <div>

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing. Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6 parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera. Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation, making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow, the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches 0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance, respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Summary:
The study explores the development of the ability to recognize textual content in images during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It is found that text readability in images emerges abruptly after significant training iterations, in contrast to the gradual development of semantic understanding which begins early in the training process. This delayed emergence suggests that contrastive learning initially prioritizes general semantic understanding over text-specific symbolic processing. Furthermore, the ability to match images with rendered text evolves even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. The research emphasizes the importance of tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs and sets the foundation for further investigations into optimizing multimodal learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing multimodal learning.

<div> Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling, AI models, climate data, computational efficiency, climate projections 
Summary: 
Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) is introduced as an AI downscaling model that utilizes a hierarchical sampling process within the diffusion framework, significantly reducing computational load while maintaining competitive accuracy on climate datasets. HDD achieves this by implementing a coarse-to-fine hierarchy through a simple downsampling scheme. The model shows competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models, running on up to half as many pixels compared to traditional methods. Additionally, HDD offers a lightweight alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, allowing for affordable large-ensemble high-resolution climate projections. A single model trained at 0.25° resolution can seamlessly transfer across multiple CMIP6 models with coarser resolution. The code implementation for HDD is available at: https://github.com/HDD-Hierarchical-Diffusion-Downscaling/HDD-Hierarchical-Diffusion-Downscaling. <div>

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at 0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble high-resolution climate projections.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset.

Summary: Mem4Nav is a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system designed to enhance Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in urban environments. It incorporates a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing and a semantic topology graph for landmark connectivity. The system uses trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer to store information at both long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) levels. LTM retains historical observations, while STM caches recent multimodal entries for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq datasets with various backbones, Mem4Nav consistently improves Task Completion rates, reduces spatial perceptual discrepancy (SPD), and enhances normalized Dynamic Time Warping (nDTW) scores. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the hierarchical map and dual memory modules.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

AMF-MedIT is introduced as an efficient framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing challenges such as feature dimension discrepancies and modality contributions. The Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module is proposed to harmonize dimension discrepancies and adjust modality contributions dynamically, incorporating prior knowledge through modulation objectives and a modality confidence ratio. Feature masks, density, and leakage losses are utilized to achieve modulation objectives. FT-Mamba, a tabular encoder, is introduced to handle noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Interpretability studies reveal how different tabular encoders guide the imaging modality during contrastive pretraining. AMF-MedIT demonstrates superior multimodal performance and data efficiency, adapting well to incomplete tabular data.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

<div> Keywords: Image attribution analysis, Gradient integration, Trustworthy explanations, Sampling approach, ImageNet dataset 

Summary: 
Image attribution analysis aims to highlight feature representations learned by visual models to reflect the pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a key component in this analysis, but the alignment of sample distribution with natural image distribution is crucial for explanation certainty. Prior methods adding noise to images can decrease certainty, while additional information may oversaturate neural networks. To address this, a semi-optimal sampling approach is proposed, suppressing features to approximate the natural image distribution. Extensive evaluation on ImageNet dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, providing more satisfactory explanations compared to existing baselines across all experimental models. Trustworthy attribution analysis hinges on aligning sample distribution with natural image distribution, and the proposed sampling approach offers a promising solution to enhance the certainty and quality of explanations in image recognition tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a building block often combines with other information from visual models such as activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout all experimental models.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference.

We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and generalizable deblurring models.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks, the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns, limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look (saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering 158 categories of underwater objects.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation: (1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street" priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits, leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

<title>Visual hallucination detection in large vision-language models via evidential conflict</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19513</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

<title>ReMAR-DS: Recalibrated Feature Learning for Metal Artifact Reduction and CT Domain Transformation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19531</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT). The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions. Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks, causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR) systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1) detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network, where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat) with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56% accuracy.

<title>General Methods Make Great Domain-specific Foundation Models: A Case-study on Fetal Ultrasound</title>

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2 method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

<title>MambaOutRS: A Hybrid CNN-Fourier Architecture for Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability. However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant (24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and 95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification. These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus, MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

arXiv:2506.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR, effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: By the year 2023, the global population of individuals with impaired vision has surpassed 220 million. People with impaired vision will find it difficult while finding path or avoiding obstacles, and must ask for auxiliary tools for help. Although traditional aids such as guide canes and guide dogs exist, they still have some shortcomings. In this paper, we present our wearable blind guiding device, what perform navigation guidance through our proposed Gait-based Guiding System. Our device innovatively integrates gait phase analysis for walking guide, and in terms of environmental perception, we use multimodal sensing to acquire diverse environment information. During the experiment, we conducted both indoor and outdoor experiments, and compared with the standard guide cane. The result shows superior performance of our device in blind guidance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework, referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain. Code of the model is available at https://github.com/gaurav00700/Selfsupervised-NVSF

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules, VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable object and motion representations.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field of scene understanding involving people.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos. Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images), DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2 images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58, and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90, and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets, DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to the Earth science community.

arXiv:2506.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/astlian9/SAM_Support.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task, while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images, alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling. Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG. Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use. Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

<title>UltraAD: Fine-Grained Ultrasound Anomaly Classification via Few-Shot CLIP Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Systematic Comparison of Projection Methods for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation on Fisheye Images</title>

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups, ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at: https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/fishnchips

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on our website https://colezwhy.github.io/coco4d/.

<title>One Prototype Is Enough: Single-Prototype Activation for Interpretable Image Classification</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning. This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the information association between the prototype and the training image patches while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at https://github.com/pyt19/ProtoSolo.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what' together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise, fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

<title>Improving Progressive Generation with Decomposable Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution. Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

<title>Active View Selector: Fast and Accurate Active View Selection with Cross Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable, full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context. Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components. Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM) and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance. Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention, while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future work.

arXiv:2506.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training, UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for category-agnostic 3D animation.

<title>Radial Attention: $O(n\log n)$ Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for Long Video Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale, diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models' ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models (LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at https://github.com/msu-video-group/NIC-RobustBench.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary, often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to 66 different labs for routine H&amp;E staining. To isolate staining variation, other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely, histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied training data

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

<title>A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images</title>

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings, it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric, strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels. Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities. Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI. The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI, 13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing - using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum, and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies for real-world applications.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection. Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space) and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/sot176/Longitudinal_Mammogram_Alignment.git.

<title>NAADA: A Noise-Aware Attention Denoising Autoencoder for Dental Panoramic Radiographs</title>

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering. Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its impact on desktop and mobile devices.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays, which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels. The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is available at https://github.com/zfw-cv/AngioDiff.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM) that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL. Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models (VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations. Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for embodied agents in real-world settings.

<title>Learning from Anatomy: Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for Improved Metastatic Bone Disease Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI</title>

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise, and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models, achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24 (baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32 patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings. Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its potential for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

<title>NeRF-based CBCT Reconstruction needs Normalization and Initialization</title>

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging. However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training, slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI) strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets, covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent. Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and 4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported 80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation. Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

<title>CronusVLA: Transferring Latent Motion Across Time for Multi-Frame Prediction in Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2) multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with 70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as indoor parking structures or dense urban canyons, achieving accurate and robust vehicle positioning remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a cost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integrates monocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration (VMR) with 3-D digital maps. Extensive testing in real-world indoor and outdoor driving scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system, achieving sub-meter accuracy of 92% indoors and more than 80% outdoors, with consistent horizontal positioning and heading average root mean-square errors of approximately 0.98 m and 1.25 {\deg}, respectively. Compared to the baselines examined, the proposed solution significantly reduced drift and improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the potential of cost-effective monocular vision systems combined with 3D maps for scalable, GNSS-independent navigation in land vehicles.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal action localization consists of three levels of tasks: spatial localization, action classification, and temporal localization. In this work, we propose a new progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework that improves all three tasks above. The basic idea is to utilize both spatial region (resp., temporal segment proposals) and features from one stream (i.e., the Flow/RGB stream) to help another stream (i.e., the RGB/Flow stream) to iteratively generate better bounding boxes in the spatial domain (resp., temporal segments in the temporal domain). In this way, not only the actions could be more accurately localized both spatially and temporally, but also the action classes could be predicted more precisely. Specifically, we first combine the latest region proposals (for spatial detection) or segment proposals (for temporal localization) from both streams to form a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection or segment detection models. Second, to learn better representations, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream, which also leads to better action detection and segment detection models. By first using our newly proposed PCSC framework for spatial localization at the frame-level and then applying our temporal PCSC framework for temporal localization at the tube-level, the action localization results are progressively improved at both the frame level and the video level. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing faces significant challenges when considering training and inference flexibility. Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models have been proposed to avoid data collection, but they are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing. Code is available at https://github.com/Yueming6568/DeltaEdit.

Abstract: High-quality annotation of fine-grained visual categories demands great expert knowledge, which is taxing and time consuming. Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution. However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform poorly on data that differs from their training set. Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++ outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel. ALDI and ALDI++ are architecture-agnostic, setting a new state-of-the-art for YOLO and DETR-based DAOD as well without additional hyperparameter tuning. Our framework, dataset, and state-of-the-art method offer a critical reset for DAOD and provide a strong foundation for future research.

Abstract: Large-scale ''foundation models'' have gained traction as a way to leverage the vast amounts of unlabeled remote sensing data collected every day. However, due to the multiplicity of Earth Observation satellites, these models should learn ''sensor agnostic'' representations, that generalize across sensor characteristics with minimal fine-tuning. This is complicated by data availability, as low-resolution imagery, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data, are available in large amounts, while very high-resolution aerial or satellite data is less common. To tackle these challenges, we introduce cross-sensor self-supervised training and alignment for remote sensing (X-STARS). We design a self-supervised training loss, the Multi-Sensor Alignment Dense loss (MSAD), to align representations across sensors, even with vastly different resolutions. Our X-STARS can be applied to train models from scratch, or to adapt large models pretrained on e.g low-resolution EO data to new high-resolution sensors, in a continual pretraining framework. We collect and release MSC-France, a new multi-sensor dataset, on which we train our X-STARS models, then evaluated on seven downstream classification and segmentation tasks. We demonstrate that X-STARS outperform s the state-of-the-art by a significant margin with less data across various conditions of data availability and resolutions.

Abstract: With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing interest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text prompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining complex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a novel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D generation. Unlike current 4D generation methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular videos or mesh sequences as motion prompts, enabling precise and customizable motion control. MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: (i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module, which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase extracts the 3D motion (skeleton poses) using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility. Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss that aligns the overall distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the supervision while maintaining part-level alignment without extra annotations. (ii) Cross-category Motion Transfer Module, which leverages the extracted motion from the 4D reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve cross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames through dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation, outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.

Abstract: As a promising field in open-world learning, \textit{Novel Class Discovery} (NCD) is usually a task to cluster unseen novel classes in an unlabeled set based on the prior knowledge of labeled data within the same domain. However, the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones. In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD with cross domain setting under the necessary condition that the style information needs to be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed style removal strategy.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, current methods exhibit limited performance mainly due to the scarcity of high-quality data, the insufficient utilization of facial dynamics, and the ambiguity of expression semantics, etc. To this end, we propose a novel framework, named Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with AdaptERs (FineCLIPER), incorporating the following novel designs: 1) To better distinguish between similar facial expressions, we extend the class labels to textual descriptions from both positive and negative aspects, and obtain supervision by calculating the cross-modal similarity based on the CLIP model; 2) Our FineCLIPER adopts a hierarchical manner to effectively mine useful cues from DFE videos. Specifically, besides directly embedding video frames as input (low semantic level), we propose to extract the face segmentation masks and landmarks based on each frame (middle semantic level) and utilize the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to further generate detailed descriptions of facial changes across frames with designed prompts (high semantic level). Additionally, we also adopt Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to enable efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models (i.e., CLIP) for this task. Our FineCLIPER achieves SOTA performance on the DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW datasets in both supervised and zero-shot settings with few tunable parameters.

Abstract: Multimodal image fusion and semantic segmentation are critical for autonomous driving. Despite advancements, current models often struggle with segmenting densely packed elements due to a lack of comprehensive fusion features for guidance during training. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) allows precise control during fine-tuning through its flexible prompting encoder, its potential remains largely unexplored in the context of multimodal segmentation for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules. This approach transforms the training methodology for multimodal segmentation from a traditional black-box approach to a controllable, prompt-based mechanism. Specifically, we obtain latent space features for both modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We then use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 4.1$\%$ over the state-of-the-art method in segmentation mIoU, and the performance is also optimized in other multi-modal visual scenes.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.

Abstract: We introduce BrainSAIL, a method for linking neural selectivity with spatially distributed semantic visual concepts in natural scenes. BrainSAIL leverages recent advances in large-scale artificial neural networks, using them to provide insights into the functional topology of the brain. To overcome the challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural images, BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. This provides a powerful tool for dissecting the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic visual processing for natural images. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts. Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth, luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the human brain.

<title>TD-Paint: Faster Diffusion Inpainting Through Time Aware Pixel Conditioning</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as highly effective techniques for inpainting, however, they remain constrained by slow sampling rates. While recent advances have enhanced generation quality, they have also increased sampling time, thereby limiting scalability in real-world applications. We investigate the generative sampling process of diffusion-based inpainting models and observe that these models make minimal use of the input condition during the initial sampling steps. As a result, the sampling trajectory deviates from the data manifold, requiring complex synchronization mechanisms to realign the generation process. To address this, we propose Time-aware Diffusion Paint (TD-Paint), a novel approach that adapts the diffusion process by modeling variable noise levels at the pixel level. This technique allows the model to efficiently use known pixel values from the start, guiding the generation process toward the target manifold. By embedding this information early in the diffusion process, TD-Paint significantly accelerates sampling without compromising image quality. Unlike conventional diffusion-based inpainting models, which require a dedicated architecture or an expensive generation loop, TD-Paint achieves faster sampling times without architectural modifications. Experimental results across three datasets show that TD-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models while maintaining lower complexity.

Abstract: Sign language is a visual language expressed through hand movements and non-manual markers. Non-manual markers include facial expressions and head movements. These expressions vary across different nations. Therefore, specialized analysis methods for each sign language are necessary. However, research on Japanese Sign Language (JSL) recognition is limited due to a lack of datasets. The development of recognition models that consider both manual and non-manual features of JSL is crucial for precise and smooth communication with deaf individuals. In JSL, sentence types such as affirmative statements and questions are distinguished by facial expressions. In this paper, we propose a JSL recognition method that focuses on facial expressions. Our proposed method utilizes a neural network to analyze facial features and classify sentence types. Through the experiments, we confirm our method's effectiveness by achieving a classification accuracy of 96.05%.

Abstract: This study aims to achieve more precise and versatile object control in image-to-video (I2V) generation. Current methods typically represent the spatial movement of target objects with 2D trajectories, which often fail to capture user intention and frequently produce unnatural results. To enhance control, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that uses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as a control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D represents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object motion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model (CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for global motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to isolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local control. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate object control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's region across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D significantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free methods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based approaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object rotation. Code and results are available at https://wzhouxiff.github.io/projects/ObjCtrl-2.5D/.

Abstract: Constrained by the low-rank bottleneck inherent in attention mechanisms, current stereo matching transformers suffer from limited nonlinear expressivity, which renders their feature representations sensitive to challenging conditions such as reflections. To overcome this difficulty, we present the Hadamard Attention Recurrent Stereo Transformer (HART). HART includes a novel attention mechanism that incorporates the following components: 1) The Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) maps the attention weight distribution into a high-dimensional space over (0, +$\infty$). By removing the upper bound constraint on attention weights, DAK enables more flexible modeling of complex feature interactions. This reduces feature collinearity. 2) The Multi Kernel & Order Interaction (MKOI) module extends the attention mechanism by unifying semantic and spatial knowledge learning. This integration improves the ability of HART to learn features in binocular images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART. In reflective area, HART ranked 1st on the KITTI 2012 benchmark among all published methods at the time of submission. Code is available at https://github.com/ZYangChen/HART.

<title>DivTrackee versus DynTracker: Promoting Diversity in Anti-Facial Recognition against Dynamic FR Strategy</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of facial recognition (FR) models raises serious concerns about their potential misuse, motivating the development of anti-facial recognition (AFR) to protect user facial privacy. In this paper, we argue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature for evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual capabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target identity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where the model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized target identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the existing AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by DynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected images. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the failure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel method for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided image generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through comprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors, we demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the superiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being identified by dynamic FR strategies. We believe our work can act as an important initial step towards developing more effective AFR methods for protecting user facial privacy against determined trackers.

<title>Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models</title>

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive generation has emerged as a new powerful paradigm with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for a higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. We release the code at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars for reproducibility.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A key challenge in model-free category-level pose estimation is the extraction of contextual object features that generalize across varying instances within a specific category. Recent approaches leverage foundational features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275.

Abstract: Incorporating geometric invariance into neural networks enhances parameter efficiency but typically increases computational costs. This paper introduces new equivariant neural networks that preserve symmetry while maintaining a comparable number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per parameter to standard non-equivariant networks. We focus on horizontal mirroring (flopping) invariance, common in many computer vision tasks. The main idea is to parametrize the feature spaces in terms of mirror-symmetric and mirror-antisymmetric features, i.e., irreps of the flopping group. This decomposes the linear layers to be block-diagonal, requiring half the number of FLOPs. Our approach reduces both FLOPs and wall-clock time, providing a practical solution for efficient, scalable symmetry-aware architectures.

Abstract: In the age of AI-driven generative technologies, traditional biometric recognition systems face unprecedented challenges, particularly from sophisticated deepfake and face reenactment techniques. In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.

Abstract: The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, Non-negative Implicit Neural Representation Factorization (\texttt{NINRF}), based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with continuous functions and we propose using implicit neural representations (INRs) to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods, while giving continuous representations for object's detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.

Abstract: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) is a cornerstone for environmental perception in robotic systems and autonomous driving, enabling precise scene understanding through point-wise classification. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.

Abstract: Anime video generation faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of anime data and unusual motion patterns, leading to issues such as motion distortion and flickering artifacts, which result in misalignment with human preferences. Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/bilibili/Index-anisora.

Abstract: Deep learning based rendering has achieved major improvements in photo-realistic image synthesis, with potential applications including visual effects in movies and photo-realistic scene building in video games. However, a significant limitation is the difficulty of decomposing the illumination and material parameters, which limits such methods to reconstructing an input scene, without any possibility to control these parameters. This paper introduces a novel physics based neural deferred shading pipeline to decompose the data-driven rendering process, learn a generalizable shading function to produce photo-realistic results for shading and relighting tasks; we also propose a shadow estimator to efficiently mimic shadowing effects. Our model achieves improved performance compared to classical models and a state-of-art neural shading model, and enables generalizable photo-realistic shading from arbitrary illumination input.

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across any set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse STS configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.

Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition, motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general, convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a computer controlled stage.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens, we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics. Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines in both automated evaluations and human studies.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network (RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence, we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/ soon.

<title>Grounding Beyond Detection: Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Embodied 3D Grounding</title>

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

<title>VideoMathQA: Benchmarking Mathematical Reasoning via Multimodal Understanding in Videos</title>

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress using large-scale textual data, but the potential of incorporating multimodal inputs, especially visual information, remains underexplored in high-resource settings. While prior research has focused on using multimodal data in low-resource scenarios, this study examines how image features impact translation when added to a large-scale, pre-trained unimodal NMT system. Surprisingly, the study finds that images might be redundant in this context. Additionally, the research introduces synthetic noise to assess whether images help the model handle textual noise. Multimodal models slightly outperform text-only models in noisy settings, even when random images are used. The study's experiments translate from English to Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks. Interestingly, the effect of visual context varies with the level of source text noise: no visual context works best for non-noisy translations, cropped image features are optimal for low noise, and full image features perform better in high-noise scenarios. This sheds light on the role of visual context, especially in noisy settings, and opens up a new research direction for Noisy Neural Machine Translation in multimodal setups. The research emphasizes the importance of combining visual and textual information to improve translation across various environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/babangain/indicMMT.

Abstract: We propose SemGauss-SLAM, a dense semantic SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian representation, that enables accurate 3D semantic mapping, robust camera tracking, and high-quality rendering simultaneously. In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment. By leveraging multi-frame semantic associations, this strategy enables joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, resulting in low-drift tracking and accurate semantic mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.

Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis. Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.

Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert annotations. Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency, GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised $\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$ images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases (multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets (spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.

<title>Improved and Explainable Cervical Cancer Classification using Ensemble Pooling of Block Fused Descriptors</title>

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and causes high death rates. Earlier models for detecting cervical cancer had limited success. In this work, we propose new models that substantially outperform previous models.
  Previous studies show that pretrained ResNets extract features from cervical cancer images well. Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets (50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes, objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges, texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features. Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets. This type of combination is also new in cancer classification domain (also in cervical cancer), and results in our third and fourth models, respectively. We use a linear SVM for classification.
  We exhaustively perform experiments on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv, achieving an average performance of 97.92% and 92.97% surpassing standard ResNets performance of 90.89% and 87.97%, respectively. We outperform the competitive approach available on IARC dataset with an average gain of 13.20%, while no prior competitive work available on AnnoCerv. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases.

Abstract: E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text, together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product retrieval.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics are driving real-world autonomy for long-term and large-scale missions, where loop closures via place recognition are vital for mitigating pose estimation drift. However, achieving real-time performance remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile robots and multi-robot systems due to the computational burden of high-density sampling, which increases the complexity of comparing and verifying query samples against a growing map database. Conventional methods often retain redundant information or miss critical data by relying on fixed sampling intervals or operating in 3-D space instead of the descriptor feature space. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of sample space and propose a novel keyframe sampling approach for LiDAR-based place recognition. Our method minimizes redundancy while preserving essential information in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space, supporting both learning-based and handcrafted descriptors. The proposed approach incorporates a sliding window optimization strategy to ensure efficient keyframe selection and real-time performance, enabling seamless integration into robotic pipelines. In sum, our approach demonstrates robust performance across diverse datasets, with the ability to adapt seamlessly from indoor to outdoor scenarios without parameter tuning, reducing loop closure detection times and memory requirements.

Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce Learned Augmented Residual Layer (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using LAuReL can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves 60% of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding 0.003% more parameters, and matches it while adding 2.6 times fewer parameters. Similarly, when pre-training 1B and 4B parameter LLMs, LAuReL improves performance on a variety of challenging downstream evaluation tasks by 2.54% to 20.05%, while adding only 0.012% and 0.1% additional parameters, respectively.

Abstract: We propose end-to-end differentiable model that predicts robot trajectories on rough offroad terrain from camera images and/or lidar point clouds. The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

<div> Keywords: semi-supervised semantic segmentation, uncertainty, pseudo-labeling, class imbalance, contrastive regularization

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation that addresses challenges in leveraging unlabeled data. The framework includes four key components: fuzzy pseudo-labeling to enrich supervision, uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting for pixel-wise contributions, adaptive class rebalancing to counteract class imbalances, and lightweight contrastive regularization for feature embeddings. By transforming uncertainty into a learning asset, the framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. It effectively handles under-represented classes and ambiguous regions, achieving significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The approach allows for the preservation of soft class distributions, modulation of pixel-wise contributions based on reliability scores, dynamic adjustment of losses for long-tailed class distributions, and encouragement of compact and discriminative feature embeddings. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Summary: <br />
This study compared a deep-learning smartphone-based eye-tracking algorithm with a commercial infrared eye tracker, evaluating its performance under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key factors such as age, gender, vision correction, lighting, device type, and head position were analyzed. The algorithm, integrating MobileNet-V3 and Long Short-Term Memory, predicted gaze coordinates from facial images with a mean error of 17.76 mm, slightly higher than the Tobii Pro Nano. However, sensitivity to factors like lighting, vision correction, and age was observed, especially in low-light conditions for glasses-wearers and older participants. Device-specific and positional factors also affected tracking accuracy. These findings suggest promise for appearance-based gaze estimation on mobile devices but also highlight the need for further research and refinement to account for varying usage conditions. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker, the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of 17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

<div> alignment, multimodal reasoning, vision-language models, linear adapter, sparse autoencoders

Summary:
- Effective multimodal reasoning relies on aligning visual and linguistic representations in vision-language models.
- The study uses the LiMBeR framework to maintain frozen large language and vision transformers connected through a linear adapter.
- By keeping the language model frozen, direct mapping of visual features is required into the existing language representational space.
- Pre-trained sparse autoencoders serve as analytical probes to reveal the gradual alignment of visual representations with language features in later layers.
- The findings suggest a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, questioning the optimal facilitation of cross-modal representation learning with current adapter-based architectures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.11976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. Following the LiMBeR framework, we deliberately maintain a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. By keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

<div> large language-vision-speech model, modality alignments, efficient, flexible, multimodal interaction
Summary:
Stream-Omni is a large language-vision-speech model designed to support more flexible multimodal interaction by efficiently aligning vision and speech modalities with text. It employs large language models as the backbone and aligns vision and speech based on their relationships with text. For vision, it uses sequence-dimension concatenation for alignment, while for speech, it utilizes a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping. This approach allows Stream-Omni to achieve strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. By providing intermediate text outputs during speech interaction, Stream-Omni offers users a comprehensive multimodal experience. Additionally, Stream-Omni requires less data, especially for speech, enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. <div>
arXiv:2506.13642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience.

Summary: 
This study analyzes diffusion models at a circuit-level to understand the computational pathways and mechanisms involved in image generation processes. Through experiments with synthetic and CelebA facial images, the research uncovers algorithmic differences in how diffusion architectures handle synthetic versus naturalistic data distributions. Real-world face processing requires circuits with higher computational complexity, with distinct attention specialization patterns observed. Different attention mechanisms such as edge detection, texture analysis, and semantic understanding play specialized computational roles. Intervention analysis reveals critical computational bottlenecks where targeted ablations lead to performance degradation, providing causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings lay the groundwork for a quantitative understanding and control of generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models, establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000 synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity (complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to 0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection (entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus 0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15). Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces SRKD, a Structure- and Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for efficient 3D point cloud segmentation. By transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, SRKD addresses computational complexity issues. The framework includes a relation alignment module that enhances the student's contextual understanding through similarity matching. A cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy helps the student learn stable geometric structures across different instances. Semantic distribution alignment using KL divergence and ground-truth supervision further improves segmentation accuracy. With reduced model complexity, SRKD achieves state-of-the-art performance, making it suitable for real-world deployment scenarios. This innovative approach provides an efficient and effective solution for complex 3D segmentation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M) to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching, enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile, we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios.

<div> Machine Learning, Soil Mapping, Permafrost, Alaska, Climate Change

Summary:
The article introduces MISO, a vision-based machine learning model for fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska. This model aims to create high-resolution soil maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy, essential for understanding permafrost distribution and identifying vulnerable areas. MISO outperforms the traditional Random Forest model, showing better generalization to remote locations and higher recall, crucial for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes. The study showcases the potential of advanced machine learning approaches for soil mapping and offers practical guidance for future soil sampling and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project code will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes. These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

- The framework utilizes radar chart images encoding day-level behavioral features and combines a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM for comprehensive analysis.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

<div> Keywords: fall detection, elderly people, multimodal sensing, privacy-preserving, bathroom environments

Summary:
A new Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments is proposed in response to the increasing fall risk faced by the aging population. The system combines millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing to overcome the limitations of unimodal systems and deliver improved accuracy in complex environments. A dual-stream network, P2MFDS, is introduced, incorporating a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch and a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch to capture both macro- and micro-scale features for enhanced fall detection. The system is designed to be non-intrusive, privacy-preserving, and effective in real bathroom settings, where most falls occur. A sensor evaluation framework is developed to select and fuse the appropriate sensors, and a large-scale multimodal dataset in real bathroom settings is constructed for training and evaluation purposes. The code and pretrained models will be publicly available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2506.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk, particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80 percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments. These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing, including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments. First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features, P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at: https://github.com/HaitianWang/P2MFDS-A-Privacy-Preserving-Multimodal-Fall-Detection-Network-for-Elderly-Individuals-in-Bathroom.

<div> Keywords: autonomous vehicles, data quality, task-centric framework, multimodal data, redundancy detection

Summary: 
The paper introduces a task-centric framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that emphasizes the importance of data quality (DQ) in decision-making. AVs rely on various sources of data but often overlook the varying quality of these sources. The proposed framework comprises five layers to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals, aiming to enhance the functionality, efficiency, and trustworthiness of AVs. A case study shows that addressing redundancy in multisource image data can improve object detection task performance. Analysis on image and LiDAR data further identifies redundancy issues, highlighting the need for a more adaptive and resilient AV system. The framework addresses critical challenges at the intersection of DQ, task orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. The paper provides code, data, and implementation details for further exploration in the AV community. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality, efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8 object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable, and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and heterogeneous data streams.

arXiv:2506.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction.

Summary:<br />
Efficient extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for digital manufacturing workflows. Manual extraction is slow, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts and symbols. To address this, a hybrid vision-language framework is proposed, integrating YOLOv11-obb for object detection and a transformer-based parser. A dataset of 1,367 drawings is curated, and YOLOv11-OBB is trained to detect annotations. Two lightweight VLMs, Donut and Florence-2, are fine-tuned on the dataset for parsing. Donut outperforms Florence-2 with high precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework's practical utility is demonstrated in a case study showcasing how the extracted information supports manufacturing tasks. This approach modernizes 2D drawing interpretation, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in digital manufacturing workflows.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), measures, material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts, engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB) patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned, lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing interpretation.

The limited availability of labeled data makes prediction challenging, but STPT leverages both labeled and unlabeled data. STPT overcomes challenges in embryo development videos by using a two-stage approach: spatial and temporal. By training only one encoder at a time, STPT reduces memory demands, efficiently handling long videos and temporal variability. STPT avoids frame-by-frame alignment across videos, learning from alignments within each video and its augmentations. On a dataset of 23,027 time-lapse videos, STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 compared to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286 labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach, Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN), combined with a state-space model and LSTM-like memory mechanisms, to enhance breast cancer risk prediction models. By leveraging rich temporal dynamics in longitudinal imaging data, the model effectively captures evolving trends in breast tissue. Additionally, an asymmetry module incorporating a Spatial Asymmetry Detector and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker is implemented to identify bilateral differences relevant for early cancer detection. The integrated framework shows improved performance, particularly in high-density breast cases, and achieves superior prediction accuracy at extended time points. This advancement has the potential to enhance early breast cancer recognition and enable personalized screening strategies. The code for this approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector (SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Trans-CBCT and Trans$^2$-CBCT models for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based geometry reasoning. Trans-CBCT surpasses baselines on the LUNA16 dataset by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM, improving spatial coverage despite under-sampling artifacts. The addition of the Neighbor-aware Point Transformer enhances volumetric coherence, resulting in further gains of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM on dental datasets like ToothFairy. These models are effective in reconstructing CBCT images from as few as six views, making faster scans with lower radiation dose feasible. The hybrid approach of Convolutional and Transformer layers enables capturing local details and enhancing global context for better reconstruction quality. <div>

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model. Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features, querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views. Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT, provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner. This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%, and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and classification in complex wireless environments.

Summary:
Anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems is crucial for safety, but existing methods often prioritize accuracy over response time. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras for real-time anomaly detection. The proposed multimodal asynchronous hybrid network leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates spatial features from RGB images using a CNN.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, few-shot adaptation, medical image analysis, imbalanced data, linear probe <br />
Summary: 
Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining traction in medical image analysis due to their transferable representations. However, existing methods for few-shot adaptation make unrealistic assumptions about data distribution, such as balanced support sets and access to a validation set. This study challenges these assumptions by introducing a realistic, imbalanced, and validation-free adaptation setting. Results show that current methods struggle under these conditions, sometimes performing worse than zero-shot inference. Additionally, a training-free linear probe is proposed to blend visual and textual supervision adaptively, serving as a strong baseline for robust adaptation in challenging scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions. However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain. First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in challenging scenarios.

Summary: This study explores the use of the split conformal prediction framework to provide reliability guarantees for transferring medical vision-language models with limited labeled data. The research introduces transductive split conformal adaptation, a novel approach that adapts the model on both calibration and test data simultaneously. Experiments across various medical image modalities and transfer tasks show that the proposed framework improves efficiency and maintains empirical guarantees compared to traditional methods. This method addresses the challenge of maintaining exchangeability assumptions for test data in conformal prediction, offering consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage. <div>
arXiv:2506.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T), a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data. We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP, maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

This article introduces a new framework for personalized golf swing analysis using data from a single wrist-worn sensor. The framework includes a large dataset of professional golf swings, full-body 3D kinematics reconstruction, and synthetic inertial data generation for training neural networks. It identifies motion primitives to detect technical flaws and predict player characteristics accurately. The system can estimate full-body kinematics, segment swing phases, and provide actionable feedback on-course, supporting skill improvement and injury prevention.

This work bridges biomechanics research and field applications, offering scalable and high-fidelity motion analysis for coaching and research purposes. It also opens up new possibilities in movement-based phenotyping, personalized equipment design, and motor skill development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible, high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention, while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized equipment design, and motor skill development.

<div> reinforcement learning, 3D scene understanding, video-grounded framework, transparent reasoning, annotation-efficient<br />
Summary:<br />
Scene-R1 is a new framework for understanding 3D scenes using large language models. It aims to provide transparent reasoning by using reinforcement learning and a two-stage grounding pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, relevant video snippets are selected for an open-ended query, followed by analyzing the image and predicting 2D bounding boxes in the image grounding stage. Object tracking with SAM2 generates pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, eliminating the need for 3D detectors. Scene-R1 excels in open-vocabulary tasks and can adapt to 3D visual question answering. This framework only requires task-level 2D boxes or textual labels for training, making it annotation-efficient. By leveraging RGB-D video, Scene-R1 offers a practical and trustworthy approach to 3D scene understanding without the need for dense 3D point-wise labels.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies, often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive biases for computer vision.

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.

<div> Federated Learning, Medical Report Generation, Privacy-Preserving, Communication-Efficient, Multi-Center

Summary: 
FedMRG is a framework that uses Federated Learning to develop Medical Report Generation (MRG) models while preserving privacy and efficiency. It addresses the challenge of communication overhead by reducing gradient transmission costs through low-rank factorization. The framework also tackles the dual heterogeneity in MRG by incorporating client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder and a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder to accommodate variations in image characteristics and reporting styles. FedMRG shows promising results in generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency, making it a valuable tool for leveraging multi-center data in MRG model development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

<div> hallucinations, Large Vision-Language Models, architecture-level solution, recurrent cross-layer reasoning, Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU)

Summary: 
The paper introduces HalluRNN, an architecture-level solution to address hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models. The approach utilizes a Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module shared across layers to enhance model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. This module refines hidden states adaptively, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, the proposed HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks. The method does not require extensive resources or task-specific configurations, making it a cost-effective solution for improving the performance of LVLMs and reducing hallucinations in model output. <div>

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they are still prone to hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks.

Summary:
DRAMA-X is a new benchmark focused on understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists in safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving. The benchmark includes accident-prone frames with annotations for object detection, directional intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion for the ego vehicle. The proposed SGG-Intent framework utilizes vision-language models to reason through these tasks, showing improved performance in intent prediction and risk assessment when incorporating contextual cues. Experiment results highlight the effectiveness of scene-graph-based reasoning in enhancing decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

<div> Face identity, deepfake detection, SELFI framework, forgery-aware identity adapter, identity-aware fusion module <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Identity features play a crucial role in deepfake detection, but their effectiveness varies depending on the manipulation method. While some manipulations preserve identity cues, others distort them, affecting generalization. To address this, SELFI framework is introduced, which adaptively controls and integrates identity features based on their relevance. It includes a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) for extracting forgery-relevant identity embeddings and an Identity-Aware Fusion Module (IAFM) for selective integration of visual and identity features. SELFI outperforms existing methods in cross-manipulation generalization, showing an improvement of 3.1% AUC on four benchmarks and 6% on the challenging DFDC dataset. The code for SELFI will be released upon acceptance of the paper. <div>
arXiv:2506.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence. To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI} (\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Summary:<br />
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a challenging condition that requires early detection. Current in vitro diagnostic methods face limitations, such as insufficient training data for facial expression diagnosis and the need for specialized equipment for gait diagnosis. To address these issues, a novel multimodal diagnostic method leveraging facial expressions and behavioral gait is proposed. The method utilizes a lightweight deep learning model for feature extraction and fusion to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable deployment on mobile devices. The development of the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital allows for extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This approach aims to overcome the challenges associated with existing diagnostic methods and improve the accuracy of PD diagnosis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2) specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis, resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Summary:
Our study aimed to develop an interpretable and robust age prediction model for brain MRI scans. We utilized a transformer-based architecture with self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets, processing pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from multiple views and incorporating brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduced complexity for scalability. Training on ADNI2 & 3 and OASIS3 datasets, we achieved a mean absolute error of 3.65 years and demonstrated high generalizability on the AIBL dataset with an MAE of 3.54 years. We observed increasing brain age gaps across cognitive groups, with significant correlations between brain age gap and cognitive scores. Gradient-based feature attribution highlighted key regions influenced by brain aging. Overall, our model achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, improved generalizability, and interpretability with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity, enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia. Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15 years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12 years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of -0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused information from different views and volumetric information to achieve state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling, enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a 60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

Summary:
Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) aims to understand and follow complex instructions in dynamic environments using egocentric video. Existing solutions face challenges due to the diversity of instructions and spatiotemporal dynamics in videos. To address this, the CLiViS framework combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visual perception. CLiViS utilizes a dynamic Cognitive Map to represent the scene, facilitating stepwise reasoning. The framework does not require training and demonstrates effectiveness across different benchmarks, particularly in handling long-term visual dependencies. The code for CLiViS is available for further exploration on GitHub.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs) over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS, especially in handling long-term visual dependencies.

<div> Keywords: Stereo Depth Estimation, Adversarial Attacks, Transferability, PatchHunter, Reinforcement Learning

Summary:
Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is crucial for various vision-based systems, including autonomous driving. Recent research highlights the vulnerability of SDE models to adversarial attacks, prompting the need for realistic and physically realizable attack strategies. The authors introduce a unified attack framework that targets key stages of stereo matching, demonstrating the limitations of traditional optimization-based techniques. They propose PatchHunter, an optimization-free adversarial patch attack that leverages reinforcement learning to disrupt SDE assumptions with structured visual patterns. PatchHunter outperforms optimization-based methods in effectiveness across different datasets and simulation environments, showcasing superior black-box transferability. Even in challenging physical conditions such as low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success rates where traditional methods fail, making it a promising advancement in defending against adversarial attacks in SDE systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency, reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability. Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4), whereas optimization-based methods fail.

Summary:
The study focuses on few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where only a few labeled in-distribution (ID) samples are available. The proposed Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network (AMCN) addresses the challenge by learning inter- and intra-class distribution to adapt the ID-OOD separation boundary leveraging CLIP connecting text with images. Adaptive prompts including learnable ID prompts and various OOD prompts are generated to compensate for the absence of OOD samples. An adaptive class boundary is introduced for each class through prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module controlling the margin between ID and OOD prompts. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AMCN over existing state-of-the-art methods. <br /><br />Summary: The study introduces AMCN for few-shot OOD detection using adaptive prompts generated with CLIP to enhance the ID-OOD separation boundary and control the margin between prompts. The approach outperforms current methods in experimental evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenging few-shot OOD detection scenario. <div>
arXiv:2506.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter- and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images, engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external tools.

<div> Keywords: Convolutional neural networks, target detection, self-attention mechanism, global context modeling, scale-adaptive detection 

Summary:
The paper introduces the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a transformed-based detection header inspired by natural language processing and human visual perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize CNN backbone network characteristics by replacing traditional self-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism allows regions of interest to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information, improving global context modeling and adaptability to objects of different sizes. CSDN can replace native heads of CNN-based detectors with minimal fine-tuning on pre-training weights, leading to significant detection accuracy improvements without extensive re-training of layer modules. The re-evaluation of the DETR-inspired header network questions the necessity of self-attention mechanisms, highlighting information redundancies that CSDN aims to address. <div>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers, captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG, introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action recognition.

<div> 3D point cloud, video diffusion model, perpetual view generation, camera movements, object dynamics
<br />
DreamJourney introduces a two-stage framework for perpetual view generation, combining 3D awareness with object dynamics. In the first stage, the input image is converted to a 3D point cloud and partial images are rendered from a specific camera trajectory. A video diffusion model completes missing regions and enhances visual coherence, producing cross-view consistent videos. Simple strategies like early stopping and view padding improve stability and visual quality. In the second stage, a language model generates text prompts for object movements, which are then animated using the video diffusion model. This process is repeated iteratively to generate perpetual dynamic scene views. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DreamJourney over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement. However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static 3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world. To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to 3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence, producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page: https://dream-journey.vercel.app.

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules. Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously. Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new deep learning approach, the Pattern Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net), for accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) on MRI images. The PDC-Net addresses challenges such as complex organ morphologies and confusing context by utilizing different network modules. The Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module enhances shape fitting by applying strip convolutions in four directions, specifically targeting strip-like or circular-like ROI structures. The Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module tracks cross-image patterns at the dataset level to improve distinction between global patterns. The Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) dynamically selects features based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to generate segmentation results. Experimental results on a large-scale PRI dataset demonstrate the superiority of the PDC-Net compared to existing methods. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest (ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

Summary:
YOLOv13 is introduced as an accurate and lightweight object detector that addresses the limitations of its predecessors. It incorporates the Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations for improved detection performance in complex scenarios. The Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm distributes correlation-enhanced features throughout the network, enhancing information flow and representation synergy. YOLOv13 utilizes depthwise separable convolutions to reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO benchmark show that YOLOv13 outperforms previous versions, with YOLOv13-N improving mAP by 3.0% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models for YOLOv13 are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models of our YOLOv13 model are available at: https://github.com/iMoonLab/yolov13.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics.

The framework utilizes layer-wise mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners, dynamically routing data to the most suitable expert.

arXiv:2506.17787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness metrics.

<div> Keywords: In-context learning, self-supervised learning, video object segmentation, prompt retriever, visual applications

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a new approach called Temporal for in-context learning (ICL) in visual applications. Traditional ICL methods rely on grid-based strategies that limit the flexibility in context images. Temporal addresses this limitation by formulating ICL as a video object segmentation task, allowing for a variable number of context images with full resolution. The key innovation of Temporal is the use of a prompt retriever pretrained via self-supervised learning on videos. This retriever selects relevant sequences for queries, enabling coherent video processing for segmentation tasks. The method achieves significant improvements over baseline methods on the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset, with a 10.64% increase in Dice score for image segmentation and a 14.88% improvement for video segmentation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy, which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation (VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement) and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

arXiv:2506.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations, it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and general features to accurately separate the components from various types of noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Summary: 
An innovative approach to analyzing fetal body motion and shape in prenatal diagnostics has been developed using a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model. This model, based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL), combines body pose estimation in image space and body shape estimation in canon pose space. By training the model on a large dataset of MRI volumes, it captures body shape and motion over time series, providing enhanced visualization and enabling automated anthropometric measurements. The model demonstrates robustness to motion artifacts and intensity distortions in MRI scans, reducing the impact of incomplete surface observations. Testing on unseen fetal body shapes yielded a surface alignment error of 3.2 mm, showcasing the model's effectiveness in fetal motion and shape analysis. This advancement represents a significant step forward in prenatal diagnostics, offering a valuable tool for clinicians in monitoring fetal development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

<div> Keywords: RGB-thermal data, semantic segmentation, field robots, cross-modal state space modeling, computational efficiency

Summary:<br />
The article introduces CM-SSM, a new architecture for efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation in wild environments for field robots. It leverages cross-modal state space modeling to establish relationships between RGB and thermal data, improving segmentation performance. The framework includes a CM-SS2D module for creating visual sequences and deriving hidden state representations, and a CM-SSA module for integrating global associations with local spatial features. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results on the CART dataset show superior performance with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Generalizability is demonstrated on the PST900 dataset. Overall, CM-SSM offers a promising solution for enhancing semantic segmentation in resource-constrained systems. Codes for implementation are available on GitHub.

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless, multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal 2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However, there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing complex procedural contexts.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces StainPIDR, a stain normalization method for color-variant pathological images. It decouples images into structure and color features, then uses a fixed color vector codebook to map decoupled color features. The structure features are then restained with target color features using a cross-attention mechanism. A template image selection algorithm helps select a template for the target color features. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection algorithm is validated, showing good performance in stain normalization. The code for StainPIDR will be made publicly available. <div>

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices. Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color (decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data. Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of 0.017. These outcomes highlight the framework's effectiveness in producing high-fidelity, spatially and spectrally consistent cloud-free optical images.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features. In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry, widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks. Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However, existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets and source codes are available at https://github.com/UESTC-nnLab/BeltCrack.

<title>EgoWorld: Translating Exocentric View to Egocentric View using Rich Exocentric Observations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17896</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover, EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

<title>PostAlign: Multimodal Grounding as a Corrective Lens for MLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.

<title>Cause-Effect Driven Optimization for Robust Medical Visual Question Answering with Language Biases</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities. Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e., imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing. Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems, that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues, where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First, our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches, establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features. Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images. While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features (e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases. In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed. Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space. In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/Yu-Zhouz/SegChange-R1.

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST). Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover, previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI. The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms, expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and operational settings.

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception. However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and 88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 30.02 FPS.

<title>BPCLIP: A Bottom-up Image Quality Assessment from Distortion to Semantics Based on CLIP</title>

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating 40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while demonstrating greater robustness.

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations, such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy.

Abstract: Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without requiring physical markers or suits, offering increased flexibility and reduced costs compared to traditional systems. However, these advantages often come at the expense of higher computational demands and slower inference, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this technical report, we present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail. Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we support key design decisions through ablation studies.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection. OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection. In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple, plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee, designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data. Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex reasoning. The source code and pre-trained model are available at \href{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleMIX}{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleMIX}.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

<title>CmFNet: Cross-modal Fusion Network for Weakly-supervised Segmentation of Medical Images</title>

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting, delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset (including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists.

<title>CLGRPO: Reasoning Ability Enhancement for Small VLMs</title>

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System, which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4 addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information, projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer, with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of 10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning approach.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood cell images. Our code is available at: https://github.com/riverback/TF-TTI-XMed.

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering, answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all 7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy video-language understanding. Our code is available in https://github.com/longmalongma/MUPA.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture. The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI), employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent contributions of each module. The code is available on https://github.com/Wenzhuo-Liu/TEM3-Learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First, we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision, guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value, detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds. Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection, establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability. Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely, general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts, significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines, especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in medical diagnosis.

The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase, using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV, particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble correlation-based methods are impractical.

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation. Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model. These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective, providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to video-based approaches.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10 classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot, 10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7% has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement. The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise, varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform (FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities. We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment. Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy, varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/youjie-zhou/FMF-SLAM.git.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear, especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF, frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements. Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced clinical workflows.

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad applicability of our method across various materials, including those transparent in the visible spectrum.

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal disorders in under-resourced areas.

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism, which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics, spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

<title>Drive-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Planning in VLMs for Autonomous Driving with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE, featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE) module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG) module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However, in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning. Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations. Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process. Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction, providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a) hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations. Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by 81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6% and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively) surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However, conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions. OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in endoscopy.

Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for selecting important neighboring people to predict the primary person's trajectory. To achieve effective neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training. Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the process with competitive prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm, and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages, respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2% compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values, atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in irrigated agricultural regions.

<title>Escaping the SpuriVerse: Can Large Vision-Language Models Generalize Beyond Seen Spurious Correlations?</title>

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of 124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets, each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364 multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to 78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to the overall image context.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network, enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

<title>NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization for Safe Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse, including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence, discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications, this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants: PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics, effectively balancing safety and usability.

<title>Geometry-Aware Preference Learning for 3D Texture Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but 3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this, we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation from natural language.

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder, emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders, outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods.

<title>BSMamba: Brightness and Semantic Modeling for Long-Range Interaction in Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18346</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in enhancing classification performance.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: We introduce OpenEvents V1, a large-scale benchmark dataset aimed at advancing event-centric vision-language understanding. Unlike conventional image captioning and retrieval datasets that emphasize surface-level descriptions, OpenEvents V1 focuses on contextual and temporal grounding through two primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions and (2) retrieving event-relevant images based on narrative-style textual queries. The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods. We provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for both tasks. OpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing multimodal models capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), yet existing open resources remain limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

arXiv:2506.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically, we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight. This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification, enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas, demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings, which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust, efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical prognosis prediction workflows.

<title>Frequency-Domain Fusion Transformer for Image Inpainting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention. The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes, textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique. Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing, demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

arXiv:2506.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations.

An intriguing challenge arises when agents interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users: supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&amp;E-HER2 staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both H&amp;E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&amp;E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment, as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios, relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation, and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation. Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions, incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation (LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail), respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods, achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/keke-nice/MedTVT-R1.

<title>Enhancing Image Restoration Transformer via Adaptive Translation Equivariance</title>

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs. Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.

Abstract: We propose a method for representing malignant lymphoma pathology images, from high-resolution cell nuclei to low-resolution tissue images, within a single hyperbolic space using self-supervised learning. To capture morphological changes that occur across scales during disease progression, our approach embeds tissue and corresponding nucleus images close to each other based on inclusion relationships. Using the Poincar\'e ball as the feature space enables effective encoding of this hierarchical structure. The learned representations capture both disease state and cell type variations.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the "Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR.

<title>A Set-to-Set Distance Measure in Hyperbolic Space</title>

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic \underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure (HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets. To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

<title>Geometry-aware Distance Measure for Diverse Hierarchical Structures in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures. Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures, with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over 5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic spaces.

<title>Normality Prior Guided Multi-Semantic Fusion Network for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns. Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks. This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues. However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated detailed contextual information are available at: https://github.com/VisualAIKHU/OA-SSL.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring, and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video generation tasks.

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding, executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets. This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning), achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods. Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However, designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2 imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering, resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings, surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing time series.

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused, implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors, SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/gerkbyrd/SpaNN.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive. Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well.

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/BiGen.

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations, enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.

<title>MedSeg-R: Medical Image Segmentation with Clinical Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18669</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the 3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of this tornado using 3DGS.

<title>MCN-SLAM: Multi-Agent Collaborative Neural SLAM with Hybrid Implicit Neural Scene Representation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18678</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source on https://github.com/dtc111111/mcnslam.

<title>MARL-MambaContour: Unleashing Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Active Contour Optimization in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18679</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18679</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

arXiv:2506.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82% GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets. Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for real-world applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0 to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

<title>Deep CNN Face Matchers Inherently Support Revocable Biometric Templates</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18731</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18731</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2) strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based deep CNN backbones.

Abstract: Object tracking in inland waterways plays a crucial role in safe and cost-effective applications, including waterborne transportation, sightseeing tours, environmental monitoring and surface rescue. Our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), equipped with a 4D radar, a monocular camera, a GPS, and an IMU, delivers robust tracking capabilities in complex waterborne environments. By leveraging these sensors, our USV collected comprehensive object tracking data, which we present as USVTrack, the first 4D radar-camera tracking dataset tailored for autonomous driving in new generation waterborne transportation systems. Our USVTrack dataset presents rich scenarios, featuring diverse various waterways, varying times of day, and multiple weather and lighting conditions. Moreover, we present a simple but effective radar-camera matching method, termed RCM, which can be plugged into popular two-stage association trackers. Experimental results utilizing RCM demonstrate the effectiveness of the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving in waterborne environments. The USVTrack dataset is public on https://usvtrack.github.io.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap, we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from 8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100 evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered evaluation in Generative 3D.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment. (The code is available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/zser092/Focused-Attention-ViT).

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene.

arXiv:2506.18798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP. These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host processing.

arXiv:2506.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation, improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories. Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3) prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding. Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in handling occlusions and novel viewpoints.

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for spatio-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach. Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions, dynamic scenes, and singing.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos, promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames, preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual smoothness.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture accurately.

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii) By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time? We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches, e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

<title>Vision as a Dialect: Unifying Visual Understanding and Generation via Text-Aligned Representations</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation. At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater training efficiency.

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However, existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional, audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles, FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

<title>Audit &amp; Repair: An Agentic Framework for Consistent Story Visualization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic, temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond vehicles.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation: foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet, VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results, validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations, short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies. MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology education.

<title>Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

<title>Can Common VLMs Rival Medical VLMs? Evaluation and Strategic Insights</title>

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources. Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering (VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the medical imaging field.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g., motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g., smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use. Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps. Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time, particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of the newly generated text and images.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR datasets to support autonomous vehicle perception, robotics research, and sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery. The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies. Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling, and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions, such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile, reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of animated cloud returns and image sensor data can be found at this Link.

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original (source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering, facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing tasks.

<title>General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting</title>

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.

<title>DSA-NRP: No-Reflow Prediction from Angiographic Perfusion Dynamics in Stroke EVT</title>

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes. Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure, delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI. No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC: 0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331 $\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

<title>EASE: Embodied Active Event Perception via Self-Supervised Energy Minimization</title>

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces, annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

<title>MTSIC: Multi-stage Transformer-based GAN for Spectral Infrared Image Colorization</title>

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging, are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze. However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC, progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible. In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed, considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views, and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained the best results.

<title>Can Generated Images Serve as a Viable Modality for Text-Centric Multimodal Learning?</title>

Abstract: A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent ``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm, providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in traditionally unimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will be available on GitHub.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies, porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over 19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74, FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA 0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling (Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science initiatives.

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering (STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics, this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related to the W-DRO problem.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods, binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration. Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining competitive inference speed.

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However, existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean boundaries for part decomposition.

Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500 annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally, the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results. Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses: Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection. Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.

<title>Multimodal Medical Image Binding via Shared Text Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically, based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text, M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention, due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited practical value.

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models, GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

<title>Morse: Dual-Sampling for Lossless Acceleration of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis. The code and models are available at https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse.

Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, a routine histopathological procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to generate highfidelity IHC images from H&amp;E-stained tissue samples, enabling cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional HER2 diagnostics.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in cross-modal semantic understanding between visual and textual modalities. Given the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations. Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to facilitate further research, available at https://github.com/haonenglin/Awesome-VLM-for-MIA. It is anticipated that this article can help researchers who are interested in harnessing VLMs in medical image analysis tasks have a better understanding on their capabilities and limitations, as well as current technical barriers, to promote their innovative, robust, and safe application in clinical practice.

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space. Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap. However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically, we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wyysteelhead/TFevolve.

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code, illustrative video and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZzhYgwh/TwistEstimator.

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness. In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE images, confirming its generalization ability.

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations. These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap, training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap, inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges, e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution, producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels. Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution. Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated, or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the baselines by up to approximately 14%.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at 10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data. To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale, we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images. Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments. Our code and dataset are available online at this link: https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/TFR24 BorealHDR

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

Abstract: Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), it has become a common practice to train models on synthetic data due to data-scarcity and privacy leakage problems. Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all the visual relation triplets <sub> in a given image. With the emergence of various advanced techniques for better utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic information in each relation triplet, SGG has achieved great progress over the recent years. However, due to the ubiquitous long-tailed predicate distributions, today's SGG models are still easily biased to the head predicates. Currently, the most prevalent debiasing solutions for SGG are re-balancing methods, e.g., changing the distributions of original training samples. In this paper, we argue that all existing re-balancing strategies fail to increase the diversity of the relation triplet features of each predicate, which is critical for robust SGG. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-level Compositional Feature Augmentation (MCFA) strategy, which aims to mitigate the bias issue from the perspective of increasing the diversity of triplet features. Specifically, we enhance relationship diversity on not only feature-level, i.e., replacing the intrinsic or extrinsic visual features of triplets with other correlated samples to create novel feature compositions for tail predicates, but also image-level, i.e., manipulating the image to generate brand new visual appearance for triplets. Due to its model-agnostic nature, MCFA can be seamlessly incorporated into various SGG frameworks. Extensive ablations have shown that MCFA achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the trade-off between different metrics.

Abstract: The area of temporally fine-grained video representation learning focuses on generating frame-by-frame representations for temporally dense tasks, such as fine-grained action phase classification and frame retrieval. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art for self-supervised models in this area by re-examining the design of transformer architectures for video representation learning. A key aspect of our approach is the improved sharing of scene information in the temporal pipeline by representing multiple salient entities per frame. Prior works use late-fusion architectures that reduce frames to a single-dimensional vector before modeling any cross-frame dynamics. In contrast, our Multi-entity Video Transformer (MV-Former) processes the frames as groups of entities represented as tokens linked across time. To achieve this, we propose a Learnable Spatial Token Pooling strategy to identify and extract features for multiple salient regions per frame. Through our experiments, we show that MV-Former outperforms previous self-supervised methods, and also surpasses some prior works that use additional supervision or training data. When combined with additional pre-training data from Kinetics-400, MV-Former achieves a further performance boost. Overall, our MV-Former achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple fine-grained video benchmarks and shows that parsing video scenes as collections of entities can enhance performance in video tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become mainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model has received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms. Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5\% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation tasks. However, the lengthy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising for compressing and accelerating diffusion models. Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic activations, existing PTQ methods suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose EDA-DM, a standardized PTQ method that efficiently addresses the above issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we extract information from the density and diversity of latent space feature maps, which guides the selection of calibration samples to align with the overall sample distribution; and at the reconstruction output level, we theoretically analyze the reasons for previous reconstruction failures and, based on this insight, optimize block reconstruction using the Hessian loss of layers, aligning the outputs of quantized model and full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM significantly outperforms the existing PTQ methods across various models and datasets. Our method achieves a 1.83 times speedup and 4 times compression for the popular Stable-Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.05 loss in CLIP score.

Abstract: Retinal fundus images play a crucial role in the early detection of eye diseases. However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss. The project's code is publicly available: https://github.com/berenslab/disentangling-retinal-images.

Abstract: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic aid and medical research in radiology. However, current CBIR systems face limitations due to their specialization to certain pathologies, limiting their utility. On the other hand, several vision foundation models have been shown to produce general-purpose visual features. Therefore, in this work, we propose using vision foundation models as powerful and versatile off-the-shelf feature extractors for content-based image retrieval. Our contributions include: (1) benchmarking a diverse set of vision foundation models on an extensive dataset comprising 1.6 million 2D radiological images across four modalities and 161 pathologies; (2) identifying weakly-supervised models, particularly BiomedCLIP, as highly effective, achieving a achieving a P@1 of up to 0.594 (P@3: 0.590, P@5: 0.588, P@10: 0.583), comparable to specialized CBIR systems but without additional training; (3) conducting an in-depth analysis of the impact of index size on retrieval performance; (4) evaluating the quality of embedding spaces generated by different models; and (5) investigating specific challenges associated with retrieving anatomical versus pathological structures. Despite these challenges, our research underscores the vast potential of foundation models for CBIR in radiology, proposing a shift towards versatile, general-purpose medical image retrieval systems that do not require specific tuning. Our code, dataset splits and embeddings are publicly available under https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/foundation-models-for-cbmir.

Abstract: Exploiting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) models for open-vocabulary 3D semantic understanding of indoor scenes has emerged as an attractive research focus. Existing methods typically attach high-dimensional CLIP semantic embeddings to 3D Gaussians and leverage view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics as Gaussian supervision, resulting in efficiency bottlenecks and deficient 3D semantic consistency. To address these challenges, we present CLIP-GS, efficiently achieving a coherent semantic understanding of 3D indoor scenes via the proposed Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) and 3D Coherent Regularization (3DCR). SAC approach exploits the naturally unified semantics within objects to learn compact, yet effective, semantic Gaussian representations, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). 3DCR enforces semantic consistency in 2D and 3D domains: In 2D, 3DCR utilizes refined view-consistent semantic outcomes derived from 3DGS to establish cross-view coherence constraints; in 3D, 3DCR encourages features similar among 3D Gaussian primitives associated with the same object, leading to more precise and coherent segmentation results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably suppresses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving mIoU improvements of 21.20% and 13.05% on ScanNet and Replica datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, substantiating its robustness.

Abstract: The main problem in RGB-T tracking is the correct and optimal merging of the cross-modal features of visible and thermal images. Some previous methods either do not fully exploit the potential of RGB and TIR information for channel and spatial feature fusion or lack a direct interaction between the template and the search area, which limits the model's ability to fully utilize the original semantic information of both modalities. To address these limitations, we investigate how to achieve a direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features in RGB-T tracking and propose CSTNet. It uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and adds a Joint Spatial and Channel Fusion Module (JSCFM) and Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) integrated between the transformer blocks to facilitate cross-modal feature interaction. The JSCFM module achieves joint modeling of channel and multi-level spatial features. The SFM module includes a cross-attention-like architecture for cross modeling and joint learning of RGB and TIR features. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To enhance practicality, we retrain the model without JSCFM and SFM modules and use CSNet as the pretraining weight, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 50% speedup with an average decrease of 1-2% in SR and PR performance. CSTNet and CSTNet-small achieve real-time speeds of 21 fps and 33 fps on the Nvidia Jetson Xavier, meeting actual deployment requirements. Code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/CSTNet.

Abstract: Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques. However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.

Abstract: As one of the tasks in Image Fusion, Infrared and Visible Image Fusion aims to integrate complementary information captured by sensors of different modalities into a single image. The Selective State Space Model (SSSM), known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies, has demonstrated its potential in the field of computer vision. However, in image fusion, current methods underestimate the potential of SSSM in capturing the global spatial information of both modalities. This limitation prevents the simultaneous consideration of the global spatial information from both modalities during interaction, leading to a lack of comprehensive perception of salient targets. Consequently, the fusion results tend to bias towards one modality instead of adaptively preserving salient targets. To address this issue, we propose the Saliency-aware Selective State Space Fusion Model (S4Fusion). In our S4Fusion, the designed Cross-Modal Spatial Awareness Module (CMSA) can simultaneously focus on global spatial information from both modalities while facilitating their interaction, thereby comprehensively capturing complementary information. Additionally, S4Fusion leverages a pre-trained network to perceive uncertainty in the fused images. By minimizing this uncertainty, S4Fusion adaptively highlights salient targets from both images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality images and enhances performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Since rainy weather always degrades image quality and poses significant challenges to most computer vision-based intelligent systems, image de-raining has been a hot research topic. Fortunately, in a rainy light field (LF) image, background obscured by rain streaks in one sub-view may be visible in the other sub-views, and implicit depth information and recorded 4D structural information may benefit rain streak detection and removal. However, existing LF image rain removal methods either do not fully exploit the global correlations of 4D LF data or only utilize partial sub-views, resulting in sub-optimal rain removal performance and no-equally good quality for all de-rained sub-views. In this paper, we propose an efficient network, called MDeRainNet, for rain streak removal from LF images. The proposed network adopts a multi-scale encoder-decoder architecture, which directly works on Macro-pixel images (MPIs) to improve the rain removal performance. To fully model the global correlation between the spatial and the angular information, we propose an Extended Spatial-Angular Interaction (ESAI) module to merge them, in which a simple and effective Transformer-based Spatial-Angular Interaction Attention (SAIA) block is also proposed for modeling long-range geometric correlations and making full use of the angular information. Furthermore, to improve the generalization performance of our network on real-world rainy scenes, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for our MDeRainNet, which utilizes multi-level KL loss to bridge the domain gap between features of synthetic and real-world rain streaks and introduces colored-residue image guided contrastive regularization to reconstruct rain-free images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world LFIs demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Object detection has greatly improved over the past decade thanks to advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets. However, detecting objects reflected in surfaces remains an underexplored area. Reflective surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, appearing in homes, offices, public spaces, and natural environments. Accurate detection and interpretation of reflected objects are essential for various applications. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a extensive benchmark specifically designed for Reflected Object Detection. Our Reflected Object Detection Dataset (RODD) features a diverse collection of images showcasing reflected objects in various contexts, providing standard annotations for both real and reflected objects. This distinguishes it from traditional object detection benchmarks. RODD encompasses 10 categories and includes 21,059 images of real and reflected objects across different backgrounds, complete with standard bounding box annotations and the classification of objects as real or reflected. Additionally, we present baseline results by adapting five state-of-the-art object detection models to address this challenging task. Experimental results underscore the limitations of existing methods when applied to reflected object detection, highlighting the need for specialized approaches. By releasing RODD, we aim to support and advance future research on detecting reflected objects. Dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/jirouvan/ROD.

Abstract: Accurate real-time object detection is vital across numerous industrial applications, from safety monitoring to quality control. Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/chen-xin-94/DART.

Abstract: Large foundation models, known for their strong zero-shot generalization capabilities, can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, developing foundation models for medical image segmentation poses a significant challenge due to the domain gap between natural and medical images. While fine-tuning techniques based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have been explored, they primarily focus on scaling up data or refining inference strategies without incorporating domain-specific architectural designs, limiting their zero-shot performance. To optimize segmentation performance under standard inference settings and provide a strong baseline for future research, we introduce SyncSAM, which employs a synchronized dual-branch encoder that integrates convolution and Transformer features in a synchronized manner to enhance medical image encoding, and a multi-scale dual-branch decoder to preserve image details. SyncSAM is trained on two of the largest medical image segmentation datasets, SA-Med2D-20M and IMed-361M, resulting in a series of pre-trained models for universal medical image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SyncSAM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on test sets but also exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen datasets. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SyncSAM.

Abstract: Medical image classification plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making, yet most models are constrained to a fixed set of predefined classes, limiting their adaptability to new conditions. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers, such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles, directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions.To support further research, we use public datasets and provide our codebase and preprocessing pipeline under https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/VPE-in-Radiology, serving as a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.

<title>Leveraging Model Guidance to Extract Training Data from Personalized Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases. The code is available https://github.com/Nicholas0228/FineXtract.

<title>UniDrive: Towards Universal Driving Perception Across Camera Configurations</title>

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving has demonstrated excellent performance with economical sensors. As the fundamental step, 3D perception aims to infer 3D information from 2D images based on 3D-2D projection. This makes driving perception models susceptible to sensor configuration (e.g., camera intrinsics and extrinsics) variations. However, generalizing across camera configurations is important for deploying autonomous driving models on different car models. In this paper, we present UniDrive, a novel framework for vision-centric autonomous driving to achieve universal perception across camera configurations. We deploy a set of unified virtual cameras and propose a ground-aware projection method to effectively transform the original images into these unified virtual views. We further propose a virtual configuration optimization method by minimizing the expected projection error between original and virtual cameras. The proposed virtual camera projection can be applied to existing 3D perception methods as a plug-and-play module to mitigate the challenges posed by camera parameter variability, resulting in more adaptable and reliable driving perception models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a dataset on CARLA by driving the same routes while only modifying the camera configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method trained on one specific camera configuration can generalize to varying configurations with minor performance degradation.

<title>How Far is Video Generation from World Model: A Physical Law Perspective</title>

Abstract: OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

<title>Efficient Feature Aggregation and Scale-Aware Regression for Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention due to simplicity and low cost. Existing methods typically follow conventional 2D detection paradigms, first locating object centers and then predicting 3D attributes via neighboring features. However, these methods predominantly rely on progressive cross-scale feature aggregation and focus solely on local information, which may result in a lack of global awareness and the omission of small-scale objects. In addition, due to large variation in object scales across different scenes and depths, inaccurate receptive fields often lead to background noise and degraded feature representation. To address these issues, we introduces MonoASRH, a novel monocular 3D detection framework composed of Efficient Hybrid Feature Aggregation Module (EH-FAM) and Adaptive Scale-Aware 3D Regression Head (ASRH). Specifically, EH-FAM employs multi-head attention with a global receptive field to extract semantic features for small-scale objects and leverages lightweight convolutional modules to efficiently aggregate visual features across different scales. The ASRH encodes 2D bounding box dimensions and then fuses scale features with the semantic features aggregated by EH-FAM through a scale-semantic feature fusion module. The scale-semantic feature fusion module guides ASRH in learning dynamic receptive field offsets, incorporating scale priors into 3D position prediction for better scale-awareness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that MonoASRH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The classification of distracted drivers is pivotal for ensuring safe driving. Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in automatically predicting driver distraction, fatigue, and potential hazards. However, recent research has uncovered a significant loss of accuracy in these models when applied to samples acquired under conditions that differ from the training data. In this paper, we introduce a robust model designed to withstand changes in camera position within the vehicle. Our Driver Behavior Monitoring Network (DBMNet) relies on a lightweight backbone and integrates a disentanglement module to discard camera view information from features, coupled with contrastive learning to enhance the encoding of various driver actions. Experiments conducted using a leave-one-camera-out protocol on the daytime and nighttime subsets of the 100-Driver dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach. Cross-dataset and cross-camera experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely AUCDD-V1, EZZ2021 and SFD, demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed method. Overall DBMNet achieves an improvement of 7% in Top-1 accuracy compared to existing approaches. Moreover, a quantized version of the DBMNet and all considered methods has been deployed on a Coral Dev Board board. In this deployment scenario, DBMNet outperforms alternatives, achieving the lowest average error while maintaining a compact model size, low memory footprint, fast inference time, and minimal power consumption.

Abstract: While different variants of perceptual losses have been employed in super-resolution literature to synthesize more realistic, appealing, and detailed high-resolution images, most are convolutional neural networks-based, causing information loss during guidance and often relying on complicated architectures and training procedures. We propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based naive \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{G}ranular \textbf{H}igh-\textbf{F}requency (MGHF-n) perceptual loss trained on ImageNet to overcome these issues. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive framework (MGHF-c) with several constraints to preserve, prioritize, and regularize information across multiple perspectives: texture and style preservation, content preservation, regional detail preservation, and joint content-style regularization. Information is prioritized through adaptive entropy-based pruning and reweighting of INN features. We utilize Gram matrix loss for style preservation and mean-squared error loss for content preservation. Additionally, we propose content-style consistency through correlation loss to regulate unnecessary texture generation while preserving content information. Since small image regions may contain intricate details, we employ modulated PatchNCE in the INN features as a local information preservation objective. Extensive experiments on various super-resolution algorithms, including GAN- and diffusion-based methods, demonstrate that our MGHF framework significantly improves performance. After the review process, our code will be released in the public repository.

Abstract: Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.

Abstract: The generation of anchor-style product promotion videos presents promising opportunities in e-commerce, advertising, and consumer engagement. Despite advancements in pose-guided human video generation, creating product promotion videos remains challenging. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Extensive experiments show that our system improves object appearance preservation by 7.5\% and doubles the object localization accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. It also outperforms existing approaches in maintaining human motion consistency and high-quality video generation.

To better protect individuals, organizations, and societies from its malicious applications, we describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion using multi-modal semantic embeddings. Our method is robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches, including resolution and compression attacks. This method is evaluated against DeepAction, a custom-built, open-sourced dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage.

Abstract: Non-invasive temperature monitoring of individuals plays a crucial role in identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals. Temperature monitoring becomes particularly vital in settings characterized by close human proximity, often referred to as dense settings. However, existing research on non-invasive temperature estimation using thermal cameras has predominantly focused on sparse settings. Unfortunately, the risk of disease transmission is significantly higher in dense settings like movie theaters or classrooms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust temperature estimation methods tailored explicitly for dense settings.
  Our study proposes a non-invasive temperature estimation system that combines a thermal camera with an edge device. Our system employs YOLO models for face detection and utilizes a regression framework for temperature estimation. We evaluated the system on a diverse dataset collected in dense and sparse settings. Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of over 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the regression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square error of 0.18$^{\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our experiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness, positioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in real-world applications. With this paper, we release our dataset and programming code publicly.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain, and storage costs are substantial. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. %, our approach generates robust and invariant features across diverse and unknown modalities. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability. The code will be released at https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/MIFNet.

Abstract: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.

<title>Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs</title>

Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.10%, 50.98%, and 43.10% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

Abstract: This work introduces ILIAS, a new test dataset for Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale. It is designed to evaluate the ability of current and future foundation models and retrieval techniques to recognize particular objects. The key benefits over existing datasets include large scale, domain diversity, accurate ground truth, and a performance that is far from saturated. ILIAS includes query and positive images for 1,000 object instances, manually collected to capture challenging conditions and diverse domains. Large-scale retrieval is conducted against 100 million distractor images from YFCC100M. To avoid false negatives without extra annotation effort, we include only query objects confirmed to have emerged after 2014, i.e. the compilation date of YFCC100M. An extensive benchmarking is performed with the following observations: i) models fine-tuned on specific domains, such as landmarks or products, excel in that domain but fail on ILIAS ii) learning a linear adaptation layer using multi-domain class supervision results in performance improvements, especially for vision-language models iii) local descriptors in retrieval re-ranking are still a key ingredient, especially in the presence of severe background clutter iv) the text-to-image performance of the vision-language foundation models is surprisingly close to the corresponding image-to-image case. website: https://vrg.fel.cvut.cz/ilias/

Abstract: Building on recent advances in Bayesian statistics and image denoising, we propose Noise2Score3D, a fully unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising that addresses the critical challenge of limited availability of clean data. Noise2Score3D learns the gradient of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, our method performs inference in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thereby improving both performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming other unsupervised methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics, and rivaling some supervised approaches. Furthermore, Noise2Score3D demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Cloud, a criterion that allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters, which further enhances the method's versatility and real-world utility.

<title>Direct Discriminative Optimization: Your Likelihood-Based Visual Generative Model is Secretly a GAN Discriminator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01103</link>

Abstract: While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective, which minimizes the forward KL divergence, inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that integrates likelihood-based generative training and GAN-type discrimination to bypass this fundamental constraint by exploiting reverse KL and self-generated negative signals. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58/1.96 to new records of 1.30/0.97/1.26 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64/ImageNet 512x512 datasets without any guidance mechanisms, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256x256.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time object detection on resource-constrained hardware is critical for anomaly-behavior monitoring. We introduce HGO-YOLO, a lightweight detector that combines GhostHGNetv2 with an optimized parameter-sharing head (OptiConvDetect) to deliver an outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-off. By embedding GhostConv into the HGNetv2 backbone with multi-scale residual fusion, the receptive field is enlarged while redundant computation is reduced by 50%. OptiConvDetect shares a partial-convolution layer for the classification and regression branches, cutting detection-head FLOPs by 41% without accuracy loss. On three anomaly datasets (fall, fight, smoke), HGO-YOLO attains 87.4% mAP@0.5 and 81.1% recall at 56 FPS on a single CPU with just 4.3 GFLOPs and 4.6 MB-surpassing YOLOv8n by +3.0% mAP, -51.7% FLOPs, and 1.7* speed. Real-world tests on a Jetson Orin Nano further confirm a stable throughput gain of 42 FPS.

<title>HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model</title>

Abstract: A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.

<title>LAPIG: Language Guided Projector Image Generation with Surface Adaptation and Stylization</title>

Abstract: We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with surface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) rely on supervised training, requiring extensive manual annotations, and often produce errors due to the separation between layout and text processing. In contrast, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a general approach to recognizing diverse handwriting styles without the need for model-specific training. The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition. Comparisons with Transkribus show no consistent advantage for either approach. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate limited ability to autonomously correct errors in zero-shot transcriptions.

Abstract: The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.

Abstract: The development of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs) has shown significant promise in autonomous task execution. However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-Wise Multi-Dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling. The project is available at https://github.com/antgroup/Similar.

Abstract: Gating mechanisms have emerged as an effective strategy integrated into model designs beyond recurrent neural networks for addressing long-range dependency problems. In a broad understanding, it provides adaptive control over the information flow while maintaining computational efficiency. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis on how the gating mechanism works in neural networks. In this paper, inspired by the \textit{convolution theorem}, we systematically explore the effect of gating mechanisms on the training dynamics of neural networks from a frequency perspective. We investigate the interact between the element-wise product and activation functions in managing the responses to different frequency components. Leveraging these insights, we propose a Gating Mechanism Network (GmNet), a lightweight model designed to efficiently utilize the information of various frequency components. It minimizes the low-frequency bias present in existing lightweight models. GmNet achieves impressive performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in the image classification task.

Abstract: We propose a flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool (SALT) for general LiDAR point clouds with cross-scene adaptability and 4D consistency. Unlike recent approaches that rely on camera distillation, SALT operates directly on raw LiDAR data, automatically generating pre-segmentation results. To achieve this, we propose a novel zero-shot learning paradigm, termed data alignment, which transforms LiDAR data into pseudo-images by aligning with the training distribution of vision foundation models. Additionally, we design a 4D-consistent prompting strategy and 4D non-maximum suppression module to enhance SAM2, ensuring high-quality, temporally consistent presegmentation. SALT surpasses the latest zero-shot methods by 18.4% PQ on SemanticKITTI and achieves nearly 40-50% of human annotator performance on our newly collected low-resolution LiDAR data and on combined data from three LiDAR types, significantly boosting annotation efficiency. We anticipate that SALT's open-sourcing will catalyze substantial expansion of current LiDAR datasets and lay the groundwork for the future development of LiDAR foundation models. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/SALT.

Abstract: We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), the latest model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities (64.0 on MMMU, 46.3 on MMMU-Pro, 56.9 on MathVision, 80.1 on MathVista, 65.2 on VideoMMMU) while obtaining robust general abilities.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a severe eye condition caused by diabetes where the retinal blood vessels get damaged and can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated. Early and accurate detection is key to intervention and stopping the disease progressing. For addressing this disease properly, this paper presents a comprehensive approach for automated diabetic retinopathy detection by proposing a new hybrid deep learning model called VR-FuseNet. Diabetic retinopathy is a major eye disease and leading cause of blindness especially among diabetic patients so accurate and efficient automated detection methods are required. To address the limitations of existing methods including dataset imbalance, diversity and generalization issues this paper presents a hybrid dataset created from five publicly available diabetic retinopathy datasets. Essential preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for class balancing and CLAHE for image enhancement are applied systematically to the dataset to improve the robustness and generalizability of the dataset. The proposed VR-FuseNet model combines the strengths of two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, VGG19 which captures fine-grained spatial features and ResNet50V2 which is known for its deep hierarchical feature extraction. This fusion improves the diagnostic performance and achieves an accuracy of 91.824%. The model outperforms individual architectures on all performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid feature extraction in Diabetic Retinopathy classification tasks. To make the proposed model more clinically useful and interpretable this paper incorporates multiple XAI techniques. These techniques generate visual explanations that clearly indicate the retinal features affecting the model's prediction such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates so that clinicians can interpret and validate.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely used in image editing due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, achieving fine-grained control over specific object attributes, such as color and material, remains a considerable challenge. Existing methods often fail to accurately modify these attributes or compromise structural integrity and overall image consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Structure Preservation and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a novel training-free framework that enables precise generation of color and material attributes for the same object by intelligently manipulating self-attention maps and cross-attention values within diffusion models. Building on SPAA, we integrate multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to automate data curation and instruction generation. Leveraging this object attribute data collection engine, we construct the Attribute Dataset, encompassing a comprehensive range of colors and materials across diverse object categories. Using this generated dataset, we propose InstructAttribute, an instruction-tuned model that enables fine-grained and object-level attribute editing through natural language prompts. This capability holds significant practical implications for diverse fields, from accelerating product design and e-commerce visualization to enhancing virtual try-on experiences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructAttribute outperforms existing instruction-based baselines, achieving a superior balance between attribute modification accuracy and structural preservation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language. Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports. However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2 images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale, problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports, we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bhattarailab/Hallucination-Aware-VLM.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition, encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous' methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code is available at https://github.com/LIA-DiTella/VesselGPT-MICCAI.

<title>CGS-GAN: 3D Consistent Gaussian Splatting GANs for High Resolution Human Head Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation.

<title>Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19319</link>

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However, WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD, offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods to handle multi-modal distribution shifts.

Abstract: PhysicsNeRF is a physically grounded framework for 3D reconstruction from sparse views, extending Neural Radiance Fields with four complementary constraints: depth ranking, RegNeRF-style consistency, sparsity priors, and cross-view alignment. While standard NeRFs fail under sparse supervision, PhysicsNeRF employs a compact 0.67M-parameter architecture and achieves 21.4 dB average PSNR using only 8 views, outperforming prior methods. A generalization gap of 5.7-6.2 dB is consistently observed and analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations of sparse-view reconstruction. PhysicsNeRF enables physically consistent, generalizable 3D representations for agent interaction and simulation, and clarifies the expressiveness-generalization trade-off in constrained NeRF models.

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long, dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Subgraph isomorphism, also known as subgraph matching, is typically regarded as an NP-complete problem. This complexity is further compounded in practical applications where edge weights are real-valued and may be affected by measurement noise and potential missing data. Such graph matching routinely arises in applications such as image matching and map matching. Most subgraph matching methods fail to perform node-to-node matching under presence of such corruptions. We propose a method for identifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the inexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique topology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in the full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the matched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation is performed on the Erdos-Renyi random graphs and two case studies are performed on the image-based affine covariant features dataset and KITTI stereo dataset respectively. Going beyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown to have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random measurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily applicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality.

Abstract: Complex continuous or mixed joint distributions (e.g., P(Y | z_1, z_2, ..., z_N)) generally lack closed-form solutions, often necessitating approximations such as MCMC. This paper proposes Indeterminate Probability Theory (IPT), which makes the following contributions: (1) An observer-centered framework in which experimental outcomes are represented as distributions combining ground truth with observation error; (2) The introduction of three independence candidate axioms that enable a two-phase probabilistic inference framework; (3) The derivation of closed-form solutions for arbitrary complex joint distributions under this framework. Both the Indeterminate Probability Neural Network (IPNN) model and the non-neural multivariate time series forecasting application demonstrate IPT's effectiveness in modeling high-dimensional distributions, with successful validation up to 1000 dimensions. Importantly, IPT is consistent with classical probability theory and subsumes the frequentist equation in the limit of vanishing observation error.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is more ubiquitous in multiple domains. Smartphones, social media platforms, search engines, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of applications that utilize artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their performance. This study carries out a scoping review of the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning domain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were observed. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the technology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or otherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured, and the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating labeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or semi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The learning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions should be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in real-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to consider before mass adoption can occur.

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks such as CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks such as segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different downstream vision tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples in the self-supervised learning path and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. Moreover, Harmony optimizes for five different objectives simultaneously, efficiently utilizing the supervision in each data example, making it even more suited in data-constrained settings. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and outperforms the previously leading joint self- and weakly supervised methods, SLIP, MaskCLIP, and DetailCLIP.

Abstract: Resolving conflicts is critical for improving the reliability of multi-view classification. While prior work focuses on learning consistent and informative representations across views, it often assumes perfect alignment and equal importance of all views, an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios, as some views may express distinct information. To address this, we develop a computational trust-based discounting method that enhances the Evidential Multi-view framework by accounting for the instance-wise reliability of each view through a probability-sensitive trust mechanism. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets using Top-1 Accuracy, Fleiss' Kappa, and a new metric, Multi-View Agreement with Ground Truth, to assess prediction reliability. We also assess the effectiveness of uncertainty in indicating prediction correctness via AUROC. Additionally, we test the scalability of our method through end-to-end training on a large-scale dataset. The experimental results show that computational trust can effectively resolve conflicts, paving the way for more reliable multi-view classification models in real-world applications.

<title>Interpreting Global Perturbation Robustness of Image Models using Axiomatic Spectral Importance Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, e.g. mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as \textbf{I-ASIDE} (\textbf{I}mage \textbf{A}xiomatic \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{D}ecomposition \textbf{E}xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments over a variety of vision models pre-trained on ImageNet to show that \textbf{I-ASIDE} can not only \textbf{measure} the perturbation robustness but also \textbf{provide interpretations} of its mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.

<title>One-Step is Enough: Sparse Autoencoders for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) involves discovering shared concepts across images through analogy, akin to solving IQ test problems. Bongard Problems (BPs) remain a key challenge in AVR, requiring both visual reasoning and verbal description. We investigate whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can solve BPs by formulating a set of diverse MLLM-suited solution strategies and testing $4$ proprietary and $4$ open-access models on $3$ BP datasets featuring synthetic (classic BPs) and real-world (Bongard HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld) images. Despite some successes on real-world datasets, MLLMs struggle with synthetic BPs. To explore this gap, we introduce Bongard-RWR, a dataset representing synthetic BP concepts using real-world images. Our findings suggest that weak MLLM performance on classical BPs is not due to the domain specificity, but rather comes from their general AVR limitations. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/pavonism/bongard-rwr

<title>Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236</link>

Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.

<title>Systematic Reward Gap Optimization for Mitigating VLM Hallucinations</title>

Abstract: The success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in mitigating hallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) critically hinges on the true reward gaps within preference pairs. However, current methods, typically relying on ranking or rewriting strategies, often struggle to optimize these reward gaps in a systematic way during data curation. A core difficulty lies in precisely characterizing and strategically manipulating the overall reward gap configuration, that is, the deliberate design of how to shape these reward gaps within each preference pair across the data. To address this, we introduce Topic-level Preference Rewriting(TPR), a novel framework designed for the systematic optimization of reward gap configuration. Through selectively replacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled candidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over fine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data curation strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected responses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides the model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%. Notably, it significantly reduces hallucinations by up to 93% on ObjectHal-Bench, and also exhibits superior data efficiency towards robust and cost-effective VLM alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a crucial diagnostic challenge carrying immense clinical significance, for effective treatment regimens and patient management. For instance, a group of subjects termed SWEDD who are clinically diagnosed as PD, but show normal Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans, change their diagnosis as non-PD after few years of follow up, and in the meantime, they are treated with PD medications which do more harm than good. In this work, machine learning models are developed using features from SPECT images to detect early PD and SWEDD subjects from normal. These models were observed to perform with high accuracy. It is inferred from the study that these diagnostic models carry potential to help PD clinicians in the diagnostic process

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel structural holistic Atlas (holiAtlas) of the human brain anatomy based on multimodal and high-resolution MRI that covers several anatomical levels from the organ to the substructure level, using a new densely labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas was constructed by averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution were selected for this project. The images of these 75 subjects were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the proposed atlas has 350 different labels derived from 7 distinct delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at multiple scales, offering a coherent and consistent holistic representation of the brain across different levels of detail. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used to develop new ultra-high-resolution segmentation methods, potentially improving the early detection of neurological disorders. We make it publicly available to the scientific community.

<title>Directional Gradient Projection for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks in robotic manipulation present significant challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of designing dense reward functions and effectively exploring the expansive state-action space. However, despite a lack of dense rewards, these tasks often have a multi-stage structure, which can be leveraged to decompose the overall objective into manageable subgoals. In this work, we propose DEMO3, a framework that exploits this structure for efficient learning from visual inputs. Specifically, our approach incorporates multi-stage dense reward learning, a bi-phasic training scheme, and world model learning into a carefully designed demonstration-augmented RL framework that strongly mitigates the challenge of exploration in long-horizon tasks. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method improves data-efficiency by an average of 40% and by 70% on particularly difficult tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We validate this across 16 sparse-reward tasks spanning four domains, including challenging humanoid visual control tasks using as few as five demonstrations.

Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.

Abstract: Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from sentence-level text embeddings. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL-divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks. Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN.

Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Out-of-Distribution Detection, Prior Information, Information Geometry, Covariance Matrix, Dynamic Update

Summary:
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of AI systems. While prior methods using subspace-based techniques have shown effectiveness in detecting OOD data by extracting information geometry, they struggle to handle the influence of ill-distributed samples on data geometry. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed that dynamically adjusts the prior covariance matrix in response to real-time input features, thereby refining its information. By reducing covariance along the direction of input features and constraining adjustments to the residual space, the method preserves essential data characteristics while avoiding unintended effects on principal directions. Evaluation on pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and ImageNet-1k, including the DINO model, demonstrates significant improvements in OOD detection performance. The code for the proposed approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture. To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project Page: https://cjeen.github.io/LoraEditPaper

<div> Medical, anomaly detection, vision-language models, CLIP, zero-shot learning

Summary: 
The article introduces an innovative framework, IQE-CLIP, for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection tasks in the medical domain. Existing methods for anomaly detection often require prior knowledge of categories and specific prompts, limiting their effectiveness in distinguishing normal and abnormal instances. IQE-CLIP leverages query embeddings that combine textual and instance-aware visual information to better detect abnormalities. The framework incorporates class-based prompting tokens and learnable prompting tokens for better adaptation to medical data. Additionally, an instance-aware query module (IQM) extracts region-level contextual information from text prompts and visual features, enhancing the sensitivity to anomalies. Extensive experiments on six medical datasets show that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection tasks. The code and data are available at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/. <div>

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancements of vision-language models, such as CLIP, leads to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively capture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of distinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space. Moreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial scenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose an innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP. We reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and instance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities. Specifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable prompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we design an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual information from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation of query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments conducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We release our code and data at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/.

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers, effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be available at https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

Summary: 
Autonomous vehicles face challenges in navigating through crowded urban environments, necessitating accurate 3D scene mapping for obstacle detection. Current literature lacks a comprehensive approach to reconstructing object shapes with high boundary accuracy. The sign distance function, which calculates the distance from any point in space to the closest obstacle surface, is an efficient method for mapping obstacle shapes. This research introduces a learning-based methodology using LiDAR data and deep neural networks to generate static Signed Distance Function maps. Unlike traditional polygon representations, this approach offers more detailed boundary-level information for 3D obstacle shapes. The preliminary results show that this method improves collision detection performance, especially in congested and dynamic environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or 2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions, 3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF) maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic environments.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive dehazing framework designed to improve image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies fog intensity as light, medium, or heavy.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark, ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code available at: https://github.com/talha-alam/ADAM-Dehaze.

EchoShot is extended to support reference image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with unlimited shot counts.

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However, prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions. To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video modeling.

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures. We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO 2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

<div> Keywords: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), privacy-preserving framework, reinforcement learning, vision-language models, privacy protection

Summary:
This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving framework for protecting sensitive visual information captured by AI-equipped cameras in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional techniques like face blurring have limitations, as individuals can still be identified through other features. The proposed framework utilizes feedback-based reinforcement learning and vision-language models to convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, preserving scene-relevant information while enhancing privacy. A hierarchical RL strategy refines the generated text, improving both semantic accuracy and privacy protection. Evaluation results show significant enhancements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with an increase of approximately 77% in Unique Word Count and around 50% in Detail Density compared to existing methods. This approach addresses the critical privacy concerns associated with AI-equipped cameras in CAVs, offering a promising solution for safeguarding privacy in smart transportation systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text, enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

Summary: 
This study investigates how vision language models (VLMs) solve the 'binding problem' in visual scene processing by using symbol-like, content-independent indices to link features together. The research reveals that VLMs employ emergent symbolic mechanisms with a spatial indexing scheme to facilitate binding. Furthermore, the study identifies that errors in binding in VLMs stem from failures in these symbolic mechanisms. By shedding light on the symbol-like processing mechanisms in VLMs, the findings offer insights into addressing the persisting binding challenges faced by these models. <div>
arXiv:2506.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like, content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding. Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent binding failures exhibited by these models.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls. Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University (2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years) and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98 mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86 (controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and 0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 = 0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability. Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset, are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free pediatric pancreatic imaging and fostering collaborative research in this underserved domain.

Summary:
This paper presents a new framework for image and video demoir\'eing that combines Maximum A Posteriori estimation with advanced deep learning techniques. Traditional supervised learning methods struggle with nonlinear degradation processes, leading to incomplete moir\'e pattern removal or overly smooth results due to limited model capacity and training data. To address these issues, the proposed framework integrates a supervised learning model with linear attention Test-Time Training modules for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing. Additionally, a Truncated Flow Matching Prior refines outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution to restore high-frequency details and suppress artifacts. By combining the efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, this hybrid approach improves restoration performance for demoir\'eing tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes, which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT) modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing. The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration performance.

<div> VideoSync, video synchronization, multiple video streams, independent of specific feature extraction methods, datasets creation <br />
<br />Summary: Video synchronization, aligning multiple video streams capturing the same event from different angles, is essential for various applications. Prior methods relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting their applicability. The VideoSync framework introduced in this work operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, making it more widely applicable. The system is evaluated on newly composed datasets covering various scenarios, revealing biases in prior work. Corrections to these biases and a more rigorous evaluation framework show that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches. Different synchronization offset prediction methods are explored, with a CNN-based model identified as the most effective. These findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: ViTs, Mamba2, Polyline Path Masked Attention, structured mask, spatial adjacency modeling 

Summary: 
The paper introduces Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA), a novel architecture that combines the global dependency modeling of Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the spatial position modeling of Mamba2. PPMA enhances the structured mask of Mamba2 with a 2D polyline path scanning strategy, improving adjacency relationships among image tokens. The proposed polyline path mask is efficiently computed and embedded into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs to explicitly model spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments show that PPMA outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. For example, PPMA-T/S/B models achieve notable mIoU scores on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing state-of-the-art RMT-T/S/B models. The code for PPMA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

Summary:
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods typically struggle when dealing with entirely different modalities in source and target domains. This limitation is addressed by the proposed Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA) setting. The approach leverages a bridge domain with unlabeled samples from both modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. The Latent Space Bridging (LSB) framework, developed for semantic segmentation, incorporates a dual-branch architecture with feature consistency and domain alignment losses to align representations and reduce domain discrepancies.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities. To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task. Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.

Summary:
Mamba is a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan. LBmamba is introduced to eliminate the need for additional scans in Mamba-based computer vision methods by embedding a lightweight locally backward scan. LBVim is a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. LBVim consistently offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off compared to traditional methods. Experimental results show that under the same throughput, LBVim achieves higher accuracy on various datasets including ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. LBMamba is also integrated into a state-of-the-art pathology multiple instance learning approach, MambaMIL, and shows significant improvements in AUC, F1, and accuracy on public whole slide image classification datasets. <div>
arXiv:2506.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However, despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of performance.

<div> Keywords: Sign Language Video Generation, Fine-grained conditions, SignViP, Multi-Condition Token Translator, State-of-the-art performance

Summary: <br /><br />SignViP is a new framework for Sign Language Video Generation that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions to improve the fidelity of generated videos. It uses a discrete tokenization approach to represent fine-grained poses and 3D hands, enhancing the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos. SignViP consists of three core components: Sign Video Diffusion Model, Finite Scalar Quantization Autoencoder, and Multi-Condition Token Translator. These components work together to translate spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens, guiding the video generation process. Experimental results show that SignViP outperforms existing methods in terms of video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code for SignViP is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <div>
arXiv:2506.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model, which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity. Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions, SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3) Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity.

Summary: 

Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to potential navigation failures for robots. This paper investigates the impact of various adversarial attacks on VPR localization performance and proposes the integration of an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD) to enhance system reliability. The experiment paradigm demonstrates that adding AADs with detection accuracies as low as 75% can significantly reduce localization errors. Metrics such as Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, and Percentage of Time in an `Unsafe' State are evaluated to determine system effectiveness. The study also examines the efficacy of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack for VPR. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of AADs in ensuring trustworthy navigation in real-world applications and provide valuable insights for designing robust VPR systems. <br /><br />  <div>
arXiv:2506.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement -- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75% and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including: Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an `Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

<br /><br />Summary: 
The study introduces a novel training framework for self-supervised depth estimation in robotic endoscopy. By employing optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition, and transformation alignments in a multistep training process, the method addresses illumination variations and sparse textures in endoscopic scenes.

arXiv:2506.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work. In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps, including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with 4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published on https://github.com/BaymaxShao/EndoMUST.

<div> Keywords: visual generation, attention mechanisms, sparsification, quantization, Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)
Summary:
PAROAttention proposes a novel technique called Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO) to address the high memory and computational costs of attention mechanisms in visual generation. By reorganizing attention patterns into a hardware-friendly block-wise pattern, PARO simplifies and enhances sparsification and quantization, achieving nearly identical results to full-precision baselines with lower density and bitwidth. The methodology tailored for the unified pattern allows for lossless metrics in video and image generation, operating at approximately 20-30% density and INT8/INT4 bitwidth. PAROAttention achieves a significant end-to-end latency speedup of 1.9x to 2.7x compared to full-precision baselines. This approach offers an efficient solution for high-resolution image and multi-frame video generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)** technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**, achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to **2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of ``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing datasets and our proposed OpenBench.

Summary: STAR-Pose is a novel spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework designed for human pose estimation in low-resolution videos. It utilizes a spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention to capture long-range temporal dependencies efficiently. The method incorporates an adaptive fusion module with a parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. A pose-aware compound loss is employed to guide the network in reconstructing structural features beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than solely optimizing visual quality. Extensive experiments on various video human pose estimation datasets show that STAR-Pose outperforms existing methods. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution conditions (64x48) and offers faster inference speeds, ranging from 2.8x to 4.4x compared to cascaded approaches. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster inference than cascaded approaches.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces TD3Net, a novel backend architecture for word-level lipreading that combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions. This approach aims to address issues like blind spots in the receptive field and information loss in continuous lip movements. Experimental results on LRW and LRW-1000 datasets show that TD3Net achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters and operations. Visualization results indicate that the model effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while maintaining temporal continuity, demonstrating advantages in lipreading systems. The proposed TD3Net architecture covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots, showcasing its ability to capture complex temporal representations in lip movements. The code for TD3Net is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field, thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However, their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features. Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures. Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting notable advantages in lipreading systems.

<div> Keywords: dense video captioning, transformer-based architecture, PR-DETR, position prior, relation prior

Summary:
PR-DETR is a novel dense video captioning framework that incorporates explicit position and relation priors to improve localization accuracy and caption quality. It generates position-anchored queries to provide scene-specific information and uses an event relation encoder to calculate relationships between event boundaries. This approach enhances semantic coherence and eliminates implausible event proposals. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the position and relation priors. Experimental results on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of PR-DETR in terms of event localization and caption generation. The framework's innovative design and integration of position and relation priors set it apart from existing transformer-based methods, showcasing its potential for advancing dense video captioning research. 

<br /><br />Summary: PR-DETR introduces explicit position and relation priors into dense video captioning, enhancing localization accuracy and caption quality. By generating position-anchored queries and utilizing an event relation encoder, PR-DETR improves semantic coherence, eliminates implausible event proposals, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. <div>
arXiv:2506.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e., event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

This automatic selection process removes the need for manual prompt design, streamlining and improving the overall performance of LVLMs. AutoV establishes itself as a promising method for optimizing visual prompts in LVLMs, showcasing its potential for enhancing reasoning capabilities in machine learning models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks. For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU, highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

<div> Keywords: video generation, temporal consistency, FastInit, VNPNet, text-to-video models

Summary:
FastInit is a novel method introduced to improve video generation by enhancing temporal consistency without the need for iterative refinement. It achieves this through the use of a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that generates refined noise in a single forward pass, significantly increasing efficiency. A large-scale dataset is created to train the VNPNet, consisting of pairs of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video models demonstrate the consistent improvement in video quality and temporal consistency. FastInit not only offers substantial enhancements in video generation but also provides a practical solution that can be directly applied during inference. The code and dataset for FastInit will also be publicly released, allowing for further research and development in the field of video generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference. However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement. FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Summary: 
DeepObjectLog is a new neurosymbolic model that aims to learn object-centric representations from unstructured perceptual data without object-level supervision. It combines a perceptual module with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming to enable sound probabilistic logical inference. This approach allows the model to discover meaningful objects in the input and generalize across unseen object compositions, tasks, and numbers of objects. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepObjectLog outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines in various generalization settings. The integration of probabilistic logic programming in the symbolic component introduces a novel learning signal that guides the discovery of relevant objects and improves overall performance. <div>
arXiv:2506.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations, with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks, and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

<div> reinforcement learning, multimodal language models, SEED-Bench-R1, reasoning coherence, consistency-aware framework  
Summary:  
Reinforcement learning techniques have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models, but their adaptation to multimodal models is not well-studied. A new benchmark, SEED-Bench-R1, challenges models with complex real-world videos to evaluate generalization abilities. Standard GRPO methods improve answer accuracy but often sacrifice logical coherence, highlighting the need for a new approach. GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware framework, introduces a two-tiered reward system that prioritizes both answer correctness and logical consistency without explicit supervision. By amplifying rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and coherent, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on the benchmark, showing significant improvements in performance and consistency. This framework also demonstrates strong transferability across various video understanding benchmarks, contributing to the development of more interpretable and robust multimodal language models.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.

<div> Keywords: Referring Expression Segmentation, Adversarial Attack, Multimodal Bidirectional Attack, Textual Embedding, Cross-text Transferability

Summary:
Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) allows precise object segmentation based on natural language descriptions. The robustness of RES models against adversarial examples is a largely unexplored area. Existing attack methods fail to expose vulnerabilities in RES models due to their multimodal structure. In open-world scenarios, where users provide diverse referring expressions for the same image, there is a need for adversarial examples that generalize across varied textual inputs. To address these challenges, a novel adversarial attack strategy known as Multimodal Bidirectional Attack is proposed. This method involves learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and simultaneous visual-aligned optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the textual modality. The dual optimization framework enhances the cross-text transferability of adversarial examples, making them effective across a range of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of this method compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing methods.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel framework named GAP to address challenges in multi-task remote physiological measurement. The proposed framework combines multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) and test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) while considering individual biases and noise. By disentangling facial information into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise, the framework employs priors and observations in different modules to achieve generalization and personalization simultaneously. The approach was validated on six publicly available datasets and a new real-world driving dataset. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing the generalizability of metrics and facilitating real-time personalized adaptation. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the codes along with the new dataset will be made available for further research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile, given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring, while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization, our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new dataset will be released.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%, while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance systems into emergency management systems.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts. The project is available at GitHub.

<div> Keywords: Neural rendering, 3D Low-Level Vision, robust reconstruction, degradation removal, spatial consistency

Summary:
Neural rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have made strides in 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis. However, they struggle with degraded inputs like noise and low resolution. The field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) addresses these challenges by extending classical 2D tasks into the 3D domain. This survey, R^3eVision, delves into the robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement of 3D LLV, highlighting the importance of spatio-temporal consistency and optimization. It categorizes methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks to enable high-quality 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. The survey also explores application domains such as autonomous driving and AR/VR, emphasizing the need for reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs. By examining methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as crucial for generating robust 3D content in real-world settings.

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

<div> 1. Landslide monitoring, 2. Point cloud, 3. 3D displacement estimation, 4. Geohazards mitigation, 5. Hierarchical partition-based approach

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new hierarchical partition-based approach for landslide monitoring using 3D point clouds and RGB images. By combining geometric and radiometric information, the method estimates dense 3D displacement vector fields with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. The proposed method constructs patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refining them through geometric consistency checks and rigid transformation estimation. Experimental results on real-world landslide datasets show deviations in displacement magnitude below average scan resolutions and outperforming the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial coverage. The approach provides a practical solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and can be adapted to other point cloud monitoring tasks. The example data and source code are publicly available for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features. These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

<div> Keywords: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval, Dual-Vision Adaptation, Object-Perceptual Adaptation, In-Context Adaptation, Discrimination Perception Transfer

Summary:
Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach proposed for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval tackles challenges in learning discriminative visual representations through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Object-Perceptual Adaptation modifies input samples to highlight critical objects aiding in category prediction. In-Context Adaptation introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without altering pre-trained parameters. Discrimination Perception Transfer transfers discriminative knowledge to the image encoder using knowledge distillation mechanism. DVA balances retrieval efficiency and performance, outperforming current FGIR solutions on in-distribution and out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets. The approach has fewer learnable parameters and retains generalization ability, addressing overfitting while leveraging pre-training knowledge. DVA showcases promising results in fine-grained image retrieval tasks, offering a robust and efficient solution. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

<div> SyncMapV2, unsupervised segmentation, robustness, digital corruption, adaptability, self-organizing dynamical equations<br />
Summary:<br />
SyncMapV2 is a new AI algorithm that excels in unsupervised segmentation with remarkable robustness, outperforming existing methods. It demonstrates minimal drop in performance under various types of corruption such as noise, weather, and blur, without the need for robust training or supervision. Based on self-organizing dynamical equations and random network concepts, SyncMapV2 adapts online to input, unlike traditional methods that require re-initialization. Its adaptability tests show near-zero performance degradation, indicating potential for a new era of robust and adaptive intelligence. This algorithm represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, bridging the gap with human visual perception and paving the way for more resilient AI systems in the future. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

<div> Keywords: multi-scale architectures, image denoising, dual-domain network, spatial-frequency learning unit, feature fusion block 

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for image denoising, addressing limitations in existing architectures. MADNet utilizes image pyramid inputs and an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU) to separate high-frequency and low-frequency noise characteristics, enhancing denoising results. The network incorporates skip connections with a global feature fusion block to improve feature representation at different scales. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real noisy image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MADNet compared to current state-of-the-art denoising methods. <div>
arXiv:2506.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising approaches.

Summary:
DETA++ proposes a method for reliable Few-Shot Learning (FSL) by addressing the challenges posed by in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise in support and query samples. The approach utilizes a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate weights for support samples and introduces clean prototype and noise entropy maximization losses for noise-robust task adaptation. A memory bank is employed to refine clean regions for each inner-task class, enabling a Local Nearest Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) to provide robust predictions on query samples. Intra-class Region Swapping (IntraSwap) is used to correct ID class prototypes during task adaptation, improving the model's resilience to dual noises. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++ in addressing noise-related challenges in FSL tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping (IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation, enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Summary: <br />
Neural Networks are widely used in computer vision tasks such as Writer Identification and Writer Verification. This study introduces transparency techniques to enhance the understanding of neural network models trained for these tasks. By generating pixel-level saliency maps and point-specific saliency maps, the study aims to provide insights into the similarities between handwritten text images and the characteristics considered by the neural network during the identification process. Evaluation using deletion and insertion score metrics shows that pixel-wise saliency maps are more effective in supporting forensic experts. The qualitative comparison of map highlights with areas of interest identified by forensic experts further validates the usefulness of the transparency techniques in improving the performance and reliability of neural network models for WI and WV. <div>

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification (WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps, while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of forensic experts.

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel. Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET.

arXiv:2506.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training, maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of $\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework, facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception. Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts, highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation utilities.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture recognition.

<div> Keywords: pathology, whole slide image analysis, multiple instance learning, hyperbolic space, semantic hierarchy

Summary:
HyperPath is a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of whole slide images (WSIs) in hyperbolic space. It adapts visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language models to hyperbolic space and uses an Angular Modality Alignment Loss for cross-modal alignment. A Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships to enhance semantic coherence. Classification is performed with geodesic distance, eliminating the need for linear classifiers and enabling a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of HyperPath compared to existing methods, showcasing the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals. However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios, incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and adversarial transferability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations -- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74% accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Abstract: This paper presents the winning solution for the S23DR Challenge 2025, which involves predicting a house's 3D roof wireframe from a sparse point cloud and semantic segmentations. Our method operates directly in 3D, first identifying vertex candidates from the COLMAP point cloud using Gestalt segmentations. We then employ two PointNet-like models: one to refine and classify these candidates by analyzing local cubic patches, and a second to predict edges by processing the cylindrical regions connecting vertex pairs. This two-stage, 3D deep learning approach achieved a winning Hybrid Structure Score (HSS) of 0.43 on the private leaderboard.

Abstract: We investigate whether off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can tackle Online Episodic-Memory Video Question Answering (OEM-VQA) without additional training. Our pipeline converts a streaming egocentric video into a lightweight textual memory, only a few kilobytes per minute, via an MLLM descriptor module, and answers multiple-choice questions by querying this memory with an LLM reasoner module. On the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark, our best configuration attains 56.0% accuracy with 3.6 kB per minute storage, matching the performance of dedicated state-of-the-art systems while being 10**4/10**5 times more memory-efficient. Extensive ablations provides insights into the role of each component and design choice, and highlight directions of improvement for future research.

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames
  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

Abstract: In this report, we present Hunyuan3D 2.5, a robust suite of 3D diffusion models aimed at generating high-fidelity and detailed textured 3D assets. Hunyuan3D 2.5 follows two-stages pipeline of its previous version Hunyuan3D 2.0, while demonstrating substantial advancements in both shape and texture generation. In terms of shape generation, we introduce a new shape foundation model -- LATTICE, which is trained with scaled high-quality datasets, model-size, and compute. Our largest model reaches 10B parameters and generates sharp and detailed 3D shape with precise image-3D following while keeping mesh surface clean and smooth, significantly closing the gap between generated and handcrafted 3D shapes. In terms of texture generation, it is upgraded with phyiscal-based rendering (PBR) via a novel multi-view architecture extended from Hunyuan3D 2.0 Paint model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Hunyuan3D 2.5 significantly outperforms previous methods in both shape and end-to-end texture generation.

<title>How Hard Is Snow? A Paired Domain Adaptation Dataset for Clear and Snowy Weather: CADC+</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset (CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+ thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting as both noise and a distinct data domain.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

<title>SafeTriage: Facial Video De-identification for Privacy-Preserving Stroke Triage</title>

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians' ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients' identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions. However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently, ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs. boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

<title>MetaQAP -- A Meta-Learning Approach for Quality-Aware Pretraining in Image Quality Assessment</title>

arXiv:2506.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models. Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD, KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD, 0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721 to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of electronic devices in the modern era has led to a significant surge in electronic waste (e-waste). Improper disposal and insufficient recycling of e-waste pose serious environmental and health risks. This paper proposes an IoT-enabled system combined with a lightweight CNN-based classification pipeline to enhance the identification, categorization, and routing of e-waste materials. By integrating a camera system and a digital weighing scale, the framework automates the classification of electronic items based on visual and weight-based attributes. The system demonstrates how real-time detection of e-waste components such as circuit boards, sensors, and wires can facilitate smart recycling workflows and improve overall waste processing efficiency.

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge, which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP. Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner. Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm (e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8 times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance. Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant) can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of stereo systems.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden, severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half - establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

<title>Language-driven Description Generation and Common Sense Reasoning for Video Action Recognition</title>

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain. However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary information from both image modalities, producing more informative and comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>3DeepRep: 3D Deep Low-rank Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Inpainting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however, existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode, neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep) model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction (i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<title>Cross-modal Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion for Weakly Aligned UAV Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges: semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection. CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA), which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon, demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating 20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models, diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/WeinanGuan/NASA-Swin.

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes, leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020 benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

<title>RealSR-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Image Super-Resolution with Vision-Language Chain-of-Thought</title>

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.

<title>Seeing What Matters: Generalizable AI-generated Video Detection with Forensic-Oriented Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in 3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery patterns.

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence.

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration, and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation with targeted human supervision.

<title>Camera Calibration via Circular Patterns: A Comprehensive Framework with Measurement Uncertainty and Unbiased Projection Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16842</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance. To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity. The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at https://github.com/chaehyeonsong/discocal.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real and virtual characters.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems, particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes, human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of 0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/little-snail-f/ParkFormer.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS, is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

<title>LAION-C: An Out-of-Distribution Benchmark for Web-Scale Vision Models</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.

<title>Visual-Instructed Degradation Diffusion for All-in-One Image Restoration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16960</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.

<title>Reversing Flow for Image Restoration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code will be released soon.

<title>Prmpt2Adpt: Prompt-Based Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation for Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

arXiv:2506.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones, where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as the prediction range expands.

<title>Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17027</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

<title>Stretching Beyond the Obvious: A Gradient-Free Framework to Unveil the Hidden Landscape of Visual Invariance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders, we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following, we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT, an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data. First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for interactive and compositional design.

<title>Acquiring and Accumulating Knowledge from Diverse Datasets for Multi-label Driving Scene Classification</title>

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced, comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at https://github.com/KELISBU/KAA-CAL .

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.
  The source code for our implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/GreatenAnoymous/RGBTrack.git.

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors (APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information, while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

<title>On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting</title>

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

<title>Do We Need Large VLMs for Spotting Soccer Actions?</title>

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg-Plus.

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that can analyze images and extract locations and class labels for occurrences of objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object detectors.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression. Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a random forest classifier.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge. In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation: understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference. This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization. Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures, and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods. In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints, including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains. However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https: //github.com/yunhak0/Spotscape.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries. Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images, thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients, yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover, it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1 reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over 1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base, immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history. Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P. infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P. sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P. infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease detection and control in the field.

<title>The Safety Reminder: A Soft Prompt to Reactivate Delayed Safety Awareness in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature, allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed ``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility, offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance. Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures. Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator (FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline, wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal. In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization. Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method, highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2) to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across three large datasets.

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization. We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and computationally-wise.

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.

<title>Cross-Modality Learning for Predicting IHC Biomarkers from H&amp;E-Stained Whole-Slide Images</title>

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&amp;E whole-slide images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular features. The framework integrates paired H&amp;E and IHC embeddings through a contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI: 0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV. In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices' native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the project website at: https://zihuatanejoyu.github.io/HetNet/

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach: 1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off. Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the teledermatology process.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required. Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule, which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally, FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference speed.

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR) framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision. Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement), undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such, segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points. Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings, we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface, aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our source codes will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

Abstract: GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The source code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/februarysea/TrajSceneLLM.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will be released for future research.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin, branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes. Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth, tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical settings.

<title>Reimagination with Test-time Observation Interventions: Distractor-Robust World Model Predictions for Visual Model Predictive Control</title>

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training. Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable. Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification, where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors, significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model predictions without imagination interventions.

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space, capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality of generative codecs. The code will be available at https://github.com/Freemasti/DiffO.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE), and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources. Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting and fine-tuning large-scale models designed for natural image analysis often leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis, particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing overfitting.

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.

<title>A Prior-Guided Joint Diffusion Model in Projection Domain for PET Tracer Conversion</title>

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers. 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast, 6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process. Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency. In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO), a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced, alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse, often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding names like Frankfort or Devon.

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework, with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers, the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns, thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice, their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner, hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards better mitigating data biases with generative models.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

Abstract: Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at https://jianglongye.com/dex1b

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.

Abstract: We present a novel dataset covering seasonal and challenging perceptual conditions for autonomous driving. Among others, it enables research on visual odometry, global place recognition, and map-based re-localization tracking. The data was collected in different scenarios and under a wide variety of weather conditions and illuminations, including day and night. This resulted in more than 350 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from multi-level parking garage over urban (including tunnels) to countryside and highway. We provide globally consistent reference poses with up-to centimeter accuracy obtained from the fusion of direct stereo visual-inertial odometry with RTK-GNSS.

Abstract: Vision transformers have gained popularity recently, leading to the development of new vision backbones with improved features and consistent performance gains. However, these advancements are not solely attributable to novel feature transformation designs; certain benefits also arise from advanced network-level and block-level architectures. This paper aims to identify the real gains of popular convolution and attention operators through a detailed study. We find that the key difference among these feature transformation modules, such as attention or convolution, lies in their spatial feature aggregation approach, known as the "spatial token mixer" (STM). To facilitate an impartial comparison, we introduce a unified architecture to neutralize the impact of divergent network-level and block-level designs. Subsequently, various STMs are integrated into this unified framework for comprehensive comparative analysis. Our experiments on various tasks and an analysis of inductive bias show a significant performance boost due to advanced network-level and block-level designs, but performance differences persist among different STMs. Our detailed analysis also reveals various findings about different STMs, including effective receptive fields, invariance, and adversarial robustness tests.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel visual SLAM and long-term localization benchmark for autonomous driving in challenging conditions based on the large-scale 4Seasons dataset. The proposed benchmark provides drastic appearance variations caused by seasonal changes and diverse weather and illumination conditions. While significant progress has been made in advancing visual SLAM on small-scale datasets with similar conditions, there is still a lack of unified benchmarks representative of real-world scenarios for autonomous driving. We introduce a new unified benchmark for jointly evaluating visual odometry, global place recognition, and map-based visual localization performance which is crucial to successfully enable autonomous driving in any condition. The data has been collected for more than one year, resulting in more than 300 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from a multi-level parking garage to urban (including tunnels) to countryside and highway. We provide globally consistent reference poses with up to centimeter-level accuracy obtained from the fusion of direct stereo-inertial odometry with RTK GNSS. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art visual odometry and visual localization baseline approaches on the benchmark and analyze their properties. The experimental results provide new insights into current approaches and show promising potential for future research. Our benchmark and evaluation protocols will be available at https://go.vision.in.tum.de/4seasons.

<title>Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Segmentation via Conservative Propagation of Scene-level Labels</title>

Abstract: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation method for point clouds that predicts "per-point" labels from just "whole-scene" annotations. The key challenge here is the discrepancy between the target of dense per-point semantic prediction and training losses derived from only scene-level labels. To address this, in addition to the typical weakly-supervised setup that supervises all points with the scene label, we propose to conservatively propagate the scene-level labels to points selectively. Specifically, we over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering in the entire dataset and form primitives. We then associate scene-level labels with primitives through bipartite matching. Then, we allow labels to pass through this primitive-label relationship, while further encouraging features to form narrow clusters around the primitives. Importantly, through bipartite matching, this additional pathway through which labels flow, only propagates scene labels to the most relevant points, reducing the potential negative impact caused by the global approach that existing methods take. We evaluate our method on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, outperforming the state of the art by a large margin.

<title>Efficient Event-Based Object Detection: A Hybrid Neural Network with Spatial and Temporal Attention</title>

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation in omnidirectional videos are challenging due to the wide field-of-view and large spherical distortion brought by 360{\deg} images. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media platforms and retouching tools, more people are beautifying their facial photos, posing challenges for fields requiring photo authenticity. To address this issue, some work has proposed makeup removal methods, but they cannot revert images involving geometric deformations caused by retouching. To tackle the problem of facial retouching reversion, we propose a framework, dubbed Re-Face, which consists of three components: a facial retouching detector, an image reversion model named FaceR, and a color correction module called Hierarchical Adaptive Instance Normalization (H-AdaIN). FaceR can utilize labels generated by the facial retouching detector as guidance to revert the retouched facial images. Then, color correction is performed using H-AdaIN to address the issue of color shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and each module.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new gradient-based XAI method called Guided AbsoluteGrad for saliency map explanations. We utilize both positive and negative gradient magnitudes and employ gradient variance to distinguish the important areas for noise deduction. We also introduce a novel evaluation metric named ReCover And Predict (RCAP), which considers the Localization and Visual Noise Level objectives of the explanations. We propose two propositions for these two objectives and prove the necessity of evaluating them. We evaluate Guided AbsoluteGrad with seven gradient-based XAI methods using the RCAP metric and other SOTA metrics in three case studies: (1) ImageNet dataset with ResNet50 model; (2) International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset with EfficientNet model; (3) the Places365 dataset with DenseNet161 model. Our method surpasses other gradient-based approaches, showcasing the quality of enhanced saliency map explanations through gradient magnitude.

<title>Non-Uniform Spatial Alignment Errors in sUAS Imagery From Wide-Area Disasters</title>

Abstract: This work presents the first quantitative study of alignment errors between small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) georectified imagery and a priori building polygons and finds that alignment errors are non-uniform and irregular, which negatively impacts field robotics systems and human-robot interfaces that rely on geospatial information. There are no efforts that have considered the alignment of a priori spatial data with georectified sUAS imagery, possibly because straight-forward linear transformations often remedy any misalignment in satellite imagery. However, an attempt to develop machine learning models for an sUAS field robotics system for disaster response from nine wide-area disasters using the CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset uncovered serious translational alignment errors. The analysis considered 21,608 building polygons in 51 orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), and 7,880 adjustment annotations, averaging 75.36 pixels and an average intersection over union of 0.65. Further analysis found no uniformity among the angle and distance metrics of the building polygon alignments, presenting an average circular variance of 0.28 and an average distance variance of 0.45 pixels2, making it impossible to use the linear transform used to align satellite imagery. The study's primary contribution is alerting field robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI) communities to the problem of spatial alignment and that a new method will be needed to automate and communicate the alignment of spatial data in sUAS georectified imagery. This paper also contributes a description of the updated CRASAR-U-DROIDs dataset of sUAS imagery, which contains building polygons and human-curated corrections to spatial misalignment for further research in field robotics and HRI.

<title>Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?</title>

Abstract: The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in implicit scene representation enable high-fidelity street view novel view synthesis. However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast test-time optimization.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant attention, but their high computing cost limits the practical applications. While post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and speeds up inference, it often degrades performance, especially in low-bit settings. We identify two key reasons for the performance degradation: 1) existing quantization methods fail to align with the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations, and 2) reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations leads to a performance drop due to the significant influence of outliers in the scaling factors. To address these challenges, we propose DopQ-ViT, a Distribution-friendly and Outlier-aware Post-training Quantization method for ViTs. First, DopQ-ViT introduces the Tan Quantizer (TanQ), which better preserves the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations by focusing more on values near 1. Second, DopQ-ViT presents the MAD-guided Optimal Scaling Factor (MOSF), which selects the optimal scaling factor without introducing additional calculations. Extensive experiments across various ViT models and quantization settings demonstrate that DopQ-ViT, with the help of TanQ and MOSF, outperforms previous PTQ methods on both classification and detection tasks.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuting20/MaPPER.

Abstract: Large-scale datasets have been pivotal to the advancements of deep learning models in recent years, but training on such large datasets invariably incurs substantial storage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, real-world datasets often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically, our framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize the selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets. Notably, our method effectively removes noisy or damaged samples from the dataset, enabling it to achieve even higher performance with less data. This indicates that it is not only a way to accelerate training but can also improve overall data quality.

Abstract: Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors. As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task. This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively. By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks. A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks. We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released.

Abstract: Large numbers of synthesized videos from diffusion models pose threats to information security and authenticity, leading to an increasing demand for generated content detection. However, existing video-level detection algorithms primarily focus on detecting facial forgeries and often fail to identify diffusion-generated content with a diverse range of semantics. To advance the field of video forensics, we propose an innovative algorithm named Multi-Modal Detection(MM-Det) for detecting diffusion-generated videos. MM-Det utilizes the profound perceptual and comprehensive abilities of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) by generating a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) from LMM's multi-modal space, enhancing its ability to detect unseen forgery content. Besides, MM-Det leverages an In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism for feature augmentation in the spatio-temporal domain. A dynamic fusion strategy helps refine forgery representations for the fusion. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive diffusion video dataset, called Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF), across a wide range of forgery videos. MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance in DVF, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. Both source code and DVF are available at https://github.com/SparkleXFantasy/MM-Det.

<title>Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator: Towards Reliable and Fine-Grained Image Interpretation for Automated Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

Abstract: The cost of deploying vision transformers increasingly represents a barrier to wider industrial adoption. Existing compression techniques require additional end-to-end fine-tuning or incur a significant drawback to runtime, making them ill-suited for online (real-time) inference, where a prediction is made on any new input as it comes in. We introduce the $\textbf{Visual Word Tokenizer}$ (VWT), a training-free method for reducing energy costs while retaining performance and runtime. The VWT groups visual subwords (image patches) that are frequently used into visual words while infrequent ones remain intact. To do so, $\textit{intra}$-image or $\textit{inter}$-image statistics are leveraged to identify similar visual concepts for sequence compression. Experimentally, we demonstrate a reduction in wattage of up to 25% with only a 20% increase in runtime at most. Comparative approaches of 8-bit quantization and token merging achieve a lower or similar energy efficiency but exact a higher toll on runtime (up to 100% or more). Our results indicate that VWTs are well-suited for efficient online inference with a marginal compromise on performance.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

Abstract: Real-time free-view human rendering from sparse-view RGB inputs is a challenging task due to the sensor scarcity and the tight time budget. To ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space to learn rendering primitives. However, they either jointly learn geometry and appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body poses. To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in quantitative and qualitative experiments, which significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Current Visual Language Models (VLMs) show impressive image understanding but struggle with visual illusions, especially in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks focus on classical cognitive illusions, which have been learned by state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, revealing issues such as hallucinations and limited perceptual abilities. To address this gap, we introduce IllusionBench, a comprehensive visual illusion dataset that encompasses not only classic cognitive illusions but also real-world scene illusions. This dataset features 1,051 images, 5,548 question-answer pairs, and 1,051 golden text descriptions that address the presence, causes, and content of the illusions. We evaluate ten SOTA VLMs on this dataset using true-or-false, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. In addition to real-world illusions, we design trap illusions that resemble classical patterns but differ in reality, highlighting hallucination issues in SOTA models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 80.59% accuracy on true-or-false tasks and 76.75% on multiple-choice questions, but still lags behind human performance. In the semantic description task, GPT-4o's hallucinations on classical illusions result in low scores for trap illusions, even falling behind some open-source models. IllusionBench is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual illusions in VLMs to date.

Abstract: Designing structured visuals such as presentation slides is essential for communicative needs, necessitating both content creation and visual planning skills. In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation, where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL) instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310 slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are (i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and (ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud upsampling has been widely applied in tasks such as 3D reconstruction and object recognition. This study proposed a novel framework, ReLPU, which enhances upsampling performance by explicitly learning from both global and local structural features of point clouds. Specifically, we extracted global features from uniformly segmented inputs (Average Segments) and local features from patch-based inputs of the same point cloud. These two types of features were processed through parallel autoencoders, fused, and then fed into a shared decoder for upsampling. This dual-input design improved feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse and noisy regions. Our framework was applied to several state-of-the-art autoencoder-based networks and validated on standard datasets. Experimental results demonstrated consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and robustness. In addition, saliency maps confirmed that parallel global-local learning significantly enhanced the interpretability and performance of point cloud upsampling.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Raw Natural Image Noise Dataset (RawNIND), a diverse collection of paired raw images designed to support the development of denoising models that generalize across sensors, image development workflows, and styles. Two denoising methods are proposed: one operates directly on raw Bayer data, leveraging computational efficiency, while the other processes linear RGB images for improved generalization to different sensors, with both preserving flexibility for subsequent development. Both methods outperform traditional approaches which rely on developed images. Additionally, the integration of denoising and compression at the raw data level significantly enhances rate-distortion performance and computational efficiency. These findings suggest a paradigm shift toward raw data workflows for efficient and flexible image processing.

Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a foundational task in computer vision with many important applications. Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured.
  We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets.
  The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/jskvrna/MonoSOWA.

Abstract: The tradeoff between reconstruction quality and compute required for video super-resolution (VSR) remains a formidable challenge in its adoption for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While transformer-based VSR models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years, these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand, lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.

Abstract: We present ShapeLib, the first method that leverages the priors of LLMs to design libraries of programmatic 3D shape abstractions. Our system accepts two forms of design intent: text descriptions of functions to include in the library and a seed set of exemplar shapes. We discover abstractions that match this design intent with a guided LLM workflow that first proposes, and then validates, different ways of applying and implementing functions. We learn recognition networks that map shapes to programs with these newly discovered abstractions by training on data produced by LLM authored synthetic data generation procedures. Across modeling domains (split by shape category), we find that LLMs, when thoughtfully combined with geometric reasoning, can be guided to author a library of abstraction functions that generalize to shapes outside of the seed set. This framework addresses a long-standing shape analysis problem of how to discover reusable abstraction functions while exposing interpretable, semantically aligned interfaces. We find that ShapeLib provides distinct advantages over prior alternative abstraction discovery works in terms of generalization, usability, and maintaining plausibility under manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate that ShapeLib's abstraction functions unlock a number of downstream applications, combining LLM reasoning over shape programs with geometry processing to support shape editing and generation.

Abstract: Efficient long-video understanding~(LVU) remains a challenging task in computer vision. Current long-context vision-language models~(LVLMs) suffer from information loss due to compression and brute-force downsampling. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this issue, their applicability is limited due to explicit query dependency. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel memory-enhanced RAG-based approach called MemVid, which is inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings. Our approach operates in four basic steps: 1) memorizing holistic video information, 2) reasoning about the task's information needs based on memory, 3) retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and 4) focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities while achieving optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiments, MemVid demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to both LVLMs and RAG methods.

Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) aims to alter visual elements within an image to evoke specific emotional responses from viewers. However, existing AIM approaches rely on rigid \emph{one-to-one} mappings between emotions and visual cues, making them ill-suited for the inherently subjective and diverse ways in which humans perceive and express emotion.To address this, we introduce a novel task setting termed \emph{Diverse AIM (D-AIM)}, aiming to generate multiple visually distinct yet emotionally consistent image edits from a single source image and target emotion. We propose \emph{EmoAgent}, the first multi-agent framework tailored specifically for D-AIM. EmoAgent explicitly decomposes the manipulation process into three specialized phases executed by collaborative agents: a Planning Agent that generates diverse emotional editing strategies, an Editing Agent that precisely executes these strategies, and a Critic Agent that iteratively refines the results to ensure emotional accuracy. This collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many} emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally faithful edits.Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.

Abstract: In complex environments, detecting tiny infrared targets has always been challenging because of the low contrast and high noise levels inherent in infrared images. These factors often lead to the loss of crucial details during feature extraction. Moreover, existing detection methods have limitations in adequately integrating global and local information, which constrains the efficiency and accuracy of infrared small target detection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a network architecture named MSCA-Net, which integrates three key components: Multi-Scale Enhanced Dilated Attention mechanism (MSEDA), Positional Convolutional Block Attention Module (PCBAM), and Channel Aggregation Feature Fusion Block (CAB). Specifically, MSEDA employs a multi-scale feature fusion attention mechanism to adaptively aggregate information across different scales, enriching feature representation. PCBAM captures the correlation between global and local features through a correlation matrix-based strategy, enabling deep feature interaction. Moreover, CAB enhances the representation of critical features by assigning greater weights to them, integrating both low-level and high-level information, and thereby improving the models detection performance in complex backgrounds. The experimental results demonstrate that MSCA-Net achieves strong small target detection performance in complex backgrounds. Specifically, it attains mIoU scores of 78.43%, 94.56%, and 67.08% on the NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRTSD-1K datasets, respectively, underscoring its effectiveness and strong potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Advancements in computer-assisted surgical procedures heavily rely on accurate visual data interpretation from camera systems used during surgeries. Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with less than 100K images. To address these constraints, a new dataset called Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos totaling 938 hours of high-quality footage across multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection. Combining key components from ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across various benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80). Moreover, even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80. Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.

Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision, models still fall behind humans in generalizing to new input distributions. Existing benchmarks do not investigate the specific failure points of models by analyzing performance under many controlled conditions. Our study systematically dissects where and why models struggle with contour integration -- a hallmark of human vision -- by designing an experiment that tests object recognition under various levels of object fragmentation. Humans (n=50) perform at high accuracy, even with few object contours present. This is in contrast to models which exhibit substantially lower sensitivity to increasing object contours, with most of the over 1,000 models we tested barely performing above chance. Only at very large scales ($\sim5B$ training dataset size) do models begin to approach human performance. Importantly, humans exhibit an integration bias -- a preference towards recognizing objects made up of directional fragments over directionless fragments. We find that not only do models that share this property perform better at our task, but that this bias also increases with model training dataset size, and training models to exhibit contour integration leads to high shape bias. Taken together, our results suggest that contour integration is a hallmark of object vision that underlies object recognition performance, and may be a mechanism learned from data at scale.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image analysis often depend on large and diverse labeled datasets. Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models. https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models

Abstract: Video event detection is central to modern sports analytics, enabling automated understanding of key moments for performance evaluation, content creation, and tactical feedback. While deep learning has significantly advanced tasks like Temporal Action Localization (TAL), Action Spotting (AS), and Precise Event Spotting (PES), existing surveys often overlook the fine-grained temporal demands and domain-specific challenges posed by sports. This survey first provides a clear conceptual distinction between TAL, AS, and PES, then introduces a methods-based taxonomy covering recent deep learning approaches for AS and PES, including feature-based pipelines, end-to-end architectures, and multimodal strategies. We further review benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols, identifying critical limitations such as reliance on broadcast-quality footage and lenient multi-label metrics that hinder real-world deployment. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions toward more temporally precise, generalizable, and practical event spotting in sports video analysis.

Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments, and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development. Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and increased agricultural productivity.

Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks, including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions, offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting MRI scans can be complicated. This study tackles this challenge by conducting a comparative analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transfer Learning (TL) models such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2 for classifying brain diseases using MRI data from Bangladesh based dataset. ViT, known for their ability to capture global relationships in images, are particularly effective for medical imaging tasks. Transfer learning helps to mitigate data constraints by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, and Faster-ScoreCAM are employed to interpret model predictions. The results demonstrate that ViT surpasses transfer learning models, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.39%. The integration of XAI methods enhances model transparency, offering crucial insights to aid medical professionals in diagnosing brain diseases with greater precision.

<title>AnchorFormer: Differentiable Anchor Attention for Efficient Vision Transformer</title>

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches. Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiably learn these anchors and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. It avoids the burden caused by non-differentiable operations and further speeds up the approximate attention. Moreover, we extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 competition and share insights from the community. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CainanD/RefAV/ and https://argoverse.github.io/user-guide/tasks/scenario_mining.html

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex, spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model, enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1 achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli. CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving human-level accuracy.

Abstract: With the growing application of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become essential for tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts caused by environmental variations, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods hinder model generalization across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural settings. This paper investigates how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges by improving cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis. Given the limited availability of labeled data, weak model adaptability, and dynamic field conditions, DA has emerged as a promising solution. The review systematically summarizes recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, focusing on applications such as crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, where DA methods have enhanced performance across diverse domains. DA approaches are categorized into shallow and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised strategies, with particular attention to adversarial learning-based techniques that have demonstrated strong potential in complex scenarios. In addition, the paper reviews key public agricultural image datasets, evaluating their strengths and limitations in DA research. Overall, this work offers a comprehensive framework and critical insights to guide future research and development of domain adaptation in agricultural vision tasks.

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Abstract: Web-scale training on paired text-image data is becoming increasingly central to multimodal learning, but is challenged by the highly noisy nature of datasets in the wild. Standard data filtering approaches succeed in removing mismatched text-image pairs, but permit semantically related but highly abstract or subjective text. These approaches lack the fine-grained ability to isolate the most concrete samples that provide the strongest signal for learning in a noisy dataset. In this work, we propose a new metric, image caption concreteness, that evaluates caption text without an image reference to measure its concreteness and relevancy for use in multimodal learning. Our approach leverages strong foundation models for measuring visual-semantic information loss in multimodal representations. We demonstrate that this strongly correlates with human evaluation of concreteness in both single-word and sentence-level texts. Moreover, we show that curation using ICC complements existing approaches: It succeeds in selecting the highest quality samples from multimodal web-scale datasets to allow for efficient training in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is a challenging task with crucial implications for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced fully supervised medical image segmentation. However, this approach heavily relies on labor-intensive and time-consuming fully annotated ground-truth labels, particularly for 3D volumes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel probabilistic-aware weakly supervised learning pipeline, specifically designed for 3D medical imaging. Our pipeline integrates three innovative components: a Probability-based Pseudo Label Generation technique for synthesizing dense segmentation masks from sparse annotations, a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network for robust feature extraction within our Probabilistic Transformer Network, and a Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function to enhance training with annotation confidence. Demonstrating significant advances, our approach not only rivals the performance of fully supervised methods but also surpasses existing weakly supervised methods in CT and MRI datasets, achieving up to 18.1% improvement in Dice scores for certain organs. The code is available at https://github.com/runminjiang/PW4MedSeg.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence (EI) enables manufacturing systems to flexibly perceive, reason, adapt, and operate within dynamic shop floor environments. In smart manufacturing, a representative EI scenario is robotic visual inspection, where industrial robots must accurately inspect components on rapidly changing, heterogeneous production lines. This task requires both high inference accuracy especially for uncommon defects and low latency to match production speeds, despite evolving lighting, part geometries, and surface conditions. To meet these needs, we propose LAECIPS, a large vision model-assisted adaptive edge-cloud collaboration framework for IoT-based embodied intelligence systems. LAECIPS decouples large vision models in the cloud from lightweight models on the edge, enabling plug-and-play model adaptation and continual learning. Through a hard input mining-based inference strategy, LAECIPS routes complex and uncertain inspection cases to the cloud while handling routine tasks at the edge, achieving both high accuracy and low latency. Experiments conducted on a real-world robotic semantic segmentation system for visual inspection demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, processing latency, and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods. LAECIPS provides a practical and scalable foundation for embodied intelligence in smart manufacturing, especially in adaptive robotic inspection and quality control scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional cameras face a trade-off between low-light performance and high-speed imaging: longer exposure times to capture sufficient light results in motion blur, whereas shorter exposures result in Poisson-corrupted noisy images. While burst photography techniques help mitigate this tradeoff, conventional cameras are fundamentally limited in their sensor noise characteristics. Event cameras and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional cameras due to their desirable properties. SPADs are capable of single-photon sensitivity with microsecond temporal resolution, and event cameras can measure brightness changes up to 1 MHz with low bandwidth requirements. We show that these properties are complementary, and can help achieve low-light, high-speed image reconstruction with low bandwidth requirements. We introduce a sensor fusion framework to combine SPADs with event cameras to improves the reconstruction of high-speed, low-light scenes while reducing the high bandwidth cost associated with using every SPAD frame. Our evaluation, on both synthetic and real sensor data, demonstrates significant enhancements ( > 5 dB PSNR) in reconstructing low-light scenes at high temporal resolution (100 kHz) compared to conventional cameras. Event-SPAD fusion shows great promise for real-world applications, such as robotics or medical imaging.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over six datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.

Abstract: The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.

Abstract: Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) play a vital role in domains such as academia, finance, healthcare, and marketing, as they convey information through a combination of text, layout, and visual elements. Traditional approaches to extracting information from VRDs rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual annotation, making them labor-intensive and inefficient. Recent advances in deep learning have transformed this landscape by enabling multimodal models that integrate vision, language, and layout features through pretraining, significantly improving information extraction performance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based frameworks for VRD Content Understanding (VRD-CU). We categorize existing methods based on their modeling strategies and downstream tasks, and provide a comparative analysis of key components, including feature representation, fusion techniques, model architectures, and pretraining objectives. Additionally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss their suitability for different applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of current challenges and emerging trends, offering guidance for future research and practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive abilities over high-level perception and reasoning, their robustness in the wild remains limited, often falling short on tasks that are intuitive and effortless for humans. We examine the hypothesis that these deficiencies stem from the absence of core knowledge--rudimentary cognitive abilities innate to humans from early childhood. To explore the core knowledge representation in MLLMs, we introduce CoreCognition, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 12 core knowledge concepts grounded in developmental cognitive science. We evaluate 230 models with 11 different prompts, leading to a total of 2,530 data points for analysis. Our experiments uncover four key findings, collectively demonstrating core knowledge deficits in MLLMs: they consistently underperform and show reduced, or even absent, scalability on low-level abilities relative to high-level ones. Finally, we propose Concept Hacking, a novel controlled evaluation method that reveals MLLMs fail to progress toward genuine core knowledge understanding, but instead rely on shortcut learning as they scale.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making early diagnosis critical for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient prognosis. Computer-aided diagnosis systems, which analyze computed tomography images, have proven effective in detecting and classifying pulmonary nodules, significantly enhancing the detection rate of early-stage lung cancer. Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. The integration of ensemble models and novel techniques is also discussed, emphasizing the latest developments in lung cancer diagnosis. Deep learning algorithms, combined with various analytical techniques, have markedly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule analysis, surpassing traditional methods, particularly in nodule classification. Although challenges remain, continuous technological advancements are expected to further strengthen the role of deep learning in medical diagnostics, especially for early lung cancer detection and diagnosis.

<title>Layer-wise Alignment: Examining Safety Alignment Across Image Encoder Layers in Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have improved significantly in their capabilities, but their complex architecture makes their safety alignment challenging. In this paper, we reveal an uneven distribution of harmful information across the intermediate layers of the image encoder and show that skipping a certain set of layers and exiting early can increase the chance of the VLM generating harmful responses. We call it as "Image enCoder Early-exiT" based vulnerability (ICET). Our experiments across three VLMs: LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Llama 3.2, show that performing early exits from the image encoder significantly increases the likelihood of generating harmful outputs. To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective modification of the Clipped-Proximal Policy Optimization (Clip-PPO) algorithm for performing layer-wise multi-modal RLHF for VLMs. We term this as Layer-Wise PPO (L-PPO). We evaluate our L-PPO algorithm across three multimodal datasets and show that it consistently reduces the harmfulness caused by early exits.

Abstract: Shifts in data distribution can substantially harm the performance of clinical AI models and lead to misdiagnosis. Hence, various methods have been developed to detect the presence of such shifts at deployment time. However, the root causes of dataset shifts are diverse, and the choice of shift mitigation strategies is highly dependent on the precise type of shift encountered at test time. As such, detecting test-time dataset shift is not sufficient: precisely identifying which type of shift has occurred is critical. In this work, we propose the first unsupervised dataset shift identification framework for imaging datasets, effectively distinguishing between prevalence shift (caused by a change in the label distribution), covariate shift (caused by a change in input characteristics) and mixed shifts (simultaneous prevalence and covariate shifts). We discuss the importance of self-supervised encoders for detecting subtle covariate shifts and propose a novel shift detector leveraging both self-supervised encoders and task model outputs for improved shift detection. We show the effectiveness of the proposed shift identification framework across three different imaging modalities (chest radiography, digital mammography, and retinal fundus images) on five types of real-world dataset shifts using five large publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

Abstract: This work presents the IMPROVE dataset, a multimodal resource designed to evaluate the effects of mobile phone usage on learners during online education. It includes behavioral, biometric, physiological, and academic performance data collected from 120 learners divided into three groups with different levels of phone interaction, enabling the analysis of the impact of mobile phone usage and related phenomena such as nomophobia. A setup involving 16 synchronized sensors -- including EEG, eye tracking, video cameras, smartwatches, and keystroke dynamics -- was used to monitor learner activity during 30-minute sessions involving educational videos, document reading, and multiple-choice tests. Mobile phone usage events, including both controlled interventions and uncontrolled interactions, were labeled by supervisors and refined through a semi-supervised re-labeling process. Technical validation confirmed signal quality, and statistical analyses revealed biometric changes associated with phone usage. The dataset is publicly available for research through GitHub and Science Data Bank, with synchronized recordings from three platforms (edBB, edX, and LOGGE), provided in standard formats (.csv, .mp4, .wav, and .tsv), and accompanied by a detailed guide.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, long-tail scenario generation, and multimodal fusion to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.

Abstract: High-definition maps (HD maps) are detailed and informative maps capturing lane centerlines and road elements. Although very useful for autonomous driving, HD maps are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, access to these high-quality maps is usually limited to the firms that build them. On the other hand, standard definition (SD) maps provide road centerlines with an accuracy of a few meters. In this paper, we explore the possibility of enhancing SD maps by incorporating information from road manuals using LLMs. We develop SD++, an end-to-end pipeline to enhance SD maps with location-dependent road information obtained from a road manual. We suggest and compare several ways of using LLMs for such a task. Furthermore, we show the generalization ability of SD++ by showing results from both California and Japan.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most frequently ordered imaging test, supporting diverse clinical tasks from thoracic disease detection to postoperative monitoring. However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency. The project source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RPIDIAL/CheXFound.

<title>When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.09507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework for analyzing police body-worn camera (BWC) footage from the Rochester Police Department (RPD) using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical machine learning (ML) techniques. Our goal is to detect, classify, and analyze patterns of interaction between police officers and civilians to identify key behavioral dynamics, such as respect, disrespect, escalation, and de-escalation. We apply multimodal data analysis by integrating image, audio, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from BWC footage. The framework incorporates speaker separation, transcription, and large language models (LLMs) to produce structured, interpretable summaries of police-civilian encounters. We also employ a custom evaluation pipeline to assess transcription quality and behavior detection accuracy in high-stakes, real-world policing scenarios. Our methodology, computational techniques, and findings outline a practical approach for law enforcement review, training, and accountability processes while advancing the frontiers of knowledge discovery from complex police BWC data.

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.

Abstract: Advanced diagnostic instruments are crucial for the accurate detection and treatment of lung diseases, which affect millions of individuals globally. This study examines the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning models using a hybrid dataset, created by merging four individual datasets from Bangladesh and global sources. The hybrid dataset significantly enhances model accuracy and generalizability, particularly in detecting COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal lung conditions from chest X-ray images. A range of models, including CNN, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, were applied to both individual and hybrid datasets. The results showed superior performance on the hybrid dataset, with VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121 each achieving an accuracy of 99%. This consistent performance across the hybrid dataset highlights the robustness of these models in handling diverse data while maintaining high accuracy. To understand the models implicit behavior, explainable AI techniques were employed to illuminate their black-box nature. Specifically, LIME was used to enhance the interpretability of model predictions, especially in cases of misclassification, contributing to the development of reliable and interpretable AI-driven solutions for medical imaging.

<title>More Thinking, Less Seeing? Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

arXiv:2505.24305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D robotic manipulation have improved grasping of everyday objects, but transparent and specular materials remain challenging due to depth sensing limitations. While several 3D reconstruction and depth completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this, leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically, given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene. Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection. Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction effectiveness of SR3D.

arXiv:2506.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Summary: 
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS) aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while remaining robust across unseen domains, crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving. Vireo is introduced as a novel framework for OV-DGSS, leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. By incorporating GeoText Prompts, Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE), and Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), Vireo aligns geometric features with language cues, enhances gradient flow, and fuses structural and semantic features for robust predictions. Through comprehensive evaluation, Vireo achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, providing a scalable solution for visual understanding in diverse environments. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples. Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

<div> Keywords: ViLLa, animal monitoring, visual detection, language parser, symbolic reasoning <br />
Summary: <br />
ViLLa, a new framework called the Vision-Language-Logic Approach, has been developed for interpretable animal monitoring in natural environments. It combines a visual detection module for identifying animals, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logic-based inference. The system can accurately answer queries like "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?" by grounding visual detections into symbolic facts and applying predefined rules. ViLLa differs from black-box models by separating perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. It has been evaluated on various animal imagery tasks and successfully bridges visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries. <div>

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

Summary:
The article introduces the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving. It addresses key issues in existing methods by combining semantic and geometric graph Transformers. The Dual Gaussians Graph Attention dynamically constructs geometric and semantic graph structures to enhance feature aggregation and model semantic relationships. The Multi-scale Graph Attention optimizes boundary details and object-level topology through fine-grained and coarse-grained attention layers. Experimental results on the SurroundOcc dataset show significant improvements in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and memory usage compared to prior methods. The model achieves an mIoU of 24.10% while reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction. These advancements highlight the effectiveness of the GraphGSOcc model in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

Summary: 
DAVID-X introduces a dataset that pairs AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level annotations and written explanations, aiming to provide verifiable evidence for distinguishing synthetic content from authentic footage. DAVID-XR1, a video-language model, incorporates defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations to offer transparent and interpretable reasoning for its decisions. By transforming AI-generated video detection into a diagnostic process, the approach enables auditors and end-users to trust the identification of synthetic content.

arXiv:2506.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, chart-to-code generation, iterative refinement method, structured instruction, visual understanding

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional visual understanding capabilities but struggle with chart-to-code generation tasks. This new method, ChartIR, introduces an iterative refinement approach based on structured instructions to improve performance. By separating visual understanding and code translation tasks and providing structured instructions such as description and difference, ChartIR helps MLLMs accurately generate executable code from charts. The method divides the generation process into initial code generation and iterative refinement stages, enhancing the final output progressively. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods on both open-source and closed-source models. This approach holds promise for advancing chart-to-code generation tasks with MLLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces PictSure, an in-context learning (ICL) framework for few-shot image classification (FSIC) that focuses on the role of image embeddings. The study systematically evaluates different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies for embedding models. It is found that the success of training and out-of-domain performance in FSIC tasks heavily rely on how the embedding models are pretrained. By leveraging PictSure, the researchers were able to achieve superior results on out-of-domain benchmarks that significantly varied from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable performance on in-domain tasks. The code for PictSure is available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation. <div>
arXiv:2506.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

- BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers to optimize CNN architectures, suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

<div> deep learning, video annotation, retail, object detection, efficiency

Summary:
This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to automate key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos. Traditional manual labeling methods in retail applications are time-consuming and costly. The proposed method uses deep neural networks to extract features and incorporates object detection techniques tailored for the retail environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach achieves accuracy comparable to human annotators while increasing efficiency. By automating key-frame detection, the method leads to significant cost savings in video annotation tasks and reduces the need for manual verification or adjustment to less than 5% of frames. This automation proves valuable for various retail applications such as customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring. <div>

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

<div> Active view selection, 3D object reconstruction, neural uncertainty maps, UPNet, neural rendering<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach for active view selection in 3D object reconstruction using neural uncertainty maps predicted by a deep neural network called UPNet. By learning uncertainty patterns from natural objects, UPNet guides the selection of informative viewpoints for accurate reconstruction. The approach aggregates predicted uncertainty maps to reduce redundancy and select the most valuable viewpoint. Despite using fewer viewpoints, the method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy and significantly reduces computational overhead. It offers up to a 400 times speedup and over 50% reduction in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. The approach generalizes effectively to new object categories without needing additional training. <div>

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

Summary: 
Alignment in text-to-image (T2I) models is crucial for capturing user intent while ensuring safety and fairness. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, enhancing alignment through Hybrid Loss, Kernelized Representations, and Divergence Selection. A benchmark called DETONATE is introduced, focusing on social bias and discrimination axes of Race, Gender, and Disability. The Alignment Quality Index (AQI) is proposed to quantify latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations. Empirical results show that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly available.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, vision-language models, multimodal reasoning, positional reasoning, interleaved tasks

Summary: 
PeRL is a reinforcement learning approach designed to enhance vision-language models for multimodal reasoning tasks, specifically focusing on multi-image positional reasoning scenarios. It employs a multi-stage strategy to improve learning efficiency and task performance, including image sequence permutation for spatial diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling. The model outperforms R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines on both multi-image and single-image benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image tasks while maintaining comparable performance on single-image tasks. This demonstrates PeRL's effectiveness in generalizing to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, highlighting its potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities in vision-language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image generation, privacy risks, Membership Inference Attack (MIA), medical imaging

Summary: 
Diffusion models are commonly used for image generation, particularly in sensitive areas like medical imaging, which has raised concerns about privacy. One potential privacy risk is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), where an attacker tries to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, but applying them directly to medical images is challenging due to inherent image difficulty and high-frequency detail reconstruction issues. To address these challenges, the Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method is proposed for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. This method focuses on mid-frequency reconstruction errors, excluding high and low frequencies, to mitigate the influence of image difficulty. By analyzing the reverse diffusion process and computing the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images, membership can be determined. Experimental results on medical image datasets show that the FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Summary: 
ViT architectures and ViT-CNN hybrids were evaluated for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated CMS Open Data. Multi-channel jet-view images were constructed using detector-level energy deposits and reconstructed tracks. ViT models, especially ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, outperformed CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy. This indicates the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work lays the groundwork for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data and provides a structured dataset for further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

Summary:
The paper introduces two models, utilizing Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures, that use RGB tactile images and data from the GelSight sensor to accurately predict compliance metrics. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited in portability and scalability, making them unsuitable for robotic applications. These new models show significant improvement over existing neural network-based approaches in predicting compliance metrics. The study also examines the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, finding that estimating compliance for objects harder than the sensor is more challenging. This research contributes to the field of robotics by providing more accurate and effective methods for compliance estimation using vision-based tactile sensors. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

arXiv:2506.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching. The project is released at https://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.

StyleWallfacer introduces a unified training and inference framework that revolutionizes style transfer methods by addressing various issues and unifying different tasks. It incorporates a semantic-based style injection method using BLIP to generate text descriptions aligned with the style image semantics in CLIP space, creating a semantic gap for efficient style knowledge injection.

A training-free triple diffusion process manipulates self-attention layers for image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, maintaining text control and preserving original content.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Summary: 
The article addresses the issues of training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization methods used in autoregressive models. These issues are caused by a mismatch between the distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and data loss during compression. By utilizing the Wasserstein distance, the distributions are aligned, resulting in near 100% codebook utilization and reduced quantization error. The proposed approach effectively addresses these issues as validated through empirical and theoretical analyses. <div>
arXiv:2506.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The article introduces SynPo, a training-free few-shot method for medical image segmentation using Large Vision Models.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

PDSA utilizes correlations in high-dimensional space to correct feature distribution during aggregation, enhancing computational efficiency and robustness. It distinguishes point correlations based on a lightweight structural descriptor and increases class separability through long-distance modeling.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data. While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.

Summary:
ReSeDis introduces a new task that combines corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level object grounding. It aims to locate objects described by free-form text in images and provide accurate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Existing techniques either focus on tight object localization with unrealistic assumptions or excel at text-to-image retrieval without fine-grained localization. The benchmark curated for ReSeDis ensures unique matches between descriptions and object instances, eliminating unintended matches. A task-specific metric is designed to evaluate retrieval recall and localization precision. A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model demonstrates room for improvement. ReSeDis serves as a realistic testbed for developing robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) as a method to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage. It offers flexible coding options to produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options, preserving perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by vision-language pretrained (VLP) models.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

<div> Keywords: multimodal medical image fusion, diffusion model-based fusion network, UNet, feature recognition, hybrid loss function 

Summary: 
Multimodal medical image fusion is essential for accurate diagnosis, requiring a balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail. Existing methods often lack in capturing detailed features and cross-modal interaction, resulting in suboptimal fused image quality. To address this, a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) is proposed. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction, capturing detailed information and providing rich feature representations. In Stage II, noisy images are input into the fusion network, enhancing feature recognition. Fusion modules adaptively process images from different modalities. The network structure and hybrid loss function harmonize brightness, color, contrast, and detail in the fused image, improving its quality and information density. Experimental results show excellent performance across various medical image types. The code for DM-FNet is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Summary: 
Video-SALMONN 2 is introduced as an audio-visual large language model with low-rank adaptation for improved video captioning. The model utilizes directed preference optimisation (DPO) and introduces new metrics to evaluate completeness and accuracy of video descriptions.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

arXiv:2506.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Summary:
RA-NeRF is introduced as a novel method for accurate camera pose prediction in 3D reconstruction tasks, especially with complex camera trajectories. It utilizes NeRF for scene reconstruction with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation for enhanced robustness. The method also employs an implicit pose filter to capture camera movement patterns and remove noise for accurate pose estimation.

The approach demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in reconstructing scenes under challenging pose trajectories. <div>
arXiv:2506.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&amp;Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

<div> memory representation, camouflage object detection, historical context, visual information, RetroMem
<br />
RetroMem is a novel architecture for camouflaged object detection that integrates historical knowledge into the learning process. It consists of a learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter to capture visual information and a recall stage with a dynamic memory mechanism and inference pattern reconstruction. By incorporating relevant historical context, RetroMem enhances the model's understanding of camouflage scenes and outperforms existing methods on various datasets. This two-stage training paradigm provides foundational inferences during learning and reconstructs inference of camouflage patterns during recall, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. RetroMem's innovative approach to leveraging memory representations effectively address the limitations of traditional feedforward architectures, making it a promising advancement in the field of camouflage object detection.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation in video compression. The framework aims to address the limitations of existing Implicit Neural representations (INRs) in effectively representing detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. By enhancing temporal consistency using temporal windows and grouping video into multiple Groups of Pictures, the framework improves background representation. A multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function integrates multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. Additionally, a multi-scale feature block is introduced to fully leverage hidden features for improved feature extraction. Evaluation on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets shows that MSNeRV outperforms existing INR-based approaches and achieves better compression efficiency in dynamic scenarios compared to VTM-23.7 (Random Access). <div>

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, high-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in bird's-eye view (BEV) are essential for accurate localization, planning, and decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for semantic segmentation in the BEV representation.

<div> Keywords: Pathology image classification, Active Learning, Out-Of-Distribution data, Vision-Language Model, Diverse Informative ID Sampling

Summary: 
OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning approach for pathology image classification that leverages a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). Unlike traditional AL methods, OpenPath addresses the presence of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data in the unlabeled pool by incorporating task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts in the first query round. Subsequent queries utilize Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) techniques, such as Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS), to ensure the selection of In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experimental results on two public pathology image datasets demonstrate that OpenPath significantly enhances model performance by selecting high-purity, informative samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

<div> texture mapping, pelage patterns, re-identification, surface normal estimation, self-supervised training

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel geometry-aware texture mapping approach for improving animal re-identification in cases where fur or skin patterns undergo deformations. The proposed method unwarps pelage patterns, specific to animal skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enhancing feature matching accuracy. By utilizing surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process and maintaining geometric consistency between 3D surfaces and 2D textures, the method effectively addresses challenges posed by species with highly deformable fur patterns such as Saimaa ringed seals and leopards. Through integration with existing re-identification techniques, the framework demonstrates significant improvement in accuracy across various poses and viewing angles, without the need for ground truth UV annotations. Experiments conducted on seal and leopard datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing up to a 5.4% enhancement in re-identification accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

Summary: <br />
Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis (DDIS) is introduced to improve the quality of synthetic images generated without access to the original training data. DDIS leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, aligning generated images with the training data distribution. The method uses Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) to align the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during sampling. A single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding is optimized to capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experimental results on PACS and ImageNet show that DDIS outperforms existing Data-Free Image Synthesis methods, producing samples that more accurately reflect the learned data distribution and achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-free applications. <div>
arXiv:2506.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

<title>NERO: Explainable Out-of-Distribution Detection with Neuron-level Relevance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: deep learning, medical imaging, out-of-distribution detection, neuron-level relevance, explainable detection <br />
Summary: 
Neuron-level relevance-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method, named NERO, is proposed for enhancing model reliability in medical imaging tasks. The approach clusters neuron-level relevance for in-distribution (ID) samples to create centroids and uses a relevance distance metric to measure the deviation of new samples from these centroids. This method improves OOD separability compared to traditional feature or logit space-based approaches. The inclusion of scaled relevance in the bias term and feature norm combination further enhances performance. NERO also allows for explainable OOD detection, aiding in identifying anomalies in medical images. Experimental validations on gastrointestinal imaging datasets Kvasir and GastroVision demonstrate the superior performance of NERO over existing OOD detection methods across various deep learning architectures. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Medical report generation from imaging data is a challenging task in clinical practice. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with medical imaging data is explored through MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM). MRG-LLM combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

<title>Control and Realism: Best of Both Worlds in Layout-to-Image without Training</title>

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,} Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a 3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model, autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate versatility in handling a wide range of multimodal understanding and generation tasks across diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

<title>One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591</link>

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

<title>Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596</link>

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at https://github.com/MICV-yonsei/M2M-Reg.

<title>BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion</title>

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

<title>FindingDory: A Benchmark to Evaluate Memory in Embodied Agents</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

<title>Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

<title>Dual-Stage Value-Guided Inference with Margin-Based Reward Adjustment for Fast and Faithful VLM Captioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15649</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<title>Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Your Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction. We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building (17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore advanced methods to overcome them more effectively. Comparative analysis with another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C) average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters, with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale applications, leveraging features such as LiDAR and advanced alignment techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains, including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a perception-based path planning system for local planning around the neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a crowded street.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.

<title>Robust Instant Policy: Leveraging Student's t-Regression Model for Robust In-context Imitation Learning of Robot Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

<title>One-shot Face Sketch Synthesis in the Wild via Generative Diffusion Prior and Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: Multi-modal document pre-trained models have proven to be very effective in a variety of visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) tasks. Though existing document pre-trained models have achieved excellent performance on standard benchmarks for VrDU, the way they model and exploit the interactions between vision and language on documents has hindered them from better generalization ability and higher accuracy. In this work, we investigate the problem of vision-language joint representation learning for VrDU mainly from the perspective of supervisory signals. Specifically, a pre-training paradigm called Bi-VLDoc is proposed, in which a bidirectional vision-language supervision strategy and a vision-language hybrid-attention mechanism are devised to fully explore and utilize the interactions between these two modalities, to learn stronger cross-modal document representations with richer semantics. Benefiting from the learned informative cross-modal document representations, Bi-VLDoc significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used document understanding benchmarks, including Form Understanding (from 85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction (from 96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (from 96.08% to 97.12%). On Document Visual QA, Bi-VLDoc achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single model methods.

<title>Incorporating Pre-training Data Matters in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: In deep learning, initializing models with pre-trained weights has become the de facto practice for various downstream tasks. Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods typically adopt a backbone pre-trained on ImageNet, and focus on reducing the source-target domain discrepancy. However, the impact of pre-training on adaptation received little attention. In this study, we delve into UDA from the novel perspective of pre-training. We first demonstrate the impact of pre-training by analyzing the dynamic distribution discrepancies between pre-training data domain and the source/ target domain during adaptation. Then, we reveal that the target error also stems from the pre-training in the following two factors: 1) empirically, target error arises from the gradually degenerative pre-trained knowledge during adaptation; 2) theoretically, the error bound depends on difference between the gradient of loss function, \ie, on the target domain and pre-training data domain. To address these two issues, we redefine UDA as a three-domain problem, \ie, source domain, target domain, and pre-training data domain; then we propose a novel framework, named TriDA. We maintain the pre-trained knowledge and improve the error bound by incorporating pre-training data into adaptation for both vanilla UDA and source-free UDA scenarios. For efficiency, we introduce a selection strategy for pre-training data, and offer a solution with synthesized images when pre-training data is unavailable during adaptation. Notably, TriDA is effective even with a small amount of pre-training or synthesized images, and seamlessly complements the two scenario UDA methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We hope our work provides new insights for better understanding and application of domain adaptation.

Abstract: Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial 2D annotations that are labor-intensive to manual label. While existing datasets provide rich annotations on pre-recorded sequences, they fall short in labeling rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially hampering the generalization ability for perception models. In this paper, we present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel approach that combines coarse 3D annotations with noisy 2D semantic cues to generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint. Our key insight lies in exploiting the complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually enhance geometry and semantics. Specifically, we propose to leverage coarse 3D bounding primitives and noisy 2D semantic and instance predictions to guide geometry optimization, by encouraging predicted labels to match panoptic pseudo ground truth. Simultaneously, the improved geometry assists in filtering 3D&2D annotation noise by fusing semantics in 3D space via a learned semantic field. To further enhance appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid scene features, striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's state-of-the-art performance over label transfer methods on the challenging urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360 enables omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and spatiotemporally consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels. We make our code and data available at https://github.com/fuxiao0719/PanopticNeRF

Abstract: Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we introduce EmoEdit, which extends AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. Specifically, we first construct EmoEditSet, a large-scale AIM dataset comprising 40,120 paired data through emotion attribution and data construction. To make existing generative models emotion-aware, we design the Emotion adapter and train it using EmoEditSet. We further propose an instruction loss to capture the semantic variations in data pairs. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase the portability of our Emotion adapter to other diffusion-based models, enhancing their emotion knowledge with diverse semantics.

Abstract: Describing a scene in terms of primitives -- geometrically simple shapes that offer a parsimonious but accurate abstraction of structure -- is an established and difficult fitting problem. Different scenes require different numbers of primitives, and these primitives interact strongly. Existing methods are evaluated by predicting depth, normals and segmentation from the primitives, then evaluating the accuracy of those predictions. The state of the art method involves a learned regression procedure to predict a start point consisting of a fixed number of primitives, followed by a descent method to refine the geometry and remove redundant primitives.
  CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) representations are significantly enhanced by a set-differencing operation. Our representation incorporates negative primitives, which are differenced from the positive primitives. These notably enrich the geometry that the model can encode, while complicating the fitting problem. This paper demonstrates a method that can (a) incorporate these negative primitives and (b) choose the overall number of positive and negative primitives by ensembling. Extensive experiments on the standard NYUv2 dataset confirm that (a) this approach results in substantial improvements in depth representation and segmentation over SOTA and (b) negative primitives make a notable contribution to accuracy. Our method is robustly applicable across datasets: in a first, we evaluate primitive prediction for LAION images.

Abstract: We present TXL-PBC, a curated and re-annotated peripheral blood cell dataset constructed by integrating four publicly available resources: Blood Cell Count and Detection (BCCD), Blood Cell Detection Dataset (BCDD), Peripheral Blood Cells (PBC), and Raabin White Blood Cell (Raabin-WBC). Through rigorous sample selection, semi-automatic annotation using the YOLOv8n model, and comprehensive manual review, we ensured high annotation accuracy and consistency. The final dataset contains 1,260 images and 18,143 bounding box annotations for three major blood cell types: white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and platelets. We provide detailed visual analyses of the data distribution, demonstrating the diversity and balance of the dataset. To further validate the quality and utility of TXL-PBC, we trained several mainstream object detection models, including YOLOv5s, YOLOv8s, YOLOv11s, SSD300, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, and report their baseline performance. The TXL-PBC dataset is openly available on Figshare and GitHub, offering a valuable resource for the development and benchmarking of blood cell detection models and related machine learning research.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for ensuring the safety of machine learning systems and has shaped the field of OOD detection. Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then, we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection. Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.

Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by aggregating local models without sharing data. Traditional supervised learning requires image data with labels, but data labeling involves significant manual effort. Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL, eliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL methods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources and storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL requires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS), which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead of a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we propose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL. Furthermore, we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called DRL-BFSSL. In this scheme, BS allocates the Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of vehicles to minimize energy consumption and latency, while aggregating received models based on the motion blur level. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed aggregation and resource allocation methods.

Abstract: Existing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception methods rely on accurate multi-agent 3D annotations. Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and expensive to collect and annotate real-world data, especially for V2X systems. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning framwork for V2X cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance the perception performance. Specifically, multi-agent sensing information is aggregated to form a holistic view and a novel proxy task is formulated to reconstruct the LiDAR point clouds across multiple connected agents to better reason multi-agent spatial correlations. Besides, we develop a V2X bird-eye-view (BEV) guided masking strategy which effectively allows the model to pay attention to 3D features across heterogeneous V2X agents (i.e., vehicles and infrastructure) in the BEV space. Noticeably, such a masking strategy effectively pretrains the 3D encoder with a multi-agent LiDAR point cloud reconstruction objective and is compatible with mainstream cooperative perception backbones. Our approach, validated through extensive experiments on representative datasets (i.e., V2X-Real, V2V4Real, and OPV2V) and multiple state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods (i.e., AttFuse, F-Cooper, and V2X-ViT), leads to a performance boost across all V2X settings. Notably, CooPre achieves a 4% mAP improvement on V2X-Real dataset and surpasses baseline performance using only 50% of the training data, highlighting its data efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's powerful performance in cross-domain transferability and robustness under challenging scenarios. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ucla-mobility/CooPre.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.

Abstract: With the significant advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), concerns about their potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/wangyu-ovo/MML.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.

Abstract: Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

Abstract: Surround-View System (SVS) is an essential component in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and requires precise calibrations. However, conventional offline extrinsic calibration methods are cumbersome and time-consuming as they rely heavily on physical patterns. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on short-range areas surrounding the vehicle, resulting in lower calibration quality in more distant zones. To address these limitations, we propose Click-Calib, a pattern-free approach for offline SVS extrinsic calibration. Without requiring any special setup, the user only needs to click a few keypoints on the ground in natural scenes. Unlike other offline calibration approaches, Click-Calib optimizes camera poses over a wide range by minimizing reprojection distance errors of keypoints, thereby achieving accurate calibrations at both short and long distances. Furthermore, Click-Calib supports both single-frame and multiple-frame modes, with the latter offering even better results. Evaluations on our in-house dataset and the public WoodScape dataset demonstrate its superior accuracy and robustness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy near 60\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives. Data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/doc-doc/EgoBlind.

Abstract: Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. We will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data at \href{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}.

Abstract: Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a fundamental task in document understanding. However, existing DLA and adaptation methods often require access to large-scale source data and target labels. This requirements severely limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained domains, such as financial statements, medical records, and proprietary business documents. According to our observation, directly transferring source-domain fine-tuned models on target domains often results in a significant performance drop (Avg. -32.64%). In this work, we introduce Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA), aiming for adapting a pre-trained source DLA models to an unlabeled target domain, without access to any source data. To address this challenge, we establish the first SFDLA benchmark, covering three major DLA datasets for geometric- and content-aware adaptation. Furthermore, we propose Document Layout Analysis Adapter (DLAdapter), a novel framework that is designed to improve source-free adaptation across document domains. Our method achieves a +4.21% improvement over the source-only baseline and a +2.26% gain over existing source-free methods from PubLayNet to DocLayNet. We believe this work will inspire the DLA community to further investigate source-free document understanding. To support future research of the community, the benchmark, models, and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/s3setewe/sfdla-DLAdapter.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have increasingly emphasized document visual grounding to achieve better human-computer interaction, accessibility, and detailed understanding. However, its application to visualizations such as charts remains under-explored due to the inherent complexity of interleaved visual-numerical relationships in chart images. Existing chart understanding methods primarily focus on answering questions without explicitly identifying the visual elements that support their predictions. To bridge this gap, we introduce RefChartQA, a novel benchmark that integrates Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) with visual grounding, enabling models to refer elements at multiple granularities within chart images. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation by instruction-tuning 5 state-of-the-art VLMs across different categories. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating spatial awareness via grounding improves response accuracy by over 15%, reducing hallucinations, and improving model reliability. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing text-spatial alignment, such as architectural improvements in TinyChart, which leverages a token-merging module for enhanced feature fusion. Our dataset is open-sourced for community development and further advancements. All models and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/moured/RefChartQA.

Abstract: The challenge of detecting violent incidents in urban surveillance systems is compounded by the voluminous and diverse nature of video data. This paper presents a targeted approach using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) to address these issues, specifically employing the Federated Learning with Personalization Layers method within the Flower framework. Our methodology adapts learning models to the unique data characteristics of each surveillance node, effectively managing the heterogeneous and non-IID nature of surveillance video data. Through rigorous experiments conducted on balanced and imbalanced datasets, our PFL models demonstrated enhanced accuracy and efficiency, achieving up to 99.3% accuracy. This study underscores the potential of PFL to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of surveillance systems, offering a robust, privacy-preserving solution for violence detection in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical attacks (e.g., printed photos) and digital threats (e.g., DeepFake), which are currently being studied as independent visual tasks, such as Face Anti-Spoofing and Forgery Detection. The inherent differences among various attack types present significant challenges in identifying a common feature space, making it difficult to develop a unified framework for detecting data from both attack modalities simultaneously. Inspired by the efficacy of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in learning across diverse domains, we explore utilizing multiple experts to learn the distinct features of various attack types. However, the feature distributions of physical and digital attacks overlap and differ. This suggests that relying solely on distinct experts to learn the unique features of each attack type may overlook shared knowledge between them. To address these issues, we propose SUEDE, the Shared Unified Experts for Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection Enhancement. SUEDE combines a shared expert (always activated) to capture common features for both attack types and multiple routed experts (selectively activated) for specific attack types. Further, we integrate CLIP as the base network to ensure the shared expert benefits from prior visual knowledge and align visual-text representations in a unified space. Extensive results demonstrate SUEDE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unified detection methods.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to anomaly detection and localization in synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR), expanding upon the existing patch distribution modeling framework (PaDiM). We introduce the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric, providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that combines the advantages of style augmentation and random erasing by selectively replacing image subregions with style-transferred patches. Our approach first applies a random style transfer to training images, then randomly substitutes selected areas of these images with patches derived from the style-transferred versions. This method is able to seamlessly accommodate a wide range of existing style transfer algorithms and can be readily integrated into diverse data augmentation pipelines. By incorporating our strategy, the training process becomes more robust and less prone to overfitting. Comparative experiments demonstrate that, relative to previous style augmentation methods, our technique achieves superior performance and faster convergence.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and size of previously unseen instances from predefined categories, requiring strong generalization across diverse object instances. Although many previous methods attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes. To address this issue, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our method first predicts semantically consistent and geometrically informative keypoints using an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Detector, then refines them: (1) a Local Keypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a simple yet effective Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing backward feature sequence. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a separation loss to encourage uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint distribution. The resulting keypoints are mapped to a canonical space for 6D pose and size regression. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D show that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance with 16.7M parameters and runs at 36 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090D GPU.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.

Abstract: As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is available \href{https://github.com/HongHanh2104/T2A-Think-Twice-Before-Adaptation}{here}.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are consistent with our predictions.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

Abstract: Multi-modal medical image synthesis involves nonlinear transformation of tissue signals between source and target modalities, where tissues exhibit contextual interactions across diverse spatial distances. As such, the utility of a network architecture in synthesis depends on its ability to express these contextual features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer high local precision at the expense of poor sensitivity to long-range context. While transformers promise to alleviate this issue, they suffer from an unfavorable trade-off between sensitivity to long- versus short-range context due to the intrinsic complexity of attention filters. To effectively capture contextual features while avoiding the complexity-driven trade-offs, here we introduce a novel multi-modal synthesis method, I2I-Mamba, based on the state space modeling (SSM) framework. Focusing on semantic representations across a hybrid residual architecture, I2I-Mamba leverages novel dual-domain Mamba (ddMamba) blocks for complementary contextual modeling in image and Fourier domains, while maintaining spatial precision with convolutional layers. Diverting from conventional raster-scan trajectories, ddMamba leverages novel SSM operators based on a spiral-scan trajectory to learn context with enhanced radial coverage and angular isotropy, and a channel-mixing layer to aggregate context across the channel dimension. Comprehensive demonstrations on multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNNs, transformers and SSMs.

<title>FLARE: Towards Universal Dataset Purification against Backdoor Attacks</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS

Abstract: Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations, complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity loss.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Summary:
Viewport prediction is essential in tile-based 360 video streaming systems. Current trajectory-based methods lack robustness and fail to effectively fuse different types of input data, leading to error accumulation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method, Multi-modal Fusion Transformer (MFTR), which employs transformer-based networks to capture intra- and inter-modality relations and predict future viewports based on tile classification. By categorizing future tiles as user interested or not, MFTR selects the viewport containing the most user interested tiles. Experimental results on PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze datasets demonstrate that MFTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, while also being computationally efficient. This approach offers improved robustness and interpretability compared to traditional trajectory-based prediction methods.

Abstract: Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.

Summary: 
This study presents an attention-based method utilizing binary attention masks to focus on specific image regions during object prediction. The approach aims to address biases in object perception caused by contextual influences, especially in out-of-distribution backgrounds. The proposed two-stage framework involves the initial processing of the entire image to identify object parts and relevant regions, followed by a second stage that uses attention masking to narrow its focus to these regions. By training both stages jointly, the model can refine its understanding and filter out potentially irrelevant information. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that this approach enhances robustness against spurious correlations and background variations. The code for this method is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Summary: 
Object detection and identification are essential in computer vision, with applications in object tracking and image retrieval. A feature-based approach is proposed for detecting and identifying distorted occurrences of a template in a scene image. The Delaunay triangulation of template features is used to guide the incremental grouping of feature matches. This iterative approach starts with a single triangle and evaluates matches based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties. The solution allows object identification in situations where geometric models do not hold, enabling detection of non-planar or distorted objects in images. In scenarios with minimal distortion, the approach performs as well as homography-based RANSAC, while showing better performance when deformation is significant. <div>

Abstract: Object detection and identification is surely a fundamental topic in the computer vision field; it plays a crucial role in many applications such as object tracking, industrial robots control, image retrieval, etc. We propose a feature-based approach for detecting and identifying distorted occurrences of a given template in a scene image by incremental grouping of feature matches between the image and the template. For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach performs just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in scenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation becomes relevant our method shows better description performance.

CDST significantly improves the style similarity by multi-feature image embeddings compression and preserves strong editing capability via our new CDST style definition inspired by Diffusion UNet disentanglement law. By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that CDST achieves state-of-the-art results on various style transfer tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have transformed visual content creation, producing highly realistic images from natural language prompts. However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize the need for more inclusive datasets and development practices to foster fairness in generative visual systems.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Summary:
In this work, the authors explore the use of LiDAR, human skeleton poses, IMU data, and text for human activity understanding through a joint embedding space model called DeSPITE. By combining datasets and synchronizing data across modalities, they demonstrate the effectiveness of DeSPITE for tasks such as Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval. The model is shown to be a valuable pre-training strategy for point cloud human activity recognition in datasets like MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR. Overall, the study highlights the potential of utilizing multiple modalities for enhanced human activity understanding and showcases the benefits of a joint embedding space approach like DeSPITE. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) being an effective privacy-preserving alternative to RGB cameras to perceive human activities, it remains largely underexplored in the context of multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding (e.g., human activity recognition (HAR), retrieval, or person re-identification (RE-ID)). To close this gap, our work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four modalities through noise contrastive estimation. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including Skeleton<->Pointcloud<->IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval. Furthermore, we show that DeSPITE is an effective pre-training strategy for point cloud HAR through experiments in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.

Summary:  
Surface changes on Earth are crucial for environmental monitoring, but detecting changes in satellite imagery is challenging due to the lack of annotated data, especially for rare categories. To address this, OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method, is introduced. By leveraging the relative order of images in a time series, OPTIMUS can detect long-lasting changes in satellite images effectively. The model outperforms baselines in distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones, with an AUROC score improvement from 56.3% to 87.6%. This approach offers a promising solution to efficiently detect and monitor changes in satellite imagery for environmental surveillance. The code and dataset for OPTIMUS are publicly available for further research and application.

Abstract: In the face of pressing environmental issues in the 21st century, monitoring surface changes on Earth is more important than ever. Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines.

<div> Keywords: semi-supervised segmentation, vision-language models, spatial grounding, HierVL, regularization losses

Summary: 
HierVL is a new framework that combines vision and language information for semi-supervised semantic segmentation tasks. It addresses the challenges of generalization, boundary localization, and label scarcity by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture. The framework includes a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator, Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module, and Dual-Query Transformer Decoder to improve segmentation accuracy. Additional regularization losses are introduced to maintain alignment between vision and language data during training. HierVL achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with minimal labeled data, demonstrating significant improvements in intersection over union metrics. The language-guided segmentation approach enhances fine-grained, instance-aware generalization and closes the label efficiency gap in semantic segmentation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation remains challenging under severe label scarcity and domain variability. Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization. Vision-Language Models offer robust, domain-invariant semantics but lack the spatial grounding required for dense prediction. We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation closes the label efficiency gap and unlocks new levels of fine-grained, instance-aware generalization.

Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.

<div> Object Detection, Out-Of-Distribution, Evaluation Protocol, Unknown Objects, Open Set Community<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper addresses the limitations of the current evaluation protocol for Out-Of-Distribution Object Detection, emphasizing the importance of detecting unknown objects in safety-critical applications. By creating new evaluation splits based on semantic similarity, the authors enrich the existing benchmark to better assess the detection of unknown objects. They incorporate metrics from the Open Set community to provide a comprehensive evaluation of methods in detecting, ignoring, and misclassifying unknown objects. The study highlights that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize but may be mistaken for ID objects, while far objects are harder to localize but less likely to be misclassified. This research sheds light on the challenges of detecting unknown objects and emphasizes the need for improved evaluation protocols in object detection tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Object Detection (OD) methods predominantly operate under a closed-world assumption, where test-time categories match those encountered during training. However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\textit{near}$, $\textit{far}$, and $\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\textit{Far}$ and $\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.

Summary:
In this study, the authors address the problem of disentangling 3D from large vision-language models to generate generative 3D portraits. They demonstrate the ability to control appearance attributes like age, hair style, and glasses through free-form text and manipulate face expression and camera pose in 3D geometry. By leveraging a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) and a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME), they employ canonicalization to a 2D reference frame and address entanglement issues caused by noise in the LVLM's embedding space. Introducing a Jacobian regularization technique, they efficiently compute the regularization and enhance output quality and diversity. Their approach allows for precise control over 3D generators using 2D face data without the need for extensive labeling or training of large models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of disentangling 3D from large vision-language models, which we show on generative 3D portraits. This allows free-form text control of appearance attributes like age, hair style, and glasses, and 3D geometry control of face expression and camera pose. In this setting, we assume we use a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) to generate from a smaller 2D dataset with no additional paired labels and with a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME). First, we disentangle using canonicalization to a 2D reference frame from a deformable neural 3D triplane representation. But another form of entanglement arises from the significant noise in the LVLM's embedding space that describes irrelevant features. This damages output quality and diversity, but we overcome this with a Jacobian regularization that can be computed efficiently with a stochastic approximator. Compared to existing methods, our approach produces portraits with added text and 3D control, where portraits remain consistent when either control is changed. Broadly, this approach lets creators control 3D generators on their own 2D face data without needing resources to label large data or train large models.

Summary: 
SimpleDoc is a new framework for Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) that improves on existing methods by efficiently gathering evidence pages. It utilizes a lightweight retrieval-augmented approach, combining embedding similarity with page summaries for candidate filtering and re-ranking. The framework includes a single Visual Language Model-based reasoner agent that iteratively retrieves relevant pages into working memory until confidently answering a question. SimpleDoc surpasses previous baselines by 3.2% on average across four DocVQA datasets, achieving superior performance with fewer retrieved pages. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of multi-modality in DocVQA tasks, offering a practical and effective solution for handling questions that require referencing multiple pages and different types of information. The code for SimpleDoc is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

arXiv:2506.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a practical yet challenging task, which is to ask questions based on documents while referring to multiple pages and different modalities of information, e.g, images and tables. To handle multi-modality, recent methods follow a similar Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but utilize Visual Language Models (VLMs) based embedding model to embed and retrieve relevant pages as images, and generate answers with VLMs that can accept an image as input. In this paper, we introduce SimpleDoc, a lightweight yet powerful retrieval - augmented framework for DocVQA. It boosts evidence page gathering by first retrieving candidates through embedding similarity and then filtering and re-ranking these candidates based on page summaries. A single VLM-based reasoner agent repeatedly invokes this dual-cue retriever, iteratively pulling fresh pages into a working memory until the question is confidently answered. SimpleDoc outperforms previous baselines by 3.2% on average on 4 DocVQA datasets with much fewer pages retrieved. Our code is available at https://github.com/ag2ai/SimpleDoc.

<div> Keywords: Face super-resolution, Computational efficiency, Mamba, CNN, Dual-Path Network

Summary: 
The paper introduces FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network for face super-resolution that addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality results with limited computational costs. By leveraging the strengths of Mamba for low-frequency features and CNN for high-frequency features, FADPNet decomposes facial features into different frequency components and processes them through specialized branches. A Mamba-based Low-Frequency Enhancement Block (LFEB) and a CNN-based Deep Position-Aware Attention (DPA) module are introduced to enhance low and high-frequency regions, respectively. Additionally, a High-Frequency Refinement (HFR) module further refines the representations. This approach achieves a balance between FSR quality and model efficiency, outperforming existing methods. FADPNet demonstrates superior performance in capturing both global interactions and spatial details, making it a promising solution for face super-resolution under limited computational costs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) under limited computational costs remains an open problem. Existing approaches typically treat all facial pixels equally, resulting in suboptimal allocation of computational resources and degraded FSR performance. CNN is relatively sensitive to high-frequency facial features, such as component contours and facial outlines. Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers. Motivated by these observations, we propose FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network that decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components and processes them via dedicated branches. For low-frequency regions, we introduce a Mamba-based Low-Frequency Enhancement Block (LFEB), which combines state-space attention with squeeze-and-excitation operations to extract low-frequency global interactions and emphasize informative channels. For high-frequency regions, we design a CNN-based Deep Position-Aware Attention (DPA) module to enhance spatially-dependent structural details, complemented by a lightweight High-Frequency Refinement (HFR) module that further refines frequency-specific representations. Through the above designs, our method achieves an excellent balance between FSR quality and model efficiency, outperforming existing approaches.

<div> Motion Object Segmentation, Knowledge Distillation, Autonomous Driving, Bird's Eye View, Real-time Efficiency  
Summary:  
Motion Object Segmentation (MOS) is essential for autonomous driving tasks, but balancing accuracy and real-time processing can be challenging. This study introduces a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS to enhance accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. By using a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based student model and a non-projection teacher model, motion-related features are better learned to reduce false positives and negatives. Tailored distillation strategies are applied to handle class imbalances, improving overall performance. Dynamic upsampling and network optimization further enhance efficiency and reduce overfitting. The proposed method achieves an IoU of 78.8% on the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and competitive results on the Apollo dataset. The KDMOS implementation is publicly available on GitHub for research and development purposes.

Abstract: Motion Object Segmentation (MOS) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enhances localization, path planning, map construction, scene flow estimation, and future state prediction. While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting. Our method achieves a notable IoU of 78.8% on the hidden test set of the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and delivers competitive results on the Apollo dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct two research objectives: i) explore the learned embedding space of BiomedCLIP, an open-source large vision language model, to analyse meaningful class separations, and ii) quantify the limitations of BiomedCLIP when applied to a highly imbalanced, out-of-distribution multi-label medical dataset. We experiment on IU-xray dataset, which exhibits the aforementioned criteria, and evaluate BiomedCLIP in classifying images (radiographs) in three contexts: zero-shot inference, full finetuning, and linear probing. The results show that the model under zero-shot settings over-predicts all labels, leading to poor precision and inter-class separability. Full fine-tuning improves classification of distinct diseases, while linear probing detects overlapping features. We demonstrate visual understanding of the model using Grad-CAM heatmaps and compare with 15 annotations by a radiologist. We highlight the need for careful adaptations of the models to foster reliability and applicability in a real-world setting. The code for the experiments in this work is available and maintained on GitHub.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is essential for applications in robotics and surveillance systems. While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

To address the challenge of long sequence autoregressive modeling, VideoMAR employs temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training. It also utilizes a progressive temperature strategy during inference to mitigate accumulation errors. The model incorporates spatial and temporal extrapolation abilities through 3D rotary embeddings and benefits from high efficiency with temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation. VideoMAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the VBench-I2V benchmark while using significantly fewer parameters, training data, and GPU resources. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

Abstract: In recirculating aquaculture systems, accurate and effective assessment of fish feeding intensity is crucial for reducing feed costs and calculating optimal feeding times. However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments further verified the key role of the proposed improvement strategy in improving the robustness and feature utilization efficiency of model, which can effectively improve the accuracy of the quantitative results of fish feeding intensity.

Abstract: Deep learning-based pathological image analysis presents unique challenges due to the practical constraints of network design. Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.

<div> Keywords: online surgical phase recognition, uncertainty modeling, deep generative model, meta-learning, frame-level distribution estimation

Summary: 
Meta-SurDiff, a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model, addresses uncertainties in online surgical phase recognition by modeling frame ambiguity and unbalanced phase distribution. It leverages deep generative models and meta-learning to estimate frame-level distributions for precise recognition. For ambiguous frames, a classification diffusion model assesses confidence at a finer-grained level. For unbalanced phase distribution, meta-learning enhances classification boundaries. Experimental validation on five datasets including Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD demonstrates the effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff using practical metrics. The datasets cover laparoscopic and ophthalmic surgeries, as well as daily care activities. Code for Meta-SurDiff will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Online surgical phase recognition has drawn great attention most recently due to its potential downstream applications closely related to human life and health. Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries. We will release the code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between humans and objects has gained much attention in recent years. Existing human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods mainly focus on the third-person perspectives, overlooking a more intuitive way from the egocentric view of HOI, namely Ego-HOI. This paper introduces an Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset to promote the benchmarking and development of Ego-HOI detection. Our Ego-HOIBench comprises more than 27K egocentric images with high-quality hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 fine-grained interaction categories and locations, covering a rich diversity of scenarios, object types, and hand configurations in daily activities. In addition, we explore and adapt third-person HOI detection methods to Ego-HOIBench and illustrate the challenges of hand-occluded objects and the complexity of single- and two-hand interactions. To build a new baseline, we propose a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme, which leverages hand pose and geometric information as valuable cues for interpreting interactions. Specifically, the HGIR scheme explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals and refines the interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This scheme enables the model to obtain a robust and powerful interaction representation, significantly improving the Ego-HOI detection capability. Our approach is lightweight and effective, and it can be easily applied to HOI baselines in a plug-and-play manner to achieve state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench.

Summary:
Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS) proposes a memory-efficient framework for high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction. It utilizes hierarchical block-level optimization by first generating a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. The scene is then partitioned into blocks for refinement with high-resolution data, ensuring seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP) is employed to remove minimally contributing Gaussians, reducing computational demands. Normal priors from a pretrained model are incorporated to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in real-time 3D scene reconstruction, but faces memory scalability issues in high-resolution scenarios. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks.

arXiv:2506.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is a critical task in scene understanding that aims to identify objects in 3D scenes based on text descriptions. However, existing methods rely on separately pre-trained vision and text encoders, resulting in a significant gap between the two modalities in terms of spatial geometry and semantic categories. This discrepancy often causes errors in object positioning and classification. The paper proposes UniSpace-3D, which innovatively introduces a unified representation space for 3DVG, effectively bridging the gap between visual and textual features. Specifically, UniSpace-3D incorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that leverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a unified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two modalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces the modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes the positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points aligned with textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on the ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR, place recognition, point cloud density, geometric reasoning, 3D representation

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for LiDAR-based place recognition in robotics and autonomous driving systems. The current methodologies face challenges due to inconsistent point cloud density and lack of discriminative power in complex scenarios. The proposed framework utilizes an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points to overcome density variations and achieve uniform distribution. By deriving occupancy grid and normal vector information, the framework generates descriptors that fuse geometric information from both macro-level spatial layouts and micro-scale surface geometries. Extensive experiments on various datasets show state-of-the-art performance, striking a balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization. The approach is resilient, scalable, and suitable for historical maps. The code for the framework will be open-sourced in the future. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based place recognition serves as a crucial enabler for long-term autonomy in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability. Our code will be open-sourced in the future.

<div> Keywords: bridge inspection, defect classification, pixel-level, synthetic dataset, model performance

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of automating visual bridge inspection to enhance efficiency and accuracy. The dacl10k dataset is the largest and most diverse dataset for concrete bridge inspections but exhibits class imbalance, leading to poor model performance in segmenting fine-grained classes like cracks and cavities. To overcome this limitation, the researchers introduce "synth-dacl," a set of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures to balance class distribution and improve model performance, especially in crack and cavity segmentation. Incorporating the synth-dacl extensions results in substantial improvements in model robustness across perturbed test sets. Models trained on dacl10k combined with all synthetic extensions achieve a 2% increase in mean IoU, F1 score, Recall, and Precision on perturbed test sets compared to those trained solely on dacl10k. The synthetic dataset extensions prove to be effective in enhancing model performance in real-world conditions for visual bridge inspection and defect classification at a pixel level. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adequate bridge inspection is increasingly challenging in many countries due to growing ailing stocks, compounded with a lack of staff and financial resources. Automating the key task of visual bridge inspection, classification of defects and building components on pixel level, improves efficiency, increases accuracy and enhances safety in the inspection process and resulting building assessment. Models overtaking this task must cope with an assortment of real-world conditions. They must be robust to variations in image quality, as well as background texture, as defects often appear on surfaces of diverse texture and degree of weathering. dacl10k is the largest and most diverse dataset for real-world concrete bridge inspections. However, the dataset exhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance particularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities. This work introduces "synth-dacl", a compilation of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures. These extensions are designed to balance class distribution in dacl10k and enhance model performance, especially for crack and cavity segmentation. When incorporating the synth-dacl extensions, we observe substantial improvements in model robustness across 15 perturbed test sets. Notably, on the perturbed test set, a model trained on dacl10k combined with all synthetic extensions achieves a 2% increase in mean IoU, F1 score, Recall, and Precision compared to the same model trained solely on dacl10k.

Summary:
The paper discusses the use of background subtraction-based methods for detecting temporarily stationary objects in visual tracking applications. Two schemes were proposed for stationary object detection, comparing them in terms of detection performance and computational complexity. The first approach involved a single background, while the second used dual backgrounds with different learning rates to detect temporarily stopped objects. The use of normalized cross correlation (NCC) based image comparison allowed for monitoring and tracking detected stationary objects in video scenes. The method proved to be robust against partial occlusion, short-time full occlusion, and illumination changes, operating in real-time. <div>

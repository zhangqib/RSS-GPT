<div> Keywords: Autonomous vehicles, Point cloud data, Object counting, Querying, CounterNet

Summary:
CounterNet is introduced to accurately count objects in large-scale point cloud data, addressing the limitations of existing detection models. The network focuses on detecting object presence by finding object centers, improving counting accuracy. A feature map partitioning strategy with overlapping regions enables better handling of objects in complex traffic scenes. A per-frame dynamic model selection strategy adapts to varying frame characteristics, selecting the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories. This enhancement results in more reliable query outcomes for three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, essential for tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, and congestion monitoring. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

<div> Keywords: whole-body biometric recognition, multimodal, score-fusion, Mixture of Experts, quality estimation

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, Quality-guided Mixture of score-fusion Experts (QME), aimed at improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). This approach addresses the limitations of traditional unimodal systems by integrating multiple biometric modalities such as face, gait, and body. QME incorporates a quality estimator to assess the modality-specific quality and a score triplet loss to enhance metric performance. The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in various whole-body biometric datasets by achieving state-of-the-art results across different metrics compared to baseline methods. QME successfully overcomes challenges such as model misalignment in similarity score domain and data quality variability, making it a promising solution for multimodal and multi-model biometric recognition tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems. Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g., weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion \textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

Summary:
Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones. The bias-free Syn-TA dataset proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings. Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. The study explores how disentangling coarse and fine motions can enhance recognition in temporally challenging datasets. This research introduces a crucial benchmark for evaluating motion transferability in action recognition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2) Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action recognition. Datasets and relevant code: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/Motion-Transfer.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Monado SLAM dataset aimed at addressing the limitations of existing tracking systems for head-mounted sensors in humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have improved tracking, challenges such as high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, and adverse lighting conditions still pose difficulties. Existing datasets may not adequately cover these real-world issues, prompting the creation of the Monado SLAM dataset. Real sequences from multiple virtual reality headsets are included in the dataset, released under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license to drive further research and development in VIO/SLAM technology. This dataset aims to facilitate progress in tackling challenging scenarios like long tracking sessions and low-textured areas, which are vital for enhancing the performance of head-mounted tracking systems. <div>

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

<div> evaluation metric, generative video models, World Consistency Score, internal world consistency, video coherence<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new evaluation metric called World Consistency Score (WCS) for generative video models. WCS focuses on internal world consistency in generated videos by incorporating four sub-components: object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty. These components measure various aspects of temporal and physical coherence in videos. WCS combines these submetrics through a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score aligned with human judgments. The article details the motivation for WCS, the computation of each submetric using open-source tools, and the training of weights using human preference data. An experimental validation plan is outlined, which involves testing WCS's correlation with human evaluations, sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics like FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, and FVMD. The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models based on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps in existing metrics. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video. These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics, formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools (trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

<div> Curiosity-driven exploration, Active Geo-localization, Reinforcement Learning, Generalization, Robustness<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GeoExplorer, an agent for Active Geo-localization (AGL) that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike traditional methods that rely on distance-based rewards, GeoExplorer's goal-agnostic approach enables robust and diverse exploration in various environments. By effectively modeling the environment, GeoExplorer demonstrates improved generalization and robustness in localizing unfamiliar targets. The agent's capabilities are validated through experiments on four AGL benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in various settings. By emphasizing curiosity-driven exploration, GeoExplorer offers a more reliable exploration strategy and enhances the agent's ability to localize goals accurately. This innovative approach has the potential to address challenges in distance estimation and improve performance in challenging AGL tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text), within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward. They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic, enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings, particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR, 3D sensors, point clouds, uncertainty, 3D object detection

Summary: 
Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC) is proposed as a novel 3D scene representation, enhancing each point with a probability attribute to capture measurement uncertainty. By incorporating the uncertainty information from raw LiDAR measurements into the point cloud construction, PPC improves robustness in downstream perception models. Inference approaches using PPC for 3D object detection demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods. These methods are lightweight and adaptable for integration into existing 3D processing pipelines. Simulations and real-world captures validate the effectiveness of PPC-based 3D inference methods in challenging scenarios like long-distance, low-albedo objects, and strong ambient light. The project webpage provides additional details on PPC and its applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects, producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

Summary:
The study introduces Selective Modality Shifting (SMS) to quantify biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in binary classification tasks using medical imaging datasets. It assesses six VLMs, revealing a reliance on text input over visual cues, even when complementary visual information is available. The study finds a marked dependency on text details, overshadowing image content, highlighting the need for genuinely integrated multimodal medical models. The perturbation-based approach exposes modality-specific biases, showing a disparity between model performance and calibration in both unperturbed and perturbed settings. Qualitative attention-based analysis further confirms the dominance of text information over visual cues. The findings emphasize the significance of designing and evaluating medical models that truly integrate visual and textual inputs.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Summary: 
Structured graph "lineages" are defined, growing hierarchically with exponential increases in vertices and edges. Bipartite graphs connect levels and constrain matrices, while prolongation maps create distance measures between levels. A category of graded graphs allows for skeletal variants of algebraic operations. Skeletal binary operators exhibit algebraic and category-theoretic properties similar to standard operators. Graph lineages and skeletal constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Unary operators for graded graphs—thickening and escalation—are derived for creating multiscale graphs and search frontiers. This algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchies is well-suited for defining hierarchical model architectures and local algorithms, demonstrated for deep neural networks and multigrid methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.

<div> Keywords: real personality recognition, expressive behaviours, cognitive simulation, graph neural network, end-to-end strategy

Summary: <br /><br />Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to assess human real personality traits based on their expressive behaviours. Existing solutions often struggle to accurately infer real personalities from these behaviours, leading to subpar recognition performance. To address this issue, a novel approach is proposed that simulates personalized internal cognition from easily accessible external audio-visual behaviours of the target individual. This simulated cognition is represented as a graph structure using a 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) for personality trait inference. An end-to-end strategy is employed to jointly train the cognition simulation, graph construction, and personality recognition modules. By focusing on the association between real personality and internal cognition, this approach offers a more efficient and accurate way to recognize real personalities from expressive behaviours. <div>
arXiv:2508.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions, is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach that utilizes frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings for semantic guidance in segmentation tasks. The Parallel-Text adapter design injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enhancing segmentation performance while keeping the original architecture mostly frozen. By modifying the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, the adapter preserves the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Experimental results on the COD10K dataset and subsets of COCO and ADE20K demonstrate improved segmentation performance when incorporating fixed text embeddings as input. This work represents the first instance of using text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset, indicating the effectiveness of integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Summary:
In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification where there is minimal data, dealing with image ambiguities caused by multiple objects or complex backgrounds can lead to performance degradation. This study demonstrates that incorporating information about the local positioning of objects in an image can significantly improve classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. Utilizing the Segment Anything Model or unsupervised foreground object extraction methods can achieve a notable portion of this improvement by simply highlighting a single pixel of the object of interest. By leveraging these techniques, classification performance can be enhanced even with limited training data, offering a promising avenue for improving few-shot image classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

<div> Keywords: depth map super-resolution, convolutional neural network, transformer, multi-scale fusion, state space modeling

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel depth map super-resolution model, MSF-UM, that combines the efficiency of Mamba's state-space modeling with a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. By integrating a residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module, the model can capture both local features and long-distance dependencies in depth maps. A multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy is employed to utilize high-frequency texture information from the color image for guiding the super-resolution process. The proposed MSF-UM outperforms existing methods by reducing the number of model parameters and achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness and superior generalization ability, especially in large-scale depth map super-resolution tasks. <div>

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba (MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

Summary: 
PointGauss is a novel framework for efficient multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. The method utilizes a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder to generate 3D instance masks quickly and a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system for multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show significant performance gains over existing methods in multi-view mIoU, with improved computational efficiency. A new dataset, DesktopObjects-360, is introduced to address current benchmark limitations, featuring complex multi-object scenes, globally consistent 2D annotations, large-scale training data, full 360-degree coverage, and 3D evaluation masks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute, and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to 31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency. To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus, inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for continual learning in generative vision-language models. It addresses the issue of neglecting language instructions in favor of visual inputs by proposing a mixture of visual projectors specialized in translating visual information based on instruction context. An expert recommendation strategy is utilized to reuse experts for similar tasks, and expert pruning is implemented to reduce interference from previous tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in generating instruction-following responses. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models (VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating instruction-following responses.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (TITAN-Guide), a new approach to training-free conditioning for diffusion models. Unlike existing methods, TITAN-Guide effectively manages memory requirements and provides more optimal control in the guidance process. By optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a guiding model, the approach improves T2V performance across various diffusion guidance benchmarks. The study focuses on forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with different directional directives. TITAN-Guide demonstrates the ability to significantly enhance T2V performance while minimizing memory requirements, making it a valuable tool for tasks that require intense computation. The code, models, and demo for TITAN-Guide are available on their website for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2508.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks. Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However, the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues, and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model. In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces AniMer+, an extension of the AniMer framework, which uses a high-capacity Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design to reconstruct mammals and birds. The model partitions network layers into species-specific and shared components, allowing for efficient learning of anatomical features. To address the lack of 3D training data for birds, a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline was introduced, creating the CtrlAni3D and CtrlAVES3D synthetic datasets. Trained on a mixture of real and synthetic data, AniMer+ outperformed existing methods, including on the challenging Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the novel network architecture and synthetic datasets in improving performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach for enhancing low-light images captured by event cameras. It decouples the enhancement pipeline into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. The visibility restoration network incorporates amplitude-phase entanglement to improve image visibility. A fusion strategy is employed to refine image structure by aligning information from the frame and event data. Spatial-frequency interpolation is used to generate diverse negative samples for training, contributing to the development of a contrastive loss function that aids in learning discriminative representations. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models. <div>
arXiv:2508.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency, provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution, capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance. Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.

Summary:<br />
Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting pre-trained models to specific target concepts. However, fine-tuning with few images can create a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model. Existing sampling guidance methods have limitations in effectively guiding output towards a well-balanced space. To address these limitations, the proposed personalization guidance method leverages an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. This method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which solely depend on guidance scales, this method explicitly steers outputs towards a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results show improved text alignment and target distribution fidelity, seamlessly integrating with various fine-tuning strategies.<br />  <div>

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning. Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

<div> Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter, Multi-object tracking, ego-vehicle, dynamic scenarios, MotionScaleNet <br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper addresses the limitations of traditional tracking-by-detection methods in dynamic scenarios by introducing the Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF). SG-LKF takes into account ego-vehicle speed variations to improve tracking stability and accuracy. The model incorporates MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a network that predicts key parameters for SG-LKF. A self-supervised trajectory consistency loss is introduced to enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity. Experimental results show that SG-LKF achieves top performance on KITTI 2D MOT and KITTI 3D MOT datasets, as well as outperforming SimpleTrack on nuScenes 3D MOT. The proposed approach significantly improves tracking performance in highly dynamic scenarios by dynamically adapting uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed. <div>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction, behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.

<div> Keywords: collaborative perception, spatio-temporal space, feature fusion, efficiency, accuracy

Summary: 
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) is introduced as an efficient approach for aggregating observations from multiple agents and different time instances into a unified spatio-temporal space simultaneously. By integrating multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation, CoST offers benefits of efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. This new method eliminates the need for re-transmitting object features multiple times, as each static object only requires transmission once in the spatial-temporal space. The holistic perspective provided by the unified space enhances perception performance in challenging scenarios. CoST is compatible with various existing methods and enhances their accuracy while reducing transmission bandwidth. Overall, CoST improves efficiency and accuracy in collaborative perception tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for hyperspectral instance-based classification.

<div> Neural implicit reconstruction, sparse views, feature consistency, uncertainty-guided depth constraint, high-quality geometry<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
SparseRecon is a new neural implicit reconstruction method designed for reconstructing 3D shapes or scenes from sparse RGB images. The method addresses issues faced by current methods, such as poor generalization and limited reconstruction quality due to insufficient geometry clues. SparseRecon utilizes a volume rendering-based feature consistency approach to ensure completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Additionally, an uncertainty-guided depth constraint is employed to recover geometry details in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, leading to improved reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseRecon outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with small overlapping views. The method's project page provides further information and demonstrates the superiority of SparseRecon in producing high-quality geometry from sparse-view inputs. <div>
arXiv:2508.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint. Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with small overlapping views.

<div> Keywords: Transformers, self-attention, token compression, FlashAttention, Representation Shift

Summary: 
Representation Shift introduces a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the extent of change in a token's representation. This metric seamlessly integrates token compression techniques with FlashAttention, a fused attention kernel that reduces memory overhead by eliminating the need for attention map construction. The method is applicable to Transformers, CNNs, and state space models, enabling effective token compression without attention maps or retraining. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA tasks, respectively. The proposed approach provides a solution to the increasing computation cost of self-attention in complex tasks, offering a practical method to enhance efficiency in various models. The code implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

Summary:
BiAnt is a new method for video-based long-term action anticipation that improves performance by combining forward and backward prediction using a large language model.

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature. These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model. Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Summary: <br />
Spatial transcriptomics enables precision oncology by revealing gene expression patterns in tissue context. Predicting spatial gene expression from histopathology images is a cost-effective alternative, but current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology using Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones fall short of clinical standards. To address this, a new hybrid backbone architecture, $MV_{Hybrid}$, combining state space models with ViT is proposed. Pretrained on colorectal cancer datasets using self-supervised learning, $MV_{Hybrid}$ outperforms ViT in gene expression prediction, showing superior performance and robustness. It also exhibits promising results in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks, positioning it as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. The code for $MV_{Hybrid}$ is publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a collaborative multi-agent system, Cued-Agent, for Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR). The system integrates four specialized sub-agents to decode hand movements and lip features, dynamically integrate hand prompts with lip features, and enable post-processing for phoneme-to-word conversion. The system was tested on a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects, including both normal and hearing-impaired cuers. Experimental results show that Cued-Agent outperforms existing methods in both scenarios. The implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration. This work addresses the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements in CS communication, leveraging multi-agent systems and expanding the Mandarin CS dataset for better training and evaluation. The proposed collaborative approach shows promising capabilities for effective ACSR in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces DAPT, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to address information asymmetry issues in vision-language models. By decoupling the visual modality into foreground and background representations and aligning them with corresponding textual prompts, DAPT ensures unbiased attention and strengthens modal alignment. Additionally, a visual pull-push regularization mechanism is proposed to enhance visual concentration on the region-of-interest object. The effectiveness of DAPT is demonstrated through improved performance in few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning tasks across various benchmarks. The DAPT framework is architecture-free and outperforms existing methods in enhancing task-specific transferability of vision-language models. The code for implementing DAPT is available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>
arXiv:2508.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm, has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality. Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the visual modality into the foreground and background representation via exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns, directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Summary: 
Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown success in diverse video understanding tasks, but their performance in industrial environments, where recognizing routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is crucial, is limited. To address this gap, a new benchmark called iSafetyBench has been introduced, specifically designed for evaluating model performance in industrial settings. The benchmark consists of 1,100 video clips from real-world industrial contexts, annotated with action tags covering routine and hazardous actions. Multiple-choice questions are provided for evaluating single-label and multi-label scenarios, revealing performance gaps in existing VLMs, particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label contexts. This highlights the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. The iSafetyBench dataset is available for further research and development in this area.

To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/iSafety-Bench.

<div> Keywords: dynamic efficiency index, turbulence, video restoration, optical flow, physical model-driven multi-stage

Summary:
The article introduces a Dynamic Efficiency Index (DEI) to quantify video dynamic intensity in varying turbulence conditions and creates a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. A Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration (PMR) framework is proposed, consisting of de-tilting for geometric stabilization, motion segmentation enhancement for dynamic region refinement, and de-blurring for quality restoration. PMR utilizes lightweight backbones and stage-wise joint training for efficiency and high restoration quality. Experimental results show effective suppression of motion trailing artifacts, restoration of edge details, and strong generalization capability in real-world scenarios with high-turbulence and complex dynamics. Code and datasets will be openly available.

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization, \textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and \textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code and datasets openly available.

Sortblock is a training-free inference acceleration framework designed to improve the efficiency of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by dynamically caching block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock can determine a recomputation ratio, allowing for the selective skipping of redundant computations while maintaining generation quality. Additionally, Sortblock incorporates a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks. Experimental results across various tasks and DiT architectures show that Sortblock can achieve over 2x inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality.

arXiv:2508.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders designed for high-resolution diffusion models. It addresses the issue of slow convergence in diffusion models when increasing the latent channel number, which can lead to a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality. DC-AE 1.5 introduces two key innovations to overcome this challenge: Structured Latent Space, which imposes a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space for better object structure and image detail capture, and Augmented Diffusion Training, a strategy that enhances convergence by adding diffusion training objectives on object latent channels. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 achieves faster convergence and improved diffusion scaling results compared to its predecessor, DC-AE. In experiments on ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE 1.5 outperforms DC-AE in image generation quality while also being four times faster. <div>

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-Gen.

<div> object flow learning, video outpainting, inpainting models, discriminator designs, adversarial training

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for enhancing video outpainting by utilizing object flow learning from inpainting models. The traditional fine-tuning approach for inpainting models in outpainting tasks often results in blurry outputs. The key improvement proposed is the use of a hierarchical discriminator that focuses on both global and local objectives in assessing outpainted areas. A specialized outpainting loss function leverages features from the discriminator to enhance the generator's ability to create visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. The supplementary materials, including a demo video and code, are available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

<div> Mamba, Underwater Instance Segmentation, Dynamic Tree Scan, Hidden State Weaken, UIS-Mamba <br />
Summary:
Mamba is a state space model that can be adapted for underwater instance segmentation. A new model, UIS-Mamba, is proposed with innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), designed to address challenges in underwater scene segmentation. The DTS module maintains internal feature continuity by dynamically offsetting and scaling patches, while the HSW module suppresses complex background interference. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on UIIS and USIS10K datasets with low parameters and computational complexity. The code for UIS-Mamba is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Maricalce/UIS-Mamba. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However, due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity.

<div> Keywords: amodal completion, human-object interactions, physical prior knowledge, multi-regional inpainting, diffusion model

Summary: <br /><br />Researchers have introduced a novel approach to improve amodal completion in dynamic human-object interaction scenarios. By leveraging physical prior knowledge and a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique, the model identifies primary and secondary regions for occlusion handling. Customized denoising strategies are applied within a diffusion model to enhance completion accuracy and realism in shape and detail. The proposed method surpasses existing techniques in generating plausible completions, advancing machine perception towards human-like understanding of dynamic environments. Moreover, the approach demonstrates robustness even without ground-truth contact annotations, extending its utility to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis. <div>
arXiv:2508.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Summary:
A new approach is proposed for addressing challenges in training machine learning models for aerial inspection of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants using drones. A synthetic dataset called AerialCSP is introduced to simulate real-world conditions and facilitate model pretraining. The dataset provides annotated data for object detection and image segmentation tasks, and multiple models are benchmarked on AerialCSP to establish a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks. Pretraining on AerialCSP is shown to improve real-world fault detection, especially for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. The AerialCSP dataset is made publicly available, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at https://mpcutino.github.io/aerialcsp/.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications, such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS models.

Summary: 
Recent advances in interactive matting have been successful in capturing main object regions but struggle with fine details in edge regions. This study introduces SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model. It leverages diffusion models' data distribution modeling and text-driven interaction capabilities to enable interactive matting. By incorporating visual prompts and opacity embeddings into a U-Net architecture, SDMatte improves sensitivity to spatial and opacity information. Additionally, a masked self-attention mechanism focuses the model on specified areas, enhancing performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm the effectiveness of SDMatte in interactive matting tasks. The code and model for SDMatte are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information. Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Summary:
AutoDebias is a novel framework designed to automatically detect and mitigate social biases present in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. It addresses both subtle and overlapping biases, which existing methods struggle with. The framework leverages vision-language models to identify biased visual patterns and create fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts. These guides drive a training process guided by CLIP, resulting in fairer outputs while maintaining image quality and diversity. In evaluations covering over 25 bias scenarios, AutoDebias achieved a 91.6% accuracy in detecting harmful patterns and reduced biased outputs significantly. The framework successfully tackled challenging cases involving multiple interacting biases, effectively lowering biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes, even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods, AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25 bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the visual fidelity of the original model.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research. Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<title>LAMIC: Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition via Scalability of Multimodal Diffusion Transformer</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00477</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2) Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale accordingly. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/LAMIC.

Abstract: We present SAMSA 2.0, an interactive segmentation framework for hyperspectral medical imaging that introduces spectral angle prompting to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) using spectral similarity alongside spatial cues. This early fusion of spectral information enables more accurate and robust segmentation across diverse spectral datasets. Without retraining, SAMSA 2.0 achieves up to +3.8% higher Dice scores compared to RGB-only models and up to +3.1% over prior spectral fusion methods. Our approach enhances few-shot and zero-shot performance, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging low-data and noisy scenarios common in clinical imaging.

<title>LesiOnTime -- Joint Temporal and Clinical Modeling for Small Breast Lesion Segmentation in Longitudinal DCE-MRI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00496</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation, they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening, detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans; and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5% in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening.

<title>Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool</title>

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space.

<title>Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Grounding on Egocentric Videos</title>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/EgoMask .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network (EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed, while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<title>Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc. Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

<title>Your other Left! Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset, designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative positions in medical images.

arXiv:2508.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising, severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time adversarial purification.

<title>HiPrune: Training-Free Visual Token Pruning via Hierarchical Attention in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00553</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue, they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3% tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Danielement321/HiPrune.

<title>Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs. Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects. We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited.

<title>CoProU-VO: Combining Projected Uncertainty for End-to-End Unsupervised Monocular Visual Odometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language. Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval, when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

<title>A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias. Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/JiajunLe/GeoMoE.

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment. This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.

<title>Revisiting Adversarial Patch Defenses on Object Detectors: Unified Evaluation, Large-Scale Dataset, and New Insights</title>

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new attacks/defenses.

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our approach.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

<title>MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the 'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

<title>Rethinking Backbone Design for Lightweight 3D Object Detection in LiDAR</title>

arXiv:2508.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

arXiv:2508.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g., left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2% faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively. Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature learning.

<title>Is It Really You? Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos</title>

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

arXiv:2508.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures, creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data, which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS, an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration, standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers alike.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers, and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics.

<title>Towards Higher Effective Rank in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning using Khatri--Rao Product</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.

<title>Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior</title>

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

<title>UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents</title>

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality, marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan, a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion, producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be found at https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/omni-scan/

<title>CoRGI: Verified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module (VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

<title>STF: Shallow-Level Temporal Feedback to Enhance Spiking Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation</title>

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts, leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a `stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions. To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow, ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving 2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However, when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16 publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound, the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-based person retrieval seeks to retrieve images of a target person using textual descriptions, without relying on identity annotations and is more challenging and practical. The primary challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP model to weakly supervised text-based person retrieval to map visual and textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of weakly supervised text-based person retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, generalizability of CPCL.

Abstract: We introduce Gaga, a framework that reconstructs and segments open-world 3D scenes by leveraging inconsistent 2D masks predicted by zero-shot class-agnostic segmentation models. Contrasted to prior 3D scene segmentation approaches that rely on video object tracking or contrastive learning methods, Gaga utilizes spatial information and effectively associates object masks across diverse camera poses through a novel 3D-aware memory bank. By eliminating the assumption of continuous view changes in training images, Gaga demonstrates robustness to variations in camera poses, particularly beneficial for sparsely sampled images, ensuring precise mask label consistency. Furthermore, Gaga accommodates 2D segmentation masks from diverse sources and demonstrates robust performance with different open-world zero-shot class-agnostic segmentation models, significantly enhancing its versatility. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Gaga performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing its potential for real-world applications such as 3D scene understanding and manipulation.

Abstract: Transfer-based attacks craft adversarial examples on white-box surrogate models and directly deploy them against black-box target models, offering model-agnostic and query-free threat scenarios. While flatness-enhanced methods have recently emerged to improve transferability by enhancing the loss surface flatness of adversarial examples, their divergent flatness definitions and heuristic attack designs suffer from unexamined optimization limitations and missing theoretical foundation, thus constraining their effectiveness and efficiency. This work exposes the severely imbalanced exploitation-exploration dynamics in flatness optimization, establishing the first theoretical foundation for flatness-based transferability and proposing a principled framework to overcome these optimization pitfalls. Specifically, we systematically unify fragmented flatness definitions across existing methods, revealing their imbalanced optimization limitations in over-exploration of sensitivity peaks or over-exploitation of local plateaus. To resolve these issues, we rigorously formalize average-case flatness and transferability gaps, proving that enhancing zeroth-order average-case flatness minimizes cross-model discrepancies. Building on this theory, we design a Maximin Expected Flatness (MEF) attack that enhances zeroth-order average-case flatness while balancing flatness exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations across 22 models and 24 current transfer-based attacks demonstrate MEF's superiority: it surpasses the state-of-the-art PGN attack by 4% in attack success rate at half the computational cost and achieves 8% higher success rate under the same budget. When combined with input augmentation, MEF attains 15% additional gains against defense-equipped models, establishing new robustness benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-aspect multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging is a critical remote sensing technique, promising in urban mapping and monitoring. However, sparse observation due to constrained flight trajectories degrade imaging quality, particularly for anisotropic small targets like vehicles and aircraft. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR reconstruction. More recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, markedly boosting reconstruction quality and efficiency through strong data-driven representations capabilities and fast inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods typically train deep neural networks (DNNs) using only high-resolution radar images. This unimodal learning paradigm precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in reconstruction performance. In this paper, we introduce cross-modal learning and propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances sparse 3D SAR reconstruction by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error propagation guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Trained solely on simulated data, CMAR-Net exhibits strong generalization across extensive real-world evaluations on parking lot measurements containing numerous civilian vehicles, outperforming state-of-the-art CS and DL methods in structural accuracy. Our work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for 3D SAR reconstruction and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation agents can enhance user experience in communication, entertainment, and productivity by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we present GUIOdyssey, a comprehensive dataset for cross-app mobile GUI navigation. GUIOdyssey comprises 8,334 episodes with an average of 15.3 steps per episode, covering 6 mobile devices, 212 distinct apps, and 1,357 app combinations. Each step is enriched with detailed semantic reasoning annotations, which aid the model in building cognitive processes and enhancing its reasoning abilities for complex cross-app tasks. Building on GUIOdyssey, we develop OdysseyAgent, an exploratory multimodal agent for long-step cross-app navigation equipped with a history resampler module that efficiently attends to historical screenshot tokens, balancing performance and inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that historial information involving actions, screenshots and context in our dataset can significantly enhances OdysseyAgent's performance on complex cross-app tasks.

<title>A Physical Model-Guided Framework for Underwater Image Enhancement and Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: Due to the selective absorption and scattering of light by diverse aquatic media, underwater images usually suffer from various visual degradations. Existing underwater image enhancement (UIE) approaches that combine underwater physical imaging models with neural networks often fail to accurately estimate imaging model parameters such as depth and veiling light, resulting in poor performance in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a physical model-guided framework for jointly training a Deep Degradation Model (DDM) with any advanced UIE model. DDM includes three well-designed sub-networks to accurately estimate various imaging parameters: a veiling light estimation sub-network, a factors estimation sub-network, and a depth estimation sub-network. Based on the estimated parameters and the underwater physical imaging model, we impose physical constraints on the enhancement process by modeling the relationship between underwater images and desired clean images, i.e., outputs of the UIE model. Moreover, while our framework is compatible with any UIE model, we design a simple yet effective fully convolutional UIE model, termed UIEConv. UIEConv utilizes both global and local features for image enhancement through a dual-branch structure. UIEConv trained within our framework achieves remarkable enhancement results across diverse underwater scenes. Furthermore, as a byproduct of UIE, the trained depth estimation sub-network enables accurate underwater scene depth estimation. Extensive experiments conducted in various real underwater imaging scenarios, including deep-sea environments with artificial light sources, validate the effectiveness of our framework and the UIEConv model.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) typically necessitates extensive computational costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract multi-modal representations. In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn from multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the inference phase? To answer it, we propose \textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal 3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point cloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point clouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once. Leveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point cloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the need for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core components: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric constraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and text encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud information with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud encoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association between trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched associations with similar representations but significant positional discrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any scene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric constraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated by a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements into a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce AttnMod, a training-free technique that modulates cross-attention in pre-trained diffusion models to generate novel, unpromptable art styles. The method is inspired by how a human artist might reinterpret a generated image, for example by emphasizing certain features, dispersing color, twisting silhouettes, or materializing unseen elements. AttnMod simulates this intent by altering how the text prompt conditions the image through attention during denoising. These targeted modulations enable diverse stylistic transformations without changing the prompt or retraining the model, and they expand the expressive capacity of text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous changes, have gained significant attention for their potential in feature tracking, especially in challenging conditions. However, event cameras lack the fine-grained texture information that conventional cameras provide, leading to error accumulation in tracking. To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with grayscale images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking and effectively solves the data association and fusion from asynchronous event and image data. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing methods, exceeding 80 FPS with multi-modality data and 100 FPS with preprocessed event data. Codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/ColieShen/BlinkTrack.

To address this, we propose an alternative approach by creating a high-quality synthetic dataset specifically for video instruction-following, namely LLaVA-Video-178K. This dataset includes key tasks such as detailed captioning, open-ended question-answering (QA), and multiple-choice QA. By training on this dataset, in combination with existing visual instruction tuning data, we introduce LLaVA-Video, a new video LMM. Our experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-Video achieves strong performance across various video benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset. We plan to release the dataset, its generation pipeline, and the model checkpoints.

Abstract: We propose Long-LRM, a feed-forward 3D Gaussian reconstruction model for instant, high-resolution, 360{\deg} wide-coverage, scene-level reconstruction. Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&amp;Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

<title>ShadowMamba: State-Space Model with Boundary-Region Selective Scan for Shadow Removal</title>

Abstract: Image shadow removal is a common low-level vision problem. Shadows cause sudden brightness changes in some areas, which can affect the accuracy of downstream tasks. Currently, Transformer-based shadow removal methods improve computational efficiency by using a window mechanism. However, this approach reduces the effective receptive field and weakens the ability to model long-range dependencies in shadow images. Recently, Mamba has achieved significant success in computer vision by modeling long-sequence information globally with linear complexity. However, when applied to shadow removal, its original scanning mechanism overlooks the semantic continuity along shadow boundaries, and the coherence within each region. To solve this issue, we propose a new boundary-region selective scanning mechanism that scans shadow, boundary, and non-shadow regions separately, making pixels of the same type closer in the sequence. This increases semantic continuity and helps the model understand local details better. Incorporating this idea, we design the first Mamba-based lightweight shadow removal model, called ShadowMamba. It uses a hierarchical combination U-Net structure, which effectively reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity. Shallow layers rely on our boundary-region selective scanning to capture local details, while deeper layers use global cross-scanning to learn global brightness features. Extensive experiments show that ShadowMamba outperforms current state-of-the-art models on ISTD+, ISTD, and SRD datasets, and it also requires fewer parameters and less computational cost. (Code will be made available upon paper acceptance.)

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.

Abstract: Panoramic Image Generation (PIG) aims to create coherent images of arbitrary lengths. Most existing methods fall in the joint diffusion paradigm, but their complex and heuristic crop connection designs often limit their ability to achieve multilevel coherence. By deconstructing this challenge into its core components, we find it naturally aligns with next-token prediction, leading us to adopt an autoregressive (AR) paradigm for PIG modeling. However, existing visual AR (VAR) models are limited to fixed-size generation, lacking the capability to produce panoramic images. In this paper, we propose PanoLlama, a novel framework that achieves endless and coherent panorama generation with the autoregressive paradigm. Our approach develops a training-free strategy that utilizes token redirection to overcome the size limitations of existing VAR models, enabling next-crop prediction in both horizontal and vertical directions. This refreshes the PIG pipeline while achieving SOTA performance in coherence (47.50%), fidelity(28.16%), and aesthetics (15%). Additionally, PanoLlama supports applications other PIG methods cannot achieve, including mask-free layout control, multi-scale and multi-guidance synthesis. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we also establish a dataset with 1,000 prompts spanning 100+ themes, providing a new testing benchmark for PIG research. The code is available at https://github.com/0606zt/PanoLlama.

Abstract: Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. Although powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyperparameters that govern the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop parametric and nonparametric strategies to enhance synthetic images in a way that improves the performance of the segmentation network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy on synthetic and real-world brain scans. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models. Code and models are available on https://MiraPurkrabek.github.io/BBox-Mask-Pose.

Abstract: Although open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong zero-shot learning capabilities, their robustness to common image corruptions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose $\texttt{BATCLIP}$, a bimodal $\textbf{online}$ TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed TTA approach on various domain generalization datasets to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce NoiseQuery as a novel method for enhanced noise initialization in versatile goal-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models achieve strong performance across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model. Surprisingly, we find that while strong performance is maintained across many tasks, it exhibits drastically different behavior for a subset of vision-centric tasks such as localization. Upon further investigation, we uncover a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, on many benchmarks aiming to evaluate vision-centric capabilities, strong performance persists with the flawed pruning strategy, highlighting these benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Based on these findings, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that resolves the discovered early-layer pruning issue and further enhances the preservation of relevant tokens via multistage pruning with early uniform sampling to ensure broad image coverage. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER achieves more than 5x performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.

Abstract: We present FaceLift, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable high-quality 360-degree 3D head reconstruction from a single image. Our pipeline first employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to generate consistent side and back views from a single facial input, which then feeds into a transformer-based reconstructor that produces a comprehensive 3D Gaussian splats representation. Previous methods for monocular 3D face reconstruction often lack full view coverage or view consistency due to insufficient multi-view supervision. We address this by creating a high-quality synthetic head dataset that enables consistent supervision across viewpoints. To bridge the domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world images, we propose a simple yet effective technique that ensures the view generation process maintains fidelity to the input by learning to reconstruct the input image alongside the view generation. Despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction methods on identity preservation, detail recovery, and rendering quality.

However, their ability to deeply understand the unique physical properties of non-RGB vision sensor images remains limited. In this paper, we revisit and analyze these limitations and introduce a novel, cost-efficient paradigm that significantly advances sensor image understanding-without requiring extensive training data or any modifications to the existing VLM architectures. Specifically, we propose Sensor-Aware Attributes Fine-Tuning (SAFT) with the Diverse Negative Attributes (DNA) optimization, which leverages minimal sensor-specific data to enable robust learning of non-RGB characteristics and overcome RGB-centric biases inherent in current VLMs. In addition, we present VS-TDX-the first comprehensive, public benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs' sensor-specific understanding across diverse and realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments on VLMs and various sensor modalities, we validate that our method consistently delivers superior performance and generalization under resource-constrained and architecture-invariant settings. Our approach provides a practical advance towards scalable deployment of VLMs in increasingly sensor-diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Generative videos have the potential to revolutionize game development by autonomously creating new content. In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, an action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing an action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

<title>Multi-Cali Anything: Dense Feature Multi-Frame Structure-from-Motion for Large-Scale Camera Array Calibration</title>

Abstract: Calibrating large-scale camera arrays, such as those in dome-based setups, is time-intensive and typically requires dedicated captures of known patterns. While extrinsics in such arrays are fixed due to the physical setup, intrinsics often vary across sessions due to factors like lens adjustments or temperature changes. In this paper, we propose a dense-feature-driven multi-frame calibration method that refines intrinsics directly from scene data, eliminating the necessity for additional calibration captures. Our approach enhances traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines by introducing an extrinsics regularization term to progressively align estimated extrinsics with ground-truth values, a dense feature reprojection term to reduce keypoint errors by minimizing reprojection loss in the feature space, and an intrinsics variance term for joint optimization across multiple frames. Experiments on the Multiface dataset show that our method achieves nearly the same precision as dedicated calibration processes, and significantly enhances intrinsics and 3D reconstruction accuracy. Fully compatible with existing SfM pipelines, our method provides an efficient and practical plug-and-play solution for large-scale camera setups.

Abstract: Multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) synthesizes multiple, differently exposed images of the same scene into a single, well-exposed composite. Retinex theory, which separates image illumination from scene reflectance, provides a natural framework to ensure consistent scene representation and effective information fusion across varied exposure levels. However, the conventional pixel-wise multiplication of illumination and reflectance inadequately models the glare effect induced by overexposure. To address this limitation, we introduce an unsupervised and controllable method termed Retinex-MEF. Specifically, our method decomposes multi-exposure images into separate illumination components with a shared reflectance component, and effectively models the glare induced by overexposure. The shared reflectance is learned via a bidirectional loss, which enables our approach to effectively mitigate the glare effect. Furthermore, we introduce a controllable exposure fusion criterion, enabling global exposure adjustments while preserving contrast, thus overcoming the constraints of a fixed exposure level. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including underexposure-overexposure fusion, exposure controlled fusion, and homogeneous extreme exposure fusion, demonstrate the effective decomposition and flexible fusion capability of our model.

Abstract: Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research. Codes, datasets and models are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/Copernicus-FM.

Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. Our approach advances event-data denoising theory and expands practical denoising use-cases via open-source code. Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/ESMD

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of identity documents (IDs) has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, there are no publicly available data from real IDs for proper research in this area, and most published studies rely on proprietary internal databases that are not available for privacy reasons. In order to advance this critical challenge of real data scarcity that makes it so difficult to advance the technology of machine learning-based fake ID detection, we introduce a new patch-based methodology that trades off privacy and performance, and propose a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-aware fake ID detection: FakeIDet. In our experiments, we explore: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. State-of-the-art methods, such as vision transformers and foundation models, are considered as backbones. Our results show that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal for fake ID detection achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at the patch and the whole ID level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to the path-based methodology introduced and the new FakeIDet method based on it, another key contribution of our article is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from real and fake IDs, called FakeIDet-db, together with the experimental framework.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of remotely sensed data and the potential of such data to inform large-scale decision-making has driven the development of deep learning models for many Earth Observation tasks. Traditionally, such models must be trained on large datasets. However, the common assumption that broadly larger datasets lead to better outcomes tends to overlook the complexities of the data distribution, the potential for introducing biases and noise, and the computational resources required for processing and storing vast datasets. Therefore, effective solutions should consider both the quantity and quality of data. In this paper, we propose six novel core-set selection methods for selecting important subsets of samples from remote sensing image segmentation datasets that rely on imagery only, labels only, and a combination of each. We benchmark these approaches against a random-selection baseline on three commonly used land cover classification datasets: DFC2022, Vaihingen, and Potsdam. In each of the datasets, we demonstrate that training on a subset of samples outperforms the random baseline, and some approaches outperform training on all available data. This result shows the importance and potential of data-centric learning for the remote sensing domain. The code is available at https://github.com/keillernogueira/data-centric-rs-classification/.

Abstract: Reconstructing a high-quality, animatable 3D human avatar with expressive facial and hand motions from a single image has gained significant attention due to its broad application potential. 3D human avatar reconstruction typically requires multi-view or monocular videos and training on individual IDs, which is both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's expressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with facial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an expressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and develop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose GUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling techniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The rendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering quality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in the sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.

Abstract: Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset, which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD), which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics, thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility.
  Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Urdu newspapers, addressing challenges posed by complex multi-column layouts, low-resolution scans, and the stylistic variability of the Nastaliq script. Our system comprises four modules: (1) article segmentation, (2) image super-resolution, (3) column segmentation, and (4) text recognition. We fine-tune YOLOv11x for segmentation, achieving 0.963 precision for articles and 0.970 for columns. A SwinIR-based super-resolution model boosts LLM text recognition accuracy by 25-70%. We also introduce the Urdu Newspaper Benchmark (UNB), a manually annotated dataset for Urdu OCR. Using UNB and the OpenITI corpus, we compare traditional CNN+RNN-based OCR models with modern LLMs. Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best performance with a WER of 0.133. We further analyze LLM outputs via insertion, deletion, and substitution error breakdowns, as well as character-level confusion analysis. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on just 500 samples yields a 6.13% WER improvement, highlighting the adaptability of LLMs for Urdu OCR.

Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the standard architecture in computer vision, their massive sizes lead to significant computational overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss, requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds, thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30% reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their original accuracy.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.

Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects, distinguishing them from ordinary edges and semantic contours to support more accurate scene understanding. This task is closely related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single image, as Occlusion Boundaries (OBs) provide critical geometric cues for resolving depth ambiguities, while depth can conversely refine occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we propose MoDOT, a novel method that jointly estimates depth and OBs from a single image for the first time. MoDOT incorporates a new module, CASM, which combines cross-attention and multi-scale strip convolutions to leverage mid-level OB features for improved depth prediction. It also includes an occlusion-aware loss, OBDCL, which encourages more accurate boundaries in the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OBs, and validate the effectiveness of MoDOT's design. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two synthetic datasets and the widely used NYUD-v2 real-world dataset, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Furthermore, the cross-domain results of MoDOT on real-world depth prediction - trained solely on our synthetic dataset - yield promising results, preserving sharp OBs in the predicted depth maps and demonstrating improved geometric fidelity compared to competitors. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and dataset at [link].

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Depth estimation is crucial for intelligent systems, enabling applications from autonomous navigation to augmented reality. While traditional stereo and active depth sensors have limitations in cost, power, and robustness, dual-pixel (DP) technology, ubiquitous in modern cameras, offers a compelling alternative. This paper introduces DiFuse-Net, a novel modality decoupled network design for disentangled RGB and DP based depth estimation. DiFuse-Net features a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) specifically designed to capture the subtle DP disparity cues unique to smartphone cameras with small aperture. A separate encoder extracts contextual information from the RGB image, and these features are fused to enhance depth prediction. We also propose a Cross-modal Transfer Learning (CmTL) mechanism to utilize large-scale RGB-D datasets in the literature to cope with the limitations of obtaining large-scale RGB-DP-D dataset. Our evaluation and comparison of the proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the DP and stereo-based baseline methods. Additionally, we contribute a new, high-quality, real-world RGB-DP-D training dataset, named Dual-Camera Dual-Pixel (DCDP) dataset, created using our novel symmetric stereo camera hardware setup, stereo calibration and rectification protocol, and AI stereo disparity estimation method.

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code are publicly available at https://bxiang233.github.io/FF3D/.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of the complete canopy architecture are essential for accurately evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield performance to guide ideotype design. Although various sensing technologies have been developed for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of individual plants and canopies, they failed to obtain an accurate description of canopy architectures due to severe occlusion among complex canopy architectures. We proposed an effective method for 3D reconstruction of complex, dynamic population canopy architecture for rapeseed crops with a novel point cloud completion model. A complete point cloud generation framework was developed for automated annotation of the training dataset by distinguishing surface points from occluded points within canopies. The crop population point cloud completion network (CP-PCN) was then designed with a multi-resolution dynamic graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and a point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict occluded points. To further enhance feature extraction, a dynamic graph convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) module was proposed to capture structural variations over the whole rapeseed growth period. The results demonstrated that CP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm -4.51 cm over four growth stages, outperforming the state-of-the-art transformer-based method (PoinTr). Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE modules. Moreover, the validation experiment demonstrated that the silique efficiency index developed from CP-PCN improved the overall accuracy of rapeseed yield prediction by 11.2% compared to that of using incomplete point clouds. The CP-PCN pipeline has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly advancing the quantitatively analysis of in-field population canopy architectures.

Abstract: Although interpretable prototype networks have improved the transparency of deep learning image classification, the need for multiple prototypes in collaborative decision-making increases cognitive complexity and hinders user understanding. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel interpretable deep architecture for image classification, called ProtoSolo. Unlike existing prototypical networks, ProtoSolo requires activation of only a single prototype to complete the classification. This design significantly simplifies interpretation, as the explanation for each class requires displaying only the prototype with the highest similarity score and its corresponding feature map. Additionally, the traditional full-channel feature vector is replaced with a feature map for similarity comparison and prototype learning, enabling the use of richer global information within a single-prototype activation decision. A non-projection prototype learning strategy is also introduced to preserve the association between the prototype and image patch while avoiding abrupt structural changes in the network caused by projection, which can affect classification performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that ProtoSolo matches state-of-the-art interpretable methods in classification accuracy while achieving the lowest cognitive complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/pyt19/ProtoSolo.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning (CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-instance feature association constitutes a crucial step in 3D reconstruction, facilitating the consistent grouping of object instances across various camera perspectives. The presence of multiple identical objects within a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching algorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing geometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature association. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm designed for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of noisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature points from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the same 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true associations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can result in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance is less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient. This process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes. Furthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an Inter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based baseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding conditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features, and restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for scalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.

<title>Rethinking Pan-sharpening: Principled Design, Unified Training, and a Universal Loss Surpass Brute-Force Scaling</title>

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets. This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper. In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance. More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for pan-sharpening.

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored, high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models, rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase, one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is available at https://github.com/pq-chen/CasP.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving machine learning approach where private data remains local, enabling secure computations and the exchange of local model gradients between local clients and third-party parameter servers. However, recent findings reveal that privacy may be compromised and sensitive information potentially recovered from shared gradients. In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with many models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method for large pre-trained models, offering strong in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Breaking away from traditional practices that need a multitude of fine-tuned models for averaging, our approach employs significantly fewer models to achieve final weights yet yield superior accuracy. Drawing from key insights in the weight space of fine-tuned weights, we uncover a strong link between the performance and proximity to the center of weight space. Based on this, we introduce a method that approximates a center-close weight using only two fine-tuned models, applicable during or after training. Our innovative layer-wise weight averaging technique surpasses state-of-the-art model methods such as Model Soup, utilizing only two fine-tuned models. This strategy can be aptly coined Model Stock, highlighting its reliance on selecting a minimal number of models to draw a more optimized-averaged model. We demonstrate the efficacy of Model Stock with fine-tuned models based upon pre-trained CLIP architectures, achieving remarkable performance on both ID and OOD tasks on the standard benchmarks, all while barely bringing extra computational demands. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/model-stock.

Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting a meaningful global descriptor from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the database point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TopoRec, which utilizes Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for extracting local descriptors from a point cloud, thereby eliminating the need for resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. To test the quality of the proposed TopoRec technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, NCLT) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for large-scale place and object recognition, respectively. Unlike existing learning-based approaches such as PointNetVLAD and PCAN, our method does not require extensive training, making it easily adaptable to new environments. Despite this, it consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art learning-based and handcrafted baselines (e.g., M2DP, ScanContext) on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and strong generalization.

Abstract: Zero-shot depth estimation (DE) models exhibit strong generalization performance as they are trained on large-scale datasets. However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data. Zero-shot evaluations on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes demonstrate that our PRO can be seamlessly integrated into existing depth estimation models.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic 4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core, MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior 4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems, and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation, allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR) techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs. Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet, which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

Summary: 
The article introduces a spike-based NeRF framework called Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA) that utilizes spiking neural networks for efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. By dynamically adjusting time steps during training, the model can optimize rendering quality while reducing computational resources during inference. This approach allows for scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps, leading to a 64% reduction in inference time steps and a 61.55% decrease in running power consumption. The method is evaluated across diverse datasets and demonstrates promising results in maintaining rendering fidelity while improving efficiency in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. <div>
arXiv:2507.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous vehicles, NovaDrive, vision-language architecture, real-time inference, safety

Summary:
Autonomous vehicles face the challenge of quick decision-making while navigating complex environments. NovaDrive, a vision-language architecture, combines front-camera images, HD map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. It utilizes a two-stage cross-attention block to align waypoint tokens with the HD map and refine attention over image and depth patches, eliminating the need for recurrent memory. By fine-tuning top layers of a vision-language backbone, NovaDrive achieves real-time inference and improves success rate, path efficiency, and collision frequency on benchmark tests. Waypoint tokens, partial fine-tuning, and cross-attention fusion are key contributors to these performance gains. Additionally, the implementation of a smoothness loss results in shorter routes and potential fuel or battery savings. NovaDrive's advancements not only enhance safety but also pave the way for leaner and more easily updatable driving systems. This architecture holds promise for extending its applications to other smart AI domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

<div> Keywords: synthetic data generation, autonomous driving, medical image analysis, multimodal object inpainting, reference-guided inpainting

Summary: 
The article introduces two innovative synthetic data generation methods - MObI for autonomous driving and AnydoorMed for medical image analysis. MObI is a framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that utilizes a diffusion model to realistically insert objects into existing scenes for autonomous driving, ensuring semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. AnydoorMed extends this approach to medical imaging, focusing on inpainting anomalies in mammography scans while preserving structural integrity and blending with surrounding tissue. Both methods leverage reference guidance and 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate positioning and realistic scaling. These techniques demonstrate the adaptability of foundation models for reference-guided inpainting across diverse perceptual modalities, enabling the construction of highly realistic, controllable, and multimodal scenarios for safety-critical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

Summary:
XYZ-Drive is a vision-language model designed for autonomous driving that integrates geometric accuracy and semantic understanding. It utilizes a lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer to allow waypoint tokens to highlight relevant image and map patches, improving action and textual explanations. The model achieves high success rates and efficiency on the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark, surpassing previous approaches. Ablation studies confirm the importance of integrating vision, waypoint, and map modalities, as well as the effectiveness of goal-centered attention for map knowledge fusion. Fine-tuning the transformer is crucial for task-specific performance improvement, with frozen models showing reduced success. Additionally, maintaining high map resolution is essential for accurately detecting lane edges and reducing collision rates. Overall, XYZ-Drive demonstrates the efficacy of early, token-level fusion for enabling transparent, real-time autonomous driving.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

arXiv:2507.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species, car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem. Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method, Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.

<div> identity leakage, facial animation, zero-shot, diffusion-based, portrait

Summary:
X-NeMo is a new zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation system that can animate a static portrait using facial movements from a different individual in a driving video. The system addresses previous issues like identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions by using a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from the driving image. This descriptor controls motion through cross-attention during image generation, capturing expressive facial motion in fine detail. The system learns from a diverse video dataset without relying on pretrained motion detectors. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion through cross-attention, X-NeMo eliminates identity leakage. Supervision of learning with a dual GAN decoder further enhances expressiveness and disentangles motion latents from identity cues, resulting in highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. The code and models for X-NeMo are available for research.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail, learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models are available for research.

<div> neural inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, reflectance estimation, lighting conditions, multi-view images<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel neural inverse rendering approach that can reconstruct geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under different lighting directions. Unlike previous methods, this approach does not require light calibration or per-view normal maps. Instead, it jointly optimizes all scene parameters in a single stage using raw images. By representing geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and applying shadow-aware volume rendering, the proposed method achieves superior accuracy in shape and lighting estimation compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It also demonstrates robustness in handling objects with complex geometry and reflectance properties, as well as generalizes well to view-unaligned multi-light images. <div>

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality. However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion -- within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for advancing motion acquisition.

<div> adversarial image, diffusion model, multimodal large language models, adversarial-guided noise, defense<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach to generate adversarial images that deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) while minimizing distortion. Unlike traditional attacks, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of a diffusion model, ensuring attack efficacy. The full-spectrum property of the noise in AGD makes it robust to defenses that target specific frequency bands. By combining clean images with noise during reverse diffusion, AGD produces adversarial images that are challenging to suppress using common defenses. Experimental results demonstrate that AGD surpasses existing methods in attack performance and model robustness against certain defenses. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property. Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as in model robustness to some defenses.

Summary:
Our study focuses on food crystal agglomeration during crystallization, which can impact product quality. Manual identification in 2D microscopic images is challenging due to transparency and limited perspective. We propose a supervised model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels, followed by an instance classification model for pixel-wise segmentation. This approach combines classification and segmentation for improved accuracy and size distribution predictions. A post-processing module is included to preserve crystal properties. Our method successfully classifies potential agglomerated instances and is evaluated under two confidence levels for manual annotations. <div>

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated instances.

Summary:<br />
Road damage detection is crucial for traffic safety and infrastructure maintenance. Existing deep learning methods face challenges in accurately detecting small-scale damages and high computational demands. To address this, a new model called YOLO-ROC is proposed, combining a BMS-SPPF module for multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy for efficiency. YOLO-ROC achieved a mAP50 of 67.6% on the RDD2022_China_Drone dataset, surpassing YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Improvements were seen in detecting small targets, with a 16.8% increase in mAP50 for the D40 category. The model size was reduced to only 2.0 MB while maintaining high performance. YOLO-ROC also demonstrated strong generalization on the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets. Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from 3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of 67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only 2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Summary: 
Augmented reality (AR) is becoming more prevalent in daily life, emphasizing the need for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of virtual content. This research focuses on detecting task-detrimental AR content that hinders critical information or distorts user perception. Two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, were developed using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules to identify such attacks. The study proposes three future directions: automated evaluation of virtual content quality aligned with perception, detection of multimodal attacks, and optimization of VLMs for efficient deployment on AR devices. The overall goal is to establish a scalable framework that prioritizes human-centered protection of AR experiences. Feedback is sought on perceptual modeling, implementing multimodal AR content, and adapting lightweight models for user-centric deployment. <div>

Summary:<br />
Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to help models learn new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. The research on Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL) has introduced the concept of leveraging unlabeled samples to improve learning. However, existing approaches only consider unlabeled data from novel classes of the current session, limiting their practicality. To address this, Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) incorporates both base and novel classes in the unlabeled set. This new approach presents a challenge for existing methods in distinguishing between base and novel class samples. The proposed Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy dynamically corrects biased feature distributions using base samples for few-shot novel classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ALDC outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces RL-QR, a reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It aims to optimize queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents without the need for human-annotated datasets. By using scenario-question pairs and Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, showing significant performance improvements in industrial data experiments. RL-QR enhances retrieval performance for text-only and multi-modal databases, with a notable 11% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG with RL-QR_multi-modal. However, challenges still exist in semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance due to training misalignments. RL-QR shows promise in revolutionizing query optimization for RAG systems, offering an annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while also highlighting areas for further improvement in semantic retrieval contexts. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce \textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house data demonstrate significant improvements, with $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable, annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to creating a comprehensive atlas for mapping cranial nerve (CN) pathways in the human brain using diffusion MRI. By utilizing multi-parametric fiber tractography and a multi-stage fiber clustering strategy, the CN atlas accurately identifies 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs. Through quantitative and visual experiments on datasets from the Human Connectome Project, Multi-shell Diffusion MRI, and clinical cases, the atlas demonstrates high spatial correspondence with manual annotations. The automated mapping provided by this atlas enhances the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures, offering valuable insights into the spatial relationships between CNs and surrounding anatomy. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and detailed mapping of CN pathways, potentially aiding in preoperative planning and neurosurgical interventions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

<div> Keywords: Time Series forecasting, Geometric Structure Index, Shape-Aware Temporal Loss, first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss

Summary:
The study introduces a novel evaluation metric, the Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), to assess the geometric structure of time series data. To address the non-differentiability issue, a Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL) is proposed, comprising three components: first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss, and perceptual feature loss. The SATL aims to enhance structure modeling during training without increasing computational cost during inference. Experimental results on various datasets show that models trained with SATL outperform baseline methods in terms of both mean squared error (MSE) and TGSI metrics. The proposed method effectively leverages the inherent two-dimensional geometric representations of time series data, demonstrating its potential for improving forecasting accuracy across different domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of Geometric Structure Index (TGSI) for evaluating temporal dynamics.
- Proposal of Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL) to bridge the non-differentiability gap.
- SATL combines three components to enhance structure modeling during training.
- Experimental results show superior performance of SATL-trained models in MSE and TGSI compared to baselines.
- Potential for improved forecasting accuracy in diverse domains. <div>

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

<div> Keywords: Multi-label image recognition, partial labels, Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning, score distribution, performance improvement

Summary:
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm is proposed for Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL). SATL calculates score distributions for positive and negative samples in each category to dynamically determine category-specific thresholds. The thresholds are continuously updated during the learning process. A differential ranking loss is utilized to enhance discrimination between score distributions of positive and negative samples. The method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels, as demonstrated through experiments on large-scale multi-label datasets like Microsoft COCO and VG-200. This novel approach overcomes inaccuracies and incompleteness in pseudo-labels commonly caused by fixed thresholds based on semantic or feature correlations. The dynamic nature of SATL ensures more accurate and effective training with varying score distributions across categories. <div>

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets, such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

<div> Keywords: diffusion transformers, variational autoencoder, neural field, end-to-end solution, text-to-image

Summary:
PixelNerd introduces a novel approach to image generation by modeling patch-wise decoding using neural field representation. This single-scale, single-stage, end-to-end solution eliminates the need for complex cascade pipelines and variational autoencoders (VAEs), reducing errors and decoding artifacts. The efficient neural field representation in PixelNerd achieves impressive FID scores of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 on ImageNet 512x512. Additionally, the framework is extended to text-to-image applications, where PixNerd-XXL/16 performs competitively on both the GenEval and DPG benchmarks. This innovative approach opens the door for more efficient and effective image generation techniques without relying on traditional VAE-based methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE). However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems, researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale, single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16 achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9 overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Summary: 
- The study explores the use of SAM2 for low-cost and minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI.
- Three different slice-wise tracking strategies were tested, with center-outward propagation showing the best results in consistency and accuracy.
- Despite not being specifically trained for medical data, SAM2 demonstrated strong segmentation performance with minimal supervision.
- The analysis revealed how segmentation performance varies based on tumor size, location, and shape, highlighting key failure modes.
- The findings suggest that general-purpose foundation models like SAM2 can effectively support 3D medical image analysis in resource-constrained settings, providing an accessible and affordable alternative. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs, proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost, minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2 can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces the iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) for efficient 3D reconstruction using a decoupled scene representation approach.
- iLRM employs a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs and iteratively refines 3D Gaussian representations for high-fidelity reconstruction.

arXiv:2507.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces UniLIP, an extension of CLIP that enhances its capabilities in tasks such as reconstruction, generation, and editing. Previous methods relied on additional components like diffusion decoders or quantization, leading to inconsistent results. UniLIP adopts a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation to integrate reconstruction abilities without compromising comprehension performance. A dual-condition architecture connects MLLM and diffusion transformer, leveraging both for improved performance. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP outperforms existing unified models. In image editing, UniLIP achieves a high score on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models. Overall, UniLIP expands CLIP's application range, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding, generation, and editing tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new framework called Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM) for Text-Video Retrieval, addressing the issue of candidate prior bias in retrieval models. BLiM leverages both query and candidate likelihoods to enhance relevance between text and video queries. The model is trained to generate text from video and video features from text. Additionally, Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) is introduced to mitigate candidate prior bias without the need for training. Performance evaluation on four benchmarks shows that BLiM with CPN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by 6.4 in R@1 on average, emphasizing query-candidate relevance and reducing bias towards candidates with higher inherent priors. The study also demonstrates the broad applicability of CPN in various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval, enhancing visual understanding and reducing reliance on textual priors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark called Layout Error Detection (LED) to evaluate the structural robustness of document layout predictions. It addresses challenges in detecting critical structural errors such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP are insufficient for detecting these errors, which LED aims to rectify. LED defines standardized error types and formulates tasks for error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification. The article also introduces the LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset generated with realistic structural errors based on empirical distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across various Large Language Models (LLMs) reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding capabilities, highlighting modality biases and performance trade-offs that are not apparent through traditional metrics. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However, despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap, are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible through traditional metrics.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach for geometric image editing that involves repositioning, reorienting, or reshaping objects within an image while maintaining scene coherence. The proposed method utilizes a decoupled pipeline, separating object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. It makes use of a training-free diffusion approach called FreeFine for both inpainting and refinement. The experiments conducted on the GeoBench benchmark, which includes 2D and 3D editing scenarios, show that FreeFine outperforms existing methods in terms of image fidelity and edit precision, especially when dealing with challenging transformations. The code and benchmark for this approach are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations.

Summary:<br />
ST-SAM introduces a novel approach to Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) that overcomes limitations of existing methods. It utilizes Self-Training to filter and expand high-confidence pseudo-labels dynamically, enhancing a single-model architecture to avoid prediction bias and error propagation. By transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts, ST-SAM leverages the Segment Anything Model's domain-specific knowledge to reduce error accumulation in self-training. Experimental results demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, surpassing existing SSCOD methods and rivaling fully supervised techniques. Notably, ST-SAM requires training a single network, offering high efficiency without specific model dependencies or loss functions. This work introduces a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD, providing a scalable and computationally economical solution for object detection tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.23307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

It effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to improve accuracy and reliability. The framework includes an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features and a data-driven shape template space for encoding low-dimensional representations of road elements. This enables clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. A diffusion-based framework leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate predictions.

arXiv:2507.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements. A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Summary: 
Linear merging of models in continual learning was investigated in this paper using controlled visual cues in computer vision experiments. The study showed that merging models largely preserves or enhances shared knowledge, while task-specific knowledge that is not shared degrades rapidly. The research also found that merging models from an incremental training process consistently outperformed models trained in parallel. This suggests that the sequential acquisition of knowledge through continuous learning is more effective in merging models. The results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of model integration in continual learning settings, particularly in the context of computer vision tasks. The study provides valuable insights into the benefits of merging models to maintain and enhance shared knowledge while leveraging task-specific knowledge effectively in a continual learning framework.

By using cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, the study reveals varying degrees of content-style separation. It found that in many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions, while style tokens affect background and texture areas. This suggests an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction within the models. The research sheds light on how these large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. The code, dataset, and an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps are shared for further research and understanding at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

Summary:
FastDriveVLA introduces a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework, ReconPruner, specifically designed for autonomous driving. The framework prioritizes foreground information crucial for decision-making in driving scenarios. A new adversarial reconstruction strategy is employed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. This approach enables seamless application to different VLA models without retraining. The model is trained on nuScenes-FG, a large-scale dataset containing annotated foreground regions in image-mask pairs.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

<div> Lane segment topology reasoning, fast-slow framework, temporal propagation, latent world models, autonomous driving

Summary:
FASTopoWM is a novel lane segment topology reasoning framework that leverages fast-slow architecture and latent world models. It effectively incorporates temporal cues to enhance detection and reasoning performance in autonomous driving systems. By parallel supervision of historical and newly initialized queries, it reduces the impact of pose estimation failures and improves temporal propagation. The introduction of latent world models conditioned on action latent enhances state representations from past observations to the current timestep, leading to significant improvements in temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Experimental results on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark show that FASTopoWM outperforms existing methods in lane segment detection and centerline perception, achieving higher mAP and OLS scores. <div>

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).

Summary:
This paper introduces a domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation to address the performance degradation caused by domain shift in clinical workflows. The framework incorporates implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics, utilizing a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate domain-variant features while maintaining anatomical consistency.

arXiv:2507.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency. Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches, achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse clinical domains.

<div> Keywords: Traffic sign recognition, autonomous driving, long-tail distribution, multi-scale features, multimodal contrastive learning

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel two-stage framework for traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving systems. The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by the long-tail distribution of traffic sign datasets and the presence of small, multi-scale targets in real-world scenarios. The first stage of the framework utilizes a NanoVerse YOLO model with a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network and an SPD-Conv module for effective traffic sign detection. In the second stage, a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model is employed for traffic sign classification. By combining visual and semantic features through Vision Transformer and rule-based BERT, the model learns robust representations that are independent of class frequency, reducing confusion caused by data imbalance. Experimental results on the TT100K dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in long-tail detection tasks and outperform mainstream algorithms in terms of accuracy and generalization in complex environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel framework for road surface reconstruction to support autonomous driving in complex urban settings. The method combines occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to achieve accurate and visually consistent reconstructions. By utilizing planar-adapted Gaussian representation, the framework efficiently models large-scale road surfaces. Additionally, segmentation-guided video inpainting is employed to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, enhancing the overall reconstruction quality. Color coherence is improved through semantic-aware correction in HSV space, resulting in visually coherent and geometrically accurate reconstructions. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to existing methods, particularly under real-world conditions. <div>

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions, they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12 exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers" because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I) models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at https://github.com/zyj-2000/Talker.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

<div> Keywords: large vision-language models, layer pruning, multi-modal understanding, feature gaps, Short-LVLM

Summary:
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-modal understanding, but their practical applications are hindered by high computational costs. Existing layer pruning techniques from natural language processing are ineffective when directly applied to LVLMs due to modality divergence and inter-layer feature gaps. In this paper, a novel framework called Short-LVLM (SVL) is proposed to address these challenges. SVL leverages important vision-language tokens and mitigates feature gaps, resulting in a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, SVL is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible. The framework demonstrates several potential advantages and the code is publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

The paper introduces UniEmo, a unified framework that integrates emotional understanding and generation tasks. It proposes a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries to extract multi-scale emotional features.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks, yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification. Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/UniEmo.

<div> progressive alignment strategy, CLIP, unsupervised domain adaptation, feature learning, MP^2A

Summary:
The article introduces MP^2A, a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream tasks in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios. The method aims to address the challenges of aligning source and target domains by gradually incorporating challenging samples as training progresses. By starting with a high-confidence subset of target samples, the model learns a well-aligned representation from reliable data, then refines its understanding without being overwhelmed by label noise. This approach mitigates confirmation bias and promotes robust convergence, enabling the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. Experiment results on ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet benchmarks show that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent CLIP-based multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization. State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features. However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene representation.

<title>AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning</title>

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a promising direction in representation learning. However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging via Diffusion Trajectories</title>

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

<title>Beyond Linear Bottlenecks: Spline-Based Knowledge Distillation for Culturally Diverse Art Style Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23436</link>

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate, often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds, leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

<title>Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network</title>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

<title>Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection</title>

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.

<title>CST Anti-UAV: A Thermal Infrared Benchmark for Tiny UAV Tracking in Complex Scenes</title>

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured 3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner, but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a 3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and real-captured patterns. Project page: https://mutianxu.github.io/stable-sim2real/.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations. This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass. Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU) scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources, mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However, existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's `concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels, we identify that different architectures have statistically different concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct classifications.

<title>ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction</title>

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.

<title>3D-MOOD: Lifting 2D to 3D for Monocular Open-Set Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

<title>Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields for Privacy-Preserving Visual Localization</title>

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

<title>Beyond Gloss: A Hand-Centric Framework for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23575</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with fewer parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/zhuyaoye/MamV2XCalib.

<title>MoGA: 3D Generative Avatar Prior for Monocular Gaussian Avatar Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23597</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage. However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.

<title>DivControl: Knowledge Diversion for Controllable Image Generation</title>

arXiv:2507.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image (I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps, enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward (FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and 75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation. Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used, enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves 2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

arXiv:2507.23657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution. Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA, WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/omnitraj

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views. To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code will be released.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering (VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections. For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions. However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

arXiv:2507.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors, termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities. OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/DIAS.

<title>SeqAffordSplat: Scene-level Sequential Affordance Reasoning on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

arXiv:2507.23772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents. Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

<title>Half-Physics: Enabling Kinematic 3D Human Model with Physical Interactions</title>

arXiv:2507.23778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result, kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics. Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating physical interactions

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild. In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations, we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on https://github.com/ImNotPrepared/MonoFusion.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33 bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models, contributing to the development of more robust methods.

<title>Gaussian Variation Field Diffusion for High-fidelity Video-to-4D Synthesis</title>

arXiv:2507.23785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both quantitively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

<title>Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale, as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions, adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be found at https://github.com/HarryShomer/MAPLE.

<title>Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation</title>

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization, cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification. Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

<title>Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them. Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly, surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast. State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii) cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First, it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting; learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key considerations for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use, Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout", tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences, and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10 participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the physical world.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution (LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping, conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges. LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First, we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions. Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally, recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction. Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in neuronal topology reconstruction.

<title>MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore, camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce- dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31 {\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms, standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WooKyoungHan/JPNeO.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge: the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data, and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions. Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments, single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary (Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations, generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex, open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts. Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive, artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early intervention.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work, we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance. These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome imputation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces. In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology (PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at https://github.com/justinkay/coda.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of objects in visual perception in the absence of any semantic annotation. The resulting model has received no supervision, does not use any pre-trained features, and yet it can segment the domain of an image into multiple independently moving regions. The resulting motion segmentation method can handle an unknown and varying number of objects in real-time. The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. Objects bootstrapped by DivA can then be used to prime static classifiers via contrastive learning. On fewer than 5,000 video clips, training DINO on DivA's object proposals narrows the performance gap to ImageNet-based training by up to 30.2% compared to training directly on the video frames.

Abstract: Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.

<title>Sparse Reconstruction of Optical Doppler Tomography with Alternative State Space Model and Attention</title>

Abstract: Optical coherence Doppler tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow imaging technique. The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D depth-resolved trace named raw A-scans (or A-line). A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is formed by reconstructing a cross-sectional flow image via Doppler phase-subtraction of raw A-scans along B-line. To obtain a high-fidelity B-scan, densely sampled A-scans are required currently, leading to prolonged scanning time and increased storage demands. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel sparse ODT reconstruction framework with an Alternative State Space Attention Network (ASSAN) that effectively reduces raw A-scans needed. Inspired by the distinct distributions of information along A-line and B-line, ASSAN applies 1D State Space Model (SSM) to each A-line to learn the intra-A-scan representation, while using 1D gated self-attention along B-line to capture the inter-A-scan features. In addition, an effective feedforward network based on sequential 1D convolutions along different axes is employed to enhance the local feature. In validation experiments on real animal data, ASSAN shows clear effectiveness in the reconstruction in comparison with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) remains a crucial aspect for fostering trust and understanding in machine learning models. Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\% in NSS compared to GradCAM). This comparison enhances our confidence in FovEx's ability to close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.

<title>SDFit: 3D Object Pose and Shape by Fitting a Morphable SDF to a Single Image</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16178</link>

Abstract: Recovering 3D object pose and shape from a single image is a challenging and ill-posed problem. This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to real-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering pixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel render-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key innovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively refining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining the search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape topologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the image, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape databases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D correspondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features. We evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC. SDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and common poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses. Moreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes new insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at https://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.

Abstract: Distance-based metrics, such as the Hausdorff distance (HD), are widely used to validate segmentation performance in (bio)medical imaging. However, their implementation is complex, and critical differences across open-source tools remain largely unrecognized by the community. These discrepancies undermine benchmarking efforts, introduce bias in biomarker calculations, and potentially distort medical device development and clinical commissioning. In this study, we systematically dissect 11 open-source tools that implement distance-based metric computation by performing both a conceptual analysis of their computational steps and an empirical analysis on representative two- and three-dimensional image datasets. Alarmingly, we observed deviations in HD exceeding 100 mm and identified multiple statistically significant differences between tools - demonstrating that statistically significant improvements on the same set of segmentations can be achieved simply by selecting a particular implementation. These findings cast doubts on the validity of prior comparisons of results across studies without accounting for the differences in metric implementations. To address this, we provide practical recommendations for tool selection; additionally, our conceptual analysis informs about the future evolution of implementing open-source tools.

Abstract: Mistake action detection is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Existing studies have focused on visually apparent mistakes in free-style activities, resulting in video-only approaches to mistake detection. However, in text-following activities, models cannot determine the correctness of some actions without referring to the texts. Additionally, current mistake datasets rarely use procedural texts for video recording except for cooking. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes the EgoOops dataset, where egocentric videos record erroneous activities when following procedural texts across diverse domains. It features three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. We also propose a mistake detection approach, combining video-text alignment and mistake label classification to leverage the texts. Our experimental results show that incorporating procedural texts is essential for mistake detection. Data is available through https://y-haneji.github.io/EgoOops-project-page/.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects or regions within 3D scenes guided by natural language descriptions. While indoor 3D VG has advanced, outdoor 3D VG remains underexplored due to two challenges: (1) large-scale outdoor LiDAR scenes are dominated by background points and contain limited foreground information, making cross-modal alignment and contextual understanding more difficult; and (2) most outdoor datasets lack spatial annotations for referential non-target objects, which hinders explicit learning of referential context. To this end, we propose LidaRefer, a context-aware 3D VG framework for outdoor scenes. LidaRefer incorporates an object-centric feature selection strategy to focus on semantically relevant visual features while reducing computational overhead. Then, its transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture excels at establishing fine-grained cross-modal alignment between refined visual features and word-level text features, and capturing comprehensive global context. Additionally, we present Discriminative-Supportive Collaborative localization (DiSCo), a novel supervision strategy that explicitly models spatial relationships between target, contextual, and ambiguous objects for accurate target identification. To enable this without manual labeling, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach that retrieves 3D localization labels for referential non-target objects. LidaRefer achieves state-of-the-art performance on Talk2Car-3D dataset under various evaluation settings.

Abstract: In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/DHCP.

Abstract: In recent years, simultaneous learning of multiple dense prediction tasks with partially annotated label data has emerged as an important research area. Previous works primarily focus on leveraging cross-task relations or conducting adversarial training for extra regularization, which achieve promising performance improvements, while still suffering from the lack of direct pixel-wise supervision and extra training of heavy mapping networks. To effectively tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to optimize a set of compact learnable hierarchical task tokens, including global and fine-grained ones, to discover consistent pixel-wise supervision signals in both feature and prediction levels. Specifically, the global task tokens are designed for effective cross-task feature interactions in a global context. Then, a group of fine-grained task-specific spatial tokens for each task is learned from the corresponding global task tokens. It is embedded to have dense interactions with each task-specific feature map. The learned global and local fine-grained task tokens are further used to discover pseudo task-specific dense labels at different levels of granularity, and they can be utilized to directly supervise the learning of the multi-task dense prediction framework. Extensive experimental results on challenging NYUD-v2, Cityscapes, and PASCAL Context datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for partially annotated multi-task dense prediction.

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational costs pose a significant barrier to wide application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios. The code for this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ASGO-MM/Pruning-All-Rounder.

Abstract: No published work on visual question answering (VQA) accounts for ambiguity regarding where the content described in the question is located in the image. To fill this gap, we introduce VQ-FocusAmbiguity, the first VQA dataset that visually grounds each plausible image region a question could refer to when arriving at valid answers. We next analyze and compare our dataset to existing datasets to reveal its unique properties. Finally, we benchmark modern models for two novel tasks related to acknowledging focus ambiguity: recognizing whether a visual question has focus ambiguity and locating all plausible focus regions within the image. Results show that the dataset is challenging for modern models. To facilitate future progress on these tasks, we publicly share the dataset with an evaluation server at https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/focus-ambiguity-in-visual-questions.

Abstract: Access to below-canopy volumetric vegetation data is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks with mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume. Compared with simulated ground truth, our correction leads to ~x7 average improvements (min: ~x2, max: ~x12) for forest densities of 220 trees/ha - 1680 trees/ha. In our field experiment, we achieved an MSE of 0.05 when comparing with the top-vegetation layer that was measured with classical multispectral aerial imaging.

Abstract: Autonomous driving simulators provide an effective and low-cost alternative for evaluating or enhancing visual perception models. However, the reliability of evaluation depends on the diversity and realism of the generated scenes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly extreme rainfalls, are rare and costly to capture in real-world settings. While simulated environments can help address this limitation, existing rainy image synthesizers often suffer from poor controllability over illumination and limited realism, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the model evaluation. To that end, we propose a learning-from-rendering rainy image synthesizer, which combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the controllability of learning-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of our extreme rainy image synthesizer on semantic segmentation task, we require a continuous set of well-labeled extreme rainy images. By integrating the proposed synthesizer with the CARLA driving simulator, we develop CARLARain an extreme rainy street scene simulator which can obtain paired rainy-clean images and labels under complex illumination conditions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that CARLARain can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models in extreme rainy scenes, with the models' accuracy (mIoU) improved by 5% - 8% on the synthetic dataset and significantly enhanced in real extreme rainy scenarios under complex illuminations. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kb824999404/CARLARain/.

Abstract: Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background--like humans do--Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture--Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO)--that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer the knowledge of a more capable yet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. In recent years, relation-based KD methods have fallen behind, as their instance-matching counterparts dominate in performance. In this paper, we revive relational KD by identifying and tackling several key issues in relation-based methods, including their susceptibility to overfitting and spurious responses. Specifically, we transfer novelly constructed affinity graphs that compactly encapsulate a wealth of beneficial inter-sample, inter-class, and inter-view correlations by exploiting virtual views and relations as a new kind of knowledge. As a result, the student has access to richer guidance signals and stronger regularisation throughout the distillation process. To further mitigate the adverse impact of spurious responses, we prune the affinity graphs by dynamically detaching redundant and unreliable edges. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed virtual relation matching (VRM) method, where it consistently sets new state-of-the-art records over a range of models, architectures, tasks, and set-ups. For instance, VRM for the first time hits 74.0% accuracy for ResNet50-to-MobileNetV2 distillation on ImageNet, and improves DeiT-T by 14.44% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet56 teacher.

Abstract: Real-time video segmentation is a promising opportunity for AI-assisted surgery, offering intraoperative guidance by identifying tools and anatomical structures. Despite growing interest in surgical video segmentation, annotation protocols vary widely across datasets -- some provide dense, frame-by-frame labels, while others rely on sparse annotations sampled at low frame rates such as 1 FPS. In this study, we investigate how such inconsistencies in annotation density and frame rate sampling influence the evaluation of zero-shot segmentation models, using SAM2 as a case study for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, we find that under conventional sparse evaluation settings, lower frame rates can appear to outperform higher ones due to a smoothing effect that conceals temporal inconsistencies. However, when assessed under real-time streaming conditions, higher frame rates yield superior segmentation stability, particularly for dynamic objects like surgical graspers. To understand how these differences align with human perception, we conducted a survey among surgeons, nurses, and machine learning engineers and found that participants consistently preferred high-FPS segmentation overlays, reinforcing the importance of evaluating every frame in real-time applications rather than relying on sparse sampling strategies. Our findings highlight the risk of evaluation bias that is introduced by inconsistent dataset protocols and bring attention to the need for temporally fair benchmarking in surgical video AI.

At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) is a challenging task given that only bag-level labels are provided, while each bag typically contains multiple instances. This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets. Our WeakSupCon code is available at github.com/BzhangURU/Paper_WeakSupCon

Abstract: We completely classify all minimal problems for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) where arrangements of points and lines are fully observed by multiple uncalibrated pinhole cameras. We find 291 minimal problems, 73 of which have unique solutions and can thus be solved linearly. Two of the linear problems allow an arbitrary number of views, while all other minimal problems have at most 9 cameras. All minimal problems have at most 7 points and at most 12 lines. We compute the number of solutions of each minimal problem, as this gives a measurement of the problem's intrinsic difficulty, and find that these number are relatively low (e.g., when comparing with minimal problems for calibrated cameras). Finally, by exploring stabilizer subgroups of subarrangements, we develop a geometric and systematic way to 1) factorize minimal problems into smaller problems, 2) identify minimal problems in underconstrained problems, and 3) formally prove non-minimality.

<title>Recovering Partially Corrupted Objects via Sketch-Guided Bidirectional Feature Interaction</title>

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in object inpainting by providing high-level semantic guidance through text prompts. However, they often lack precise pixel-level spatial control, especially in scenarios involving partially corrupted objects where critical uncorrupted cues remain. To overcome this limitation, sketch-guided methods have been introduced, using either indirect gradient modulation or direct sketch injection to improve structural control. Yet, existing approaches typically establish a one-way mapping from the sketch to the masked regions only, neglecting the contextual information from unmasked object areas. This leads to a disconnection between the sketch and the uncorrupted content, thereby causing sketch-guided inconsistency and structural mismatch. To tackle this challenge, we propose a sketch-guided bidirectional feature interaction framework built upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Our bidirectional interaction features two complementary directions, context-to-sketch and sketch-to-inpainting, that enable fine-grained spatial control for partially corrupted object inpainting. In the context-to-sketch direction, multi-scale latents from uncorrupted object regions are propagated to the sketch branch to generate a visual mask that adapts the sketch features to the visible context and denoising progress. In the sketch-to-inpainting direction, a sketch-conditional affine transformation modulates the influence of sketch guidance based on the learned visual mask, ensuring consistency with uncorrupted object content. This interaction is applied at multiple scales within the encoder of the diffusion U-Net, enabling the model to restore object structures with enhanced spatial fidelity. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.

Abstract: We present a novel human-in-the-loop approach to estimate 3D scene layout that uses human feedback from an egocentric standpoint. We study this approach through introduction of a novel local correction task, where users identify local errors and prompt a model to automatically correct them. Building on SceneScript, a state-of-the-art framework for 3D scene layout estimation that leverages structured language, we propose a solution that structures this problem as "infilling", a task studied in natural language processing. We train a multi-task version of SceneScript that maintains performance on global predictions while significantly improving its local correction ability. We integrate this into a human-in-the-loop system, enabling a user to iteratively refine scene layout estimates via a low-friction "one-click fix'' workflow. Our system enables the final refined layout to diverge from the training distribution, allowing for more accurate modelling of complex layouts.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop an intuitive number sense similar to humans? Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities. Code and dataset are available at https://wwwtttjjj.github.io/VisNumBench/.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.

Abstract: Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

<title>Beyond the Encoder: Joint Encoder-Decoder Contrastive Pre-Training Improves Dense Prediction</title>

Abstract: Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting an established contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction tasks, DeCon achieves new state-of-the-art results: on COCO object detection and instance segmentation when pre-trained on COCO dataset; across almost all dense downstream benchmark tasks when pre-trained on COCO+ and ImageNet-1K. Our results demonstrate that joint pre-training enhances the representation power of the encoder and improves performance in dense prediction tasks. This gain persists across heterogeneous decoder architectures, various encoder architectures, and in out-of-domain limited-data scenarios.

Abstract: Two-hand reconstruction from monocular images faces persistent challenges due to complex and dynamic hand postures and occlusions, causing significant difficulty in achieving plausible interaction alignment. Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a dual-stage Foundation-to-Diffusion framework that precisely align 2D prior guidance from vision foundation models and diffusion-based generative 3D interaction refinement to achieve occlusion-robust two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a lightweight fusion alignment encoder that aligns fused multimodal 2D priors like key points, segmentation maps, and depth cues from vision foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without heavy foundation model encoders at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we implement a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to convert interpenetrated 3D poses into plausible, penetration-free counterparts. Through collision gradient-guided denoising, the model rectifies artifacts while preserving natural spatial relationships between hands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, HIC, and FreiHAND datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness. Our code will be publicly released.

Abstract: The development of aerial holistic scene understanding algorithms is hindered by the scarcity of comprehensive datasets that enable both semantic and geometric reconstruction. While synthetic datasets offer an alternative, existing options exhibit task-specific limitations, unrealistic scene compositions, and rendering artifacts that compromise real-world applicability. We introduce ClaraVid, a synthetic aerial dataset specifically designed to overcome these limitations. Comprising 16,917 high-resolution images captured at 4032x3024 from multiple viewpoints across diverse landscapes, ClaraVid provides dense depth maps, panoptic segmentation, sparse point clouds, and dynamic object masks, while mitigating common rendering artifacts. To further advance neural reconstruction, we introduce the Delentropic Scene Profile (DSP), a novel complexity metric derived from differential entropy analysis, designed to quantitatively assess scene difficulty and inform reconstruction tasks. Utilizing DSP, we systematically benchmark neural reconstruction methods, uncovering a consistent, measurable correlation between scene complexity and reconstruction accuracy. Empirical results indicate that higher delentropy strongly correlates with increased reconstruction errors, validating DSP as a reliable complexity prior. The data and code are available on the project page at https://rdbch.github.io/claravid/

Abstract: The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing attention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the models and codes are made publicly available.

Abstract: Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks. The source codes are released at https://github.com/huxingyuabc/TITA.

Abstract: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach. The code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/continental/EP-Diffuser.

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.

Abstract: Fire detection in dynamic environments faces continuous challenges, including the interference of illumination changes, many false detections or missed detections, and it is difficult to achieve both efficiency and accuracy. To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Abstract: Despite advances in general video understanding, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) face challenges in precise temporal localization due to discrete time representations and limited temporally aware datasets. Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks. Code and data are released at https://github.com/josephzpng/DisTime.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for continual learning in anomaly detection, aimed at better reflecting real-world deployment scenarios. Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models. We release the benchmark and code in https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega.

Abstract: Electronic component classification and detection are crucial in manufacturing industries, significantly reducing labor costs and promoting technological and industrial development. Pre-trained models, especially those trained on ImageNet, are highly effective in image classification, allowing researchers to achieve excellent results even with limited data. This paper compares the performance of twelve ImageNet pre-trained models in classifying electronic components. Our findings show that all models tested delivered respectable accuracies. MobileNet-V2 recorded the highest at 99.95%, while EfficientNet-B0 had the lowest at 92.26%. These results underscore the substantial benefits of using ImageNet pre-trained models in image classification tasks and confirm the practical applicability of these methods in the electronics manufacturing sector.

Abstract: Most crowd counting methods directly regress blockwise density maps using Mean Squared Error (MSE) losses. This practice has two key limitations: (1) it fails to account for the extreme spatial sparsity of annotations - over 95% of 8x8 blocks are empty across standard benchmarks, so supervision signals in informative regions are diluted by the predominant zeros; (2) MSE corresponds to a Gaussian error model that poorly matches discrete, non-negative count data. To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood: a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty (handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount provided that the training resolution is moderately large. To assess the scalability of ZIP, we instantiate it on backbones spanning over 100x in parameters/compute. Experiments on ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU-Crowd demonstrate that ZIP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all model scales.

<title>Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision, particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter, facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving community.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a state-of-the-art generative modeling framework that transform noise to images via Langevin sampling, guided by the score, which is the gradient of the logarithm of the data distribution. Recent works have shown empirically that the generation quality can be improved when guided by classifier network, which is typically the discriminator trained in a generative adversarial network (GAN) setting. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM. The proposed approach serves to unify score-based training and optimization of IPM-GANs. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that closed-form kernel-based discriminator guidance, results in improvements (in terms of CLIP-FID and KID metrics) when applied atop baseline diffusion models. We demonstrate these results on the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and latent diffusion model (LDM) settings on various standard datasets. We also show that the proposed approach can be combined with existing accelerated-diffusion techniques to improve latent-space image generation.

Abstract: The past few years have witnessed substantial advances in image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that diffusion models are susceptible to training data memorization, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and privacy invasion. This study delves into a rigorous analysis of memorization in diffusion models. We introduce InvMM, an inversion-based measure of memorization, which is based on inverting a sensitive latent noise distribution accounting for the replication of an image. For accurate estimation of the measure, we propose an adaptive algorithm that balances the normality and sensitivity of the noise distribution. Comprehensive experiments across four datasets, conducted on both unconditional and text-guided diffusion models, demonstrate that InvMM provides a reliable and complete quantification of memorization. Notably, InvMM is commensurable between samples, reveals the true extent of memorization from an adversarial standpoint and implies how memorization differs from membership. In practice, it serves as an auditing tool for developers to reliably assess the risk of memorization, thereby contributing to the enhancement of trustworthiness and privacy-preserving capabilities of diffusion models.

Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. Identifying mild syndrome with small pathological regions serves as an ominous warning and is fundamental in the early diagnosis of diseases. While deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in segmenting medical objects, analyzing small areas in medical images remains challenging. This difficulty arises due to information losses and compression defects from convolution and pooling operations in CNNs, which become more pronounced as the network deepens, especially for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurately segmenting small-scale objects in medical images. The SvANet consists of scale-variant attention, cross-scale guidance, Monte Carlo attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot's actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots' materials, actuation, or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.

Abstract: Depth perception is essential for a robot's spatial and geometric understanding of its environment, with many tasks traditionally relying on hardware-based depth sensors like RGB-D or stereo cameras. However, these sensors face practical limitations, including issues with transparent and reflective objects, high costs, calibration complexity, spatial and energy constraints, and increased failure rates in compound systems. While monocular depth estimation methods offer a cost-effective and simpler alternative, their adoption in robotics is limited due to their output of relative rather than metric depth, which is crucial for robotics applications. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes a single calibrated camera, enabling the robot to act as a "measuring stick" to convert relative depth estimates into metric depth in real-time as tasks are performed. Our approach employs an LSTM-based metric depth regressor, trained online and refined through probabilistic filtering, to accurately restore the metric depth across the monocular depth map, particularly in areas proximal to the robot's motion. Experiments with real robots demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art monocular metric depth estimation techniques, achieving a 22.1% reduction in depth error and a 52% increase in success rate for a downstream task.

Abstract: Enabling digital humans to express rich emotions has significant applications in dialogue systems, gaming, and other interactive scenarios. While recent advances in talking head synthesis have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization, they tend to overlook the rich and dynamic nature of facial expressions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce an end-to-end text-to-expression model that explicitly focuses on emotional dynamics. Our model learns expressive facial variations in a continuous latent space and generates expressions that are diverse, fluid, and emotionally coherent. To support this task, we introduce EmoAva, a large-scale and high-quality dataset containing 15,000 text-3D expression pairs. Extensive experiments on both existing datasets and EmoAva demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, poses a severe clinical challenge due to its diffuse microscopic infiltration, which remains largely undetected on standard MRI. As a result, current radiotherapy planning employs a uniform 15 mm margin around the resection cavity, failing to capture patient-specific tumor spread. Tumor growth modeling offers a promising approach to reveal this hidden infiltration. However, methods based on partial differential equations or physics-informed neural networks tend to be computationally intensive or overly constrained, limiting their clinical adaptability to individual patients. In this work, we propose a lightweight, rapid, and robust optimization framework that estimates the 3D tumor concentration by fitting it to MRI tumor segmentations while enforcing a smooth concentration landscape. This approach achieves superior tumor recurrence prediction on 192 brain tumor patients across two public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while reducing runtime from 30 minutes to less than one minute. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's versatility and adaptability by showing its ability to seamlessly integrate additional imaging modalities or physical constraints.

Abstract: Vision-based control relies on accurate perception to achieve robustness. However, image distribution changes caused by sensor noise, adverse weather, and dynamic lighting can degrade perception, leading to suboptimal control decisions. Existing approaches, including domain adaptation and adversarial training, improve robustness but struggle to generalize to unseen corruptions while introducing computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time image repair module that restores corrupted images before they are used by the controller. Our method leverages generative adversarial models, specifically CycleGAN and pix2pix, for image repair. CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation to adapt to novel corruptions, while pix2pix exploits paired image data when available to improve the quality. To ensure alignment with control performance, we introduce a control-focused loss function that prioritizes perceptual consistency in repaired images. We evaluated our method in a simulated autonomous racing environment with various visual corruptions. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance compared to baselines, mitigating distribution shift and enhancing controller reliability.

<title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.

<title>ModalTune: Fine-Tuning Slide-Level Foundation Models with Multi-Modal Information for Multi-task Learning in Digital Pathology</title>

Abstract: Prediction tasks in digital pathology are challenging due to the massive size of whole-slide images (WSIs) and the weak nature of training signals. Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.

Abstract: Tracking motions of humans or objects in the surroundings of the robot is essential to improve safe robot motions and reactions. In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.

Abstract: Wave-like images-from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames-encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise $\sin(\cdot)$ mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets-including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics-demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). Although pre-trained models (PTMs) have provided a strong foundation for CL, existing approaches face a fundamental challenge in balancing these two competing objectives. Current methods typically address stability by freezing the PTM backbone, which severely limits the model's plasticity, particularly when incoming data distribution diverges largely from the pre-training data. Alternatively, sequentially fine-tuning the entire PTM can adapt to new knowledge but often leads to catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the critical stability-plasticity trade-off in PTM-based CL. To address this limitation, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL} process (ACL), a novel framework that introduces a plug-and-play adaptation phase prior to learning each new task. During this phase, ACL refines the PTM backbone by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from irrelevant classes. This mechanism theoretically and empirically demonstrates desirable balance between stability and plasticity, significantly improving CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods. Code is available at https://github.com/byyx666/ACL_code.

Abstract: In breast cancer HER2 assessment, clinical evaluation relies on combined H&amp;E and IHC images, yet acquiring both modalities is often hindered by clinical constraints and cost. We propose an adaptive bimodal prediction framework that flexibly supports single- or dual-modality inputs through two core innovations: a dynamic branch selector activating modality completion or joint inference based on input availability, and a cross-modal GAN (CM-GAN) enabling feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities. This design dramatically improves H&amp;E-only accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% with full dual-modality inputs, and maintains 90.28% reliability under single-modality conditions. The "dual-modality preferred, single-modality compatible" architecture delivers near-dual-modality accuracy without mandatory synchronized acquisition, offering a cost-effective solution for resource-limited regions and significantly improving HER2 assessment accessibility.

<div> Keywords: 3D human reconstruction, texture alignment, part segmentation, texturing module, image generation network<br />
Summary:<br />PARTE is a novel framework for 3D human reconstruction that addresses the challenge of misaligned textures across different human parts. It leverages 3D part segmentation information to guide the reconstruction process. The framework consists of a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that predicts human part labels based on a textureless surface, and a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer) that utilizes pre-trained image generation networks for texture alignment. By incorporating part information into texture reconstruction, PARTE achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments, highlighting its ability to maintain distinct textures for each human part without blending into others. PARTE's project page provides additional information on the framework and its capabilities.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction. The project page is available at https://hygenie1228.github.io/PARTE/.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions. This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices. Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations; (2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning, prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at https://sites.google.com/view/physics-failure-detection.

Summary:
TRIG-Bench introduces a dataset for exploring trade-offs in image generation models, encompassing 10 dimensions and 40,200 samples. The dataset allows for a detailed evaluation of model performance across various aspects such as realism, aesthetics, ambiguity, and bias. TRIGScore, a metric based on VLM, adapts to different dimensions while evaluating 14 models in text-to-image and image-to-image tasks. The Relation Recognition System generates Dimension Trade-off Maps to visually represent trade-offs among model capabilities. Through experiments, it is shown that the maps provide a deeper understanding of model-specific weaknesses and strengths. Fine-tuning models based on the maps can help improve overall performance by addressing dimension-specific weaknesses. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple aspects when evaluating text-to-image and image-to-image generation models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains 40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to enhance overall performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/fesvhtr/TRIG

The ColorSense Learner framework mimics human color perception for few-shot learning, leveraging inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By highlighting color information across different channels, irrelevant features are filtered while discriminative characteristics are captured. This approach enhances intra-class commonality extraction and inter-class differences. The ColorSense Distiller, a meta-distiller using knowledge distillation, enhances the network's meta-learning ability using prior knowledge. Coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on eleven few-shot benchmarks validate the framework's strong generalization, robustness, and transferability, particularly in handling few-shot classification from a color perception perspective. <div>

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms. We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels, our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the perspective of color perception.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

Summary: 
Frontier-Seg, a novel method, addresses the challenge of unsupervised terrain segmentation in autonomous ground navigation. It utilizes superpixel-level features extracted from DINOv2 backbones to identify persistent terrain boundaries in mobile robot video streams. By enforcing temporal consistency across frames, Frontier-Seg achieves robust perception in unstructured environments without human supervision. This approach overcomes the limitations of costly data collection and labor-intensive labeling associated with supervised methods. Moreover, it performs unsupervised segmentation across diverse off-road environments, including the RUGD and RELLIS-3D datasets. Frontier-Seg shows promise for applications in unrehearsed and ambiguous terrain scenarios where labeled data is scarce or domain-specific. Its ability to provide temporally consistent segmentation makes it a valuable asset for autonomous systems navigating challenging terrain environments.

arXiv:2507.22194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

The model can align textual and visual representations flexibly across different granularities, preserving cross-modal semantic information while disentangling visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. By identifying and aligning the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner, SmartCLIP outperforms CLIP in various tasks and demonstrates superior capability in handling information misalignment. The proposed framework establishes theoretical conditions for flexible alignment between textual and visual representations, enabling the model to learn atomic concepts and generalize better on downstream tasks involving short prompts. The code for SmartCLIP is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

Summary:
The article proposes a clinical decision support framework called HOG-CNN for the automated analysis of fundus images to detect retinal diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration. The framework integrates handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations to capture local texture patterns and high-level semantic features. HOG-CNN achieves high performance on benchmark datasets, with 98.5% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for binary DR classification, 94.2 AUC for multiclass DR classification, 92.8% accuracy for AMD diagnosis, and 83.9% accuracy for Glaucoma detection. The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it suitable for deployment in clinical settings with limited resources. The comprehensive studies demonstrate the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features, positioning HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows, however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC, outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA, our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features. The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a learnable variational model for image reconstruction that combines information from image and measurement domains. It presents a learned alternating minimization algorithm (LAMA) that incorporates a residual learning architecture and demonstrates convergence results. The LAMA-Net, a neural network architecture derived from LAMA, is highly interpretable and showcases outstanding stability and robustness. The integration of an initial-generating network improves performance, resulting in iLAMA-Net. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography validate the effectiveness of LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net compared to state-of-the-art methods. <div>

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work. We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

<div> ViT, CNN, Collaborative Domain Adaptation, late-life depression, structural brain MRI <br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain MRI is crucial. Existing approaches for LLD detection face challenges due to limited sample sizes. The Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework proposed in this study leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for global anatomical context and local structural feature extraction, respectively. The framework includes supervised training on labeled source data, self-supervised target feature adaptation, and collaborative training on unlabeled target data. By utilizing pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, the CDA enhances domain robustness and generalization. Experimental results on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods. <div>

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b) self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer. The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework to handle unfavorable input views. Traditional rendering setups for training feed-forward models are limited to favorable views, hindering real-world application. To address this limitation, a novel adaptation framework is proposed, utilizing pretrained models with low-rank adaptation layers and Gaussian adapter modules. Prior information from favorable images is leveraged to enhance geometric consistency and render accurate target views. A training strategy using an off-the-shelf dataset of favorable images is introduced. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets validate the method's effectiveness in handling unfavorable views. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Summary:<br />
Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in satellite imagery is crucial. Traditional methods are limited in supporting interactive, query-driven analysis. This work introduces RSICA, combining change detection and visual question answering for multi-turn exploration. ChangeChat-105k, a large instruction-following dataset, is created to cover various interaction types. DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture, is proposed for interactive RSICA. It includes a fine-tuned vision encoder, visual difference perception module, and instruction-guided Q-former.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the novel task of generalized face discovery (GFD), which combines traditional face identification with generalized category discovery. GFD requires recognizing known identities while also discovering new, unseen identities. The proposed method, FaceGCD, utilizes dynamically constructed instance-specific feature extractors generated by a HyperNetwork to capture subtle identity-specific cues. This approach outperforms existing methods and a strong baseline, ArcFace, in the GFD task, advancing open-world face recognition. <div>
arXiv:2507.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face recognition.

Summary: GVD introduces a diffusion-based video distillation method, capturing spatial and temporal features for high-quality video generation. It surpasses previous methods on MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets, achieving 78.29% and 73.83% performance, respectively, with minimal frames. GVD can generate higher resolution videos and increase Instances Per Class (IPC) without added computational costs. <div>
arXiv:2507.22360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data. We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features, ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC). Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF. Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30 percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without significantly increasing computational cost.

The framework leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention architecture to make joint predictions based on input scene, group members, and context information. The authors extend the existing VGAF dataset to provide more detailed analysis beyond group-level emotions. GEMS predicts discrete and continuous emotions, including valence and arousal, at various levels of granularity. The benchmarking results show that GEMS outperforms state-of-the-art models on the VGAF-GEMS dataset. The code and data for GEMS are available on GitHub, opening up opportunities for further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end, we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further research. The code and data is available at: https://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS

Summary:<br />
This study explores the vulnerability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to subtle frequency-based perturbations in image content. The researchers demonstrate that these perturbations can disrupt the accuracy of VLM outputs in tasks such as DeepFake detection and image captioning. By manipulating images in the frequency domain, they show that VLMs can be misled into providing incorrect judgments, highlighting the potential fragility of these models. The findings suggest that VLMs may not always align with the true semantic content of images, especially when faced with visually-imperceptible frequency transformations. These results call into question the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications and emphasize the importance of developing more robust multimodal perception systems. Overall, the study highlights the need for further research to enhance the resilience of VLMs to frequency-based attacks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection. In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

The article introduces the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework as an improved self-supervised learning method. MINR combines implicit neural representations with masked image modeling to enhance feature representation learning. Unlike masked autoencoders (MAE), MINR does not heavily rely on specific masking strategies during training and provides more robust and generalizable reconstructions, even for out-of-distribution data. MINR outperforms MAE in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios while maintaining model simplicity.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations, we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to existing frameworks.

<div> Keywords: Moir\'e patterns, deep learning, image restoration, convolutional neural networks, artifact suppression

Summary:
Moir\'e patterns, caused by aliasing between structures and camera sensors, are a challenge in real-world applications. Existing CNN-based solutions struggle with diverse moir\'e patterns due to limited receptive fields. A new U-shaped network, MZNet, is proposed to remove moir\'é patterns effectively. It integrates Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for multi-scale feature extraction, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for diverse pattern capture, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for information flow. MZNet excels on high-resolution datasets, competes well on lower resolution, and maintains low computational cost. This efficient solution for real-world applications achieves state-of-the-art performance on moir\'é pattern removal. <div>

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns, primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns. It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together, these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs' surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses. These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis (NVS).

<div> Keywords: aleatoric uncertainty, medical image segmentation, generative model, conditional flow matching, segmentation accuracy

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation by leveraging conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model. The current diffusion-based approaches have limitations in accurately capturing uncertainty due to their stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities. In contrast, the proposed method guides the flow model on the input image and samples multiple data points to synthesize segmentation samples reflecting the underlying data distribution. This approach produces segmentation results with highly accurate pixel-wise variance, particularly in regions with ambiguous boundaries. Experimental results show that the method achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and generates uncertainty maps that offer insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this work is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries, offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

Summary: 
LVLMs have become crucial in vision-language tasks, with CLIP as a key component. A new data refinement pipeline leverages LVLMs to enhance image-text pair data quality, creating VLM-150M dataset with multiple annotations. By incorporating negative descriptions and short tags, HQ-CLIP model improves upon traditional contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and visual understanding tasks. Surpassing models trained on larger datasets, HQ-CLIP showcases the effectiveness of this approach in improving performance with limited data resources. The code, data, and models are accessible for further exploration and research at https://zxwei.site/hqclip. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data than ours.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel domain adaptation approach for human pose estimation in the presence of motion blur. Traditional pose estimation models struggle in blurred environments due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. By leveraging event cameras, which are robust to motion blur, and utilizing event-based augmentation, the researchers generate motion-aware blurred images to bridge this domain gap without requiring paired annotations. They also develop a student-teacher framework that refines pseudo-labels iteratively using mutual uncertainty masking to enhance learning. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur in real-world scenarios. The findings showcase the potential of event cameras as an effective solution for domain adaptation in motion blur environments. <div>

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments.

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach, EDTR, for task-driven image restoration (TDIR), which aims to improve high-level vision tasks performance using low-quality inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggled with restoring images degraded by complex factors, motivating the use of the diffusion prior. EDTR effectively utilizes the diffusion prior by incorporating useful clues from mildly noisy pre-restored LQ images. By applying a small number of denoising steps, redundant details are prevented, enhancing task-related information. The method significantly boosts task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with various complex degradations. The combination of pixel-error-based pre-restored images and the diffusion prior proves to be successful in restoring task-relevant details, making EDTR a promising approach for TDIR. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.

Summary: <br />
- Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level masks for objects in videos without prior annotations.
- Existing UVOS methods rely too heavily on high-level semantic features, resulting in imprecise predictions due to the lack of fine-grained information.

- HMHI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in UVOS and video saliency detection benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and robustness across different backbones. <div>

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations. While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently, memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM), we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness. Project page: https://github.com/ZhengxyFlow/HMHI-Net .

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media, identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465 in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Karl1109/LIDAR-Mamba.

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization in zero-shot settings.

Summary:
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer) is introduced to address the challenges faced by All-in-One models in capturing diverse degradation patterns caused by adverse weather conditions. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features and low-frequency information, leveraging spectral decomposition and group-wise attention. By utilizing multi-head linear attention, the model effectively models the relationship between these features and generates a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on spatial similarity and image texture.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns, driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and 46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities. Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile, simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wangzy01/ACTIVE-Action-from-Robotic-View.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new dataset containing annotated hepatic vasculature in surgical videos and proposes a high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network, HRVVS. By incorporating a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling model into the encoder and using a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network, HRVVS aims to improve information retention and minimize redundancy in the segmentation process. Experimental results on surgical video datasets demonstrate that HRVVS outperforms existing methods. The source code and dataset will be made publicly available, advancing research in the segmentation of hepatic vasculature in surgical videos. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures. However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain. To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and 11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/scott-yjyang/xx}{https://github.com/scott-yjyang/HRVVS}.

<div> Keywords: prompt-based continual learning, task-specific knowledge, prompt-evolving mechanism, class-incremental learning, adaptive aggregation

Summary:
In the domain of continual learning, a new approach called prompt-based continual learning is proposed. This method involves tuning small parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen, eliminating the need for rehearsal. The key challenge lies in effectively integrating task-specific knowledge into prompts. Existing methods either use fixed learned prompts or prompts generated from a task-shared space, limiting diversity. To address this limitation, a novel prompt-evolving mechanism is introduced, which dynamically aggregates base prompts and ensures diversity. A learnable probabilistic gate is incorporated to adaptively determine which layers to activate during the evolution process. The efficacy of this approach is validated on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, showcasing significant performance gains over existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.22553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>COOkeD: Ensemble-based OOD detection in the era of zero-shot CLIP</title>

<div> Keywords: out-of-distribution detection, ensemble learning, CLIP, image recognition, robustness<br />
Summary:<br />
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for trustworthy image recognition systems. Traditional methods rely on single classifiers, limiting performance on ID data. This study introduces COOkeD, a heterogeneous ensemble combining closed-world, zero-shot CLIP, and linear probe classifiers. Despite its modular and post-hoc nature, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. It shows robustness against label noise, covariate shift, and zero-shot shift scenarios, often overlooked in previous studies. By leveraging pre-trained VLMs, COOkeD introduces minimal overhead compared to standard classifier training. The availability of code on GitHub facilitates the adoption of COOkeD in image recognition tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.22576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier, leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier. We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various forms of unseen image degradation.

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model, which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

arXiv:2507.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary: 
The article introduces GALTraj, a method for improving data-driven trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems. Unlike previous approaches that modified model architectures, GALTraj refines the training process to enhance the model's performance without structural changes. By deploying generative active learning, GALTraj actively identifies and augments rare tail samples where the model fails during training. The method focuses on generating diverse, realistic scenarios that preserve rare behaviors and traffic rules. Unlike previous simulation methods, GALTraj's tail-aware generation approach leverages tailored diffusion guidance to benefit long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experimental results on multiple trajectory datasets with popular backbones demonstrate significant performance improvements on tail samples and enhanced accuracy on head samples. GALTraj showcases the potential of simulator-driven augmentation for improving trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br /> Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams, deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality, addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.

<div> Keywords: 3D point cloud segmentation, data augmentation, semantic labels, scene synthesis, graph-guided framework

Summary:
Our proposed graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints aims to improve 3D point cloud segmentation by considering both local and global structural dependencies within scenes. By constructing guiding graphs based on real-world object relationship statistics, our method enforces geometric plausibility and semantic consistency at the local level while maintaining the topological structure of the scene at the global level. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models. <div>

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation. Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others, highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.

<title>Image-Guided Shape-from-Template Using Mesh Inextensibility Constraints</title>

arXiv:2507.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the 3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template. Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover, when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/dvttran/nsft.

<title>A Linear N-Point Solver for Structure and Motion from Asynchronous Tracks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at https://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples, thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components. Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the TestA set.

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching, exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps. Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds, attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information (past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available at: https://github.com/donglihe-hub/FetalCLIP-IQA.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

arXiv:2507.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

arXiv:2507.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years, geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution, as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic parameter estimation in clinical practice.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces. In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen generators.

arXiv:2507.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm. Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout. Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference. Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

<title>CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.

<title>TR-PTS: Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection for Efficient Tuning</title>

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%, respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore, we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on other related tasks.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&amp;E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans, with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy, particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available. This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation, enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact, lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions, revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions, including CE, C\&amp;W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and robustness evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity, demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

<title>Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework</title>

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems, as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs, bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame, resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper, we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery. Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia communication and storage systems.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks. However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture, enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a 1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 69.1%.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Low-Cost-Accurate-Radar-Based-Human-Motion-Direction-Determination.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work, we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models (VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs. We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back, compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF) module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%, respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation, achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a powerful and popular technique for personalization, enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained image generation models for specific tasks without comprehensive retraining. While employing individual pre-trained LoRA models excels at representing single concepts, such as those representing a specific dog or a cat, utilizing multiple LoRA models to capture a variety of concepts in a single image still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). We introduce CLoRA, a training-free approach that addresses these limitations by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models at test-time, and leveraging the attention maps to create semantic masks for fusing latent representations. This enables the generation of composite images that accurately reflect the characteristics of each LoRA. Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that CLoRA significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-concept image generation using LoRAs.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: Standard convolutions are prevalent in image processing and deep learning, but their fixed kernels limits adaptability. Several deformation strategies of the reference kernel grid have been proposed. Yet, they lack a unified theoretical framework. By returning to a metric perspective for images, now seen as two-dimensional manifolds equipped with notions of local and geodesic distances, either symmetric (Riemannian) or not (Finsler), we provide a unifying principle: the kernel positions are samples of unit balls of implicit metrics. With this new perspective, we also propose metric convolutions, a novel approach that samples unit balls from explicit signal-dependent metrics, providing interpretable operators with geometric regularisation. This framework, compatible with gradient-based optimisation, can directly replace existing convolutions applied to either input images or deep features of neural networks. Metric convolutions typically require fewer parameters and provide better generalisation. Our approach shows competitive performance in standard denoising and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, specialized computer vision techniques, notably transformers grounded in attention mechanisms and residual networks employing skip connections, have been instrumental in advancing performance. Nonetheless, previous models often falter when segmenting small, irregularly shaped tumors. To this end, we introduce SMAFormer, an efficient, Transformer-based architecture that fuses multiple attention mechanisms for enhanced segmentation of small tumors and organs. SMAFormer can capture both local and global features for medical image segmentation. The architecture comprises two pivotal components. First, a Synergistic Multi-Attention (SMA) Transformer block is proposed, which has the benefits of Pixel Attention, Channel Attention, and Spatial Attention for feature enrichment. Second, addressing the challenge of information loss incurred during attention mechanism transitions and feature fusion, we design a Feature Fusion Modulator. This module bolsters the integration between the channel and spatial attention by mitigating reshaping-induced information attrition. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/CXH-Research/SMAFormer.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in caption generation, existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the full quality or fine-grained details of captions. This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities. Source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/pacscore.

Abstract: Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are largely limited to processing short, seconds-long videos and struggle with generating coherent descriptions for extended video spanning minutes or more. Long video description introduces new challenges, such as consistent character identification and plot-level descriptions incorporating both visual and audio information. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create StoryQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on StoryQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on StoryQA.

Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Motion controllability is crucial in video synthesis. However, most previous methods are limited to single control types, and combining them often results in logical conflicts. In this paper, we propose a disentangled and unified framework, namely I2VControl, to overcome the logical conflicts. We rethink camera control, object dragging, and motion brush, reformulating all tasks into a consistent representation based on point trajectories, each managed by a dedicated formulation. Accordingly, we propose a spatial partitioning strategy, where each unit is assigned to a concomitant control category, enabling diverse control types to be dynamically orchestrated within a single synthesis pipeline without conflicts. Furthermore, we design an adapter structure that functions as a plug-in for pre-trained models and is agnostic to specific model architectures. We conduct extensive experiments, achieving excellent performance on various control tasks, and our method further facilitates user-driven creative combinations, enhancing innovation and creativity.

Abstract: Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.

Abstract: We introduce FOF-X for real-time reconstruction of detailed human geometry from a single image. Balancing real-time speed against high-quality results is a persistent challenge, mainly due to the high computational demands of existing 3D representations. To address this, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), an efficient 3D representation by learning the Fourier series. The core of FOF is to factorize a 3D occupancy field into a 2D vector field, retaining topology and spatial relationships within the 3D domain while facilitating compatibility with 2D convolutional neural networks. Such a representation bridges the gap between 3D and 2D domains, enabling the integration of human parametric models as priors and enhancing the reconstruction robustness. Based on FOF, we design a new reconstruction framework, FOF-X, to avoid the performance degradation caused by texture and lighting. This enables our real-time reconstruction system to better handle the domain gap between training images and real images. Additionally, in FOF-X, we enhance the inter-conversion algorithms between FOF and mesh representations with a Laplacian constraint and an automaton-based discontinuity matcher, improving both quality and robustness. We validate the strengths of our approach on different datasets and real-captured data, where FOF-X achieves new state-of-the-art results. The code has already been released for research purposes at https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/FOFX/index.html.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective receptive field $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/suous/RecNeXt.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interaction motions is a critical problem in VR/AR and human animation. Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have become a promising approach to enhancing perception and decision-making in autonomous driving. The gap remains in applying VLMs to understand complex scenarios interacting with pedestrians and efficient vehicle deployment. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge from large-scale vision-language foundation models to efficient vision networks, and we apply it to pedestrian behavior prediction and scene understanding tasks, achieving promising results in generating more diverse and comprehensive semantic attributes. We also utilize multiple pre-trained models and ensemble techniques to boost the model's performance. We further examined the effectiveness of the model after knowledge distillation; the results show significant metric improvements in open-vocabulary perception and trajectory prediction tasks, which can potentially enhance the end-to-end performance of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with preference optimization is valuable for human-annotated datasets, but the heavy cost of manual data collection limits scalability. Using reward models offers an alternative, however, current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information, as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore, they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this, we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO), a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally, we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally, we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair. Experimental results show that CaPO consistently outperforms prior methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in both single and multi-reward settings validated by evaluation on T2I benchmarks, including GenEval and T2I-Compbench.

Abstract: Astronauts take thousands of photos of Earth per day from the International Space Station, which, once localized on Earth's surface, are used for a multitude of tasks, ranging from climate change research to disaster management. The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.

Abstract: The complex application scenarios have raised critical requirements for precise and generalizable gaze estimation methods. Recently, the pre-trained CLIP has achieved remarkable performance on various vision tasks, but its potentials have not been fully exploited in gaze estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel Differential Contrastive Training strategy, which boosts gaze estimation performance with the help of the CLIP. Accordingly, a Differential Contrastive Gaze Estimation network (DCGaze) composed of a Visual Appearance-aware branch and a Semantic Differential-aware branch is introduced. The Visual Appearance-aware branch is essentially a primary gaze estimation network and it incorporates an Adaptive Feature-refinement Unit (AFU) and a Double-head Gaze Regressor (DGR), which both help the primary network to extract informative and gaze-related appearance features. Moreover, the Semantic Difference-aware branch is designed on the basis of the CLIP's text encoder to reveal the semantic difference of gazes. This branch could further empower the Visual Appearance-aware branch with the capability of characterizing the gaze-related semantic information. Extensive experimental results on four challenging datasets over within and cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCGaze.The code is available at https://github.com/LinZhang-bjtu/DCGaze.

Abstract: The advancement of remote sensing, including satellite systems, facilitates the continuous acquisition of remote sensing imagery globally, introducing novel challenges for achieving open-world tasks. Deployed models need to continuously adjust to a constant influx of new data, which frequently exhibits diverse shifts from the data encountered during the training phase. To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update their parameters without forgetting learned knowledge, as has been considered in works on a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing studies are typically conducted within a single dataset to simulate realistic conditions, with a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenEarthSensing (OES)}, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OES includes 189 scene and object categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, to provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance, OES encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domains, one RGB aerial domain, one multispectral RGB domain, and one infrared domain. We evaluate the baselines and existing methods for diverse tasks on OES, demonstrating that it serves as a meaningful and challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing. The proposed dataset OES is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/OES.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have made impressive strides in image captioning, VQA, and video comprehension, yet they still struggle with the intricate temporal and spatial cues found in comics. To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.

Abstract: Visual Mamba networks (ViMs) extend the selective state space model (Mamba) to various vision tasks and demonstrate significant potential. As a promising compression technique, vector quantization (VQ) decomposes network weights into codebooks and assignments, significantly reducing memory usage and computational latency, thereby enabling the deployment of ViMs on edge devices. Although existing VQ methods have achieved extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit) in convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based networks, directly applying these methods to ViMs results in unsatisfactory accuracy. We identify several key challenges: 1) The weights of Mamba-based blocks in ViMs contain numerous outliers, significantly amplifying quantization errors. 2) When applied to ViMs, the latest VQ methods suffer from excessive memory consumption, lengthy calibration procedures, and suboptimal performance in the search for optimal codewords. In this paper, we propose ViM-VQ, an efficient post-training vector quantization method tailored for ViMs. ViM-VQ consists of two innovative components: 1) a fast convex combination optimization algorithm that efficiently updates both the convex combinations and the convex hulls to search for optimal codewords, and 2) an incremental vector quantization strategy that incrementally confirms optimal codewords to mitigate truncation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ViM-VQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit quantization across various visual tasks.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) has become a cornerstone in modern computer graphics, enabling realistic material representation and lighting interactions in 3D scenes. In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D/4D scene generation emphasizes the importance of physical alignment throughout video generation and scene reconstruction. However, existing methods improve the alignment separately at each stage, making it difficult to manage subtle misalignments arising from another stage. Here, we present SteerX, a zero-shot inference-time steering method that unifies scene reconstruction into the generation process, tilting data distributions toward better geometric alignment. To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SteerX in improving 3D/4D scene generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces Gaussian on-the-fly Splatting (abbreviated as On-the-Fly GS), a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via On-the-Fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. To achieve this, we propose a progressive Local & Semi-Global optimization to prioritize the new image and its neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across previous and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering one of the first practical steps toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, the integration of roadside perception systems is essential for overcoming occlusion challenges and enhancing the safety of Vulnerable Road Users(VRUs). While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across 150 traffic scenarios, with 7 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking. The dataset and the code for reproducing our evaluation results are made publicly available.

<title>Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.

<title>Fine-Tuning Visual Autoregressive Models for Subject-Driven Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have enabled numerous practical applications, including subject-driven generation, which fine-tunes pretrained models to capture subject semantics from only a few examples. While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive (VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, naive fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize minor details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.

<title>STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints</title>

Abstract: Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of , a sketch of a ). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .

<title>Enhancing Multimodal In-Context Learning for Image Classification through Coreset Optimization</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, using a few demonstrations from a large support set. However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.

<title>VistaDepth: Frequency Modulation with Bias Reweighting for Enhanced Far-range Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation predicts per-pixel depth from a single RGB image. While recent methods have shown promise by leveraging diffusion models, they often struggle to accurately reconstruct far-range regions. This difficulty stems from two compounding factors. First, the standard spatially uniform diffusion objective fails to adapt to the varying frequency content across a depth map. Second, the long-tail depth distribution heavily biases models toward near-range regions. To address these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework named for its ability to accurately reconstruct far-range vistas, which integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature processing with an adaptive loss-balancing mechanism into the diffusion pipeline. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, effectively preserving structural detail. Additionally, we introduce BiasMap, a mechanism that applies adaptive weights directly to the diffusion loss in the latent space, focusing supervision on under-represented far-range regions. These innovations collectively achieve superior depth perception performance across near- and far-range depths while preserving fine detail. Experiments show that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based MDE, particularly excelling in reconstructing detailed and accurate depth in far-range regions.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.

Abstract: The success of face recognition (FR) systems has led to serious privacy concerns due to potential unauthorized surveillance and user tracking on social networks. Existing methods for enhancing privacy fail to generate natural face images that can protect facial privacy. In this paper, we propose diffusion-based adversarial identity manipulation (DiffAIM) to generate natural and highly transferable adversarial faces against malicious FR systems. To be specific, we manipulate facial identity within the low-dimensional latent space of a diffusion model. This involves iteratively injecting gradient-based adversarial identity guidance during the reverse diffusion process, progressively steering the generation toward the desired adversarial faces. The guidance is optimized for identity convergence towards a target while promoting semantic divergence from the source, facilitating effective impersonation while maintaining visual naturalness. We further incorporate structure-preserving regularization to preserve facial structure consistency during manipulation. Extensive experiments on both face verification and identification tasks demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, DiffAIM achieves stronger black-box attack transferability while maintaining superior visual quality. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for commercial FR APIs, including Face++ and Aliyun.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of diffusion-based malicious image manipulation, existing proactive defense methods struggle to safeguard images against tampering under unknown conditions. To address this, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense approach that achieves protection comprising three novel modules. First, we introduce a multi-level deep feature extractor to obtain intricate features from the diffusion denoising process, enhancing protective effectiveness. Second, we design a multi-scale, semantic-preserving data augmentation technique to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions. Finally, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to bolster protection against manipulations guided by diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments on InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that Anti-Inpainting effectively defends against diffusion-based inpainters under unknown conditions. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness against various image purification methods and transferability across different diffusion model versions.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has emerged as a crucial research direction, as integrating textual and visual information can substantially enhance performance in tasks such as classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. Despite advances with large pre-trained models, existing approaches often suffer from insufficient cross-modal interactions and rigid fusion strategies, failing to fully harness the complementary strengths of different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Co-AttenDWG, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and expert fusion. Our approach first projects textual and visual features into a shared embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities. This is further strengthened by a dimension-wise gating network, which adaptively modulates feature contributions at the channel level to emphasize salient information. In parallel, dual-path encoders independently refine modality-specific representations, while an additional cross-attention layer aligns the modalities further. The resulting features are aggregated via an expert fusion module that integrates learned gating and self-attention, yielding a robust unified representation. Experimental results on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0 datasets show that Co-AttenDWG achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior cross-modal alignment, highlighting its effectiveness for diverse multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Abstract: The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process. Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input pieces are non-overlapped.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A recent diffusion-based approach avoids this by generating human-oriented images from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. However, it utilizes a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce the computational cost, selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses a single random seed without selection, across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to person identification using hand images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is particularly valuable in serious crimes such as sexual abuse, where hand images are often the only identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method, CLIP-HandID, leverages a pre-trained foundational vision-language model - CLIP - to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature representations from hand images (input to CLIP's image encoder) using textual prompts as semantic guidance. Since hand images are labeled with indexes rather than text descriptions, we employ a textual inversion network to learn pseudo-tokens that encode specific visual contexts or appearance attributes. These learned pseudo-tokens are then incorporated into textual prompts, which are fed into CLIP's text encoder to leverage its multi-modal reasoning and enhance generalization for identification. Through extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with multi-ethnic representation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts. The project is available at GitHub.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration. Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/SIED.

<title>StruMamba3D: Exploring Structural Mamba for Self-supervised Point Cloud Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits. First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap.

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall. Our code is accessible at \href{https://github.com/Laka-3DV/TurboReg}{\texttt{TurboReg}}.

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o \underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection. 3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%, and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA, respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images. These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and exploration for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward approaches, driven by deep learning, have revolutionized this field by enabling fast and generalizable 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. This survey offers a comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics, and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance the state of the art in 3D vision.

<title>Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models</title>

arXiv:2402.00186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers

<title>Beyond Image Prior: Embedding Noise Prior into Conditional Denoising Transformer</title>

arXiv:2407.09094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning-based denoising methods typically train models to generalize the image prior from large-scale datasets, suffering from the variability in noise distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/YuanfeiHuang/Condformer.

<title>Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer</title>

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.

Abstract: Ring artifacts are prevalent in 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) due to non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors, substantially affecting image quality and diagnostic reliability. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ring artifact reduction (RAR) methods rely on supervised learning with large-scale paired CT datasets. While effective in-domain, supervised methods tend to struggle to fully capture the physical characteristics of ring artifacts, leading to pronounced performance drops in complex real-world acquisitions. Moreover, their scalability to 3D CBCT is limited by high memory demands. In this work, we propose Riner, a new unsupervised RAR method. Based on a theoretical analysis of ring artifact formation, we reformulate RAR as a multi-parameter inverse problem, where the non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors are parameterized as solvable physical variables. Using a new differentiable forward model, Riner can jointly learn the implicit neural representation of artifact-free images and estimate the physical parameters directly from CT measurements, without external training data. Additionally, Riner is memory-friendly due to its ray-based optimization, enhancing its usability in large-scale 3D CBCT. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show Riner outperforms existing SOTA supervised methods.

arXiv:2501.06838v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INR) have been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and low computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ChrisDud0257/GSASR.

Abstract: Effective segmentation is fundamental for quantitative medical imaging; however, foundation segmentation models remain insufficiently evaluated for accuracy and biomarker fidelity across the diverse anatomical contexts and imaging protocols encountered in musculoskeletal (MSK) MRI. We evaluate three widely used segmentation models (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) across eleven MSK MRI datasets spanning the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, and thigh. Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis. The framework offers a transparent method for benchmarking segmentation tools and connecting model performance to clinical imaging priorities.

arXiv:2501.15831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives:  High classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI has been achieved using deep neural networks, yet the specific image features contributing to these decisions remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were systematically assessed.
  Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied through skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape contributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each configuration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral clustering of relevance maps.
  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing conditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance, indicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric features -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping -- were consistently used by the models.
  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where preprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues. The resulting Clever Hans effect emphasizes the critical importance of interpretability tools to reveal hidden biases and to ensure robust and trustworthy deep learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual-to-audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multimodal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements in LSE and FID score. Our code is available at https://github.com/Peter-SungwooCho/MAVFlow.

Abstract: This study presents Flower Pose Estimation (FloPE), a real-time flower pose estimation framework for computationally constrained robotic pollination systems. Robotic pollination has been proposed to supplement natural pollination to ensure global food security due to the decreased population of natural pollinators. However, flower pose estimation for pollination is challenging due to natural variability, flower clusters, and high accuracy demands due to the flowers' fragility when pollinating. This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of FloPE, achieving up to 78.75% pollination success rate and outperforming prior robotic pollination techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.

Abstract: We present TartanGround, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset to advance the perception and autonomy of ground robots operating in diverse environments. This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments, resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks, including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation, perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks, have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions. Our code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/CLUDI.

<div> evolves, data, model, multimodal, reasoning 
Summary:
C2-Evo is introduced as an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework for enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through joint evolution of training data and model capabilities. This framework addresses core challenges faced by existing self-improving models, such as discrepancies in data complexity and mismatched difficulty levels between tasks and models. C2-Evo operates through two evolution loops: a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems combining structured textual sub-problems with geometric diagrams, while the latter adaptively selects and fine-tunes generated problems based on the model's performance. This iterative refinement process results in significant performance gains across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The code, models, and datasets associated with C2-Evo are set to be released, allowing for further research and implementation in the field of multimodal large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers, enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation, and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Summary:
BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction) is introduced as a zero-shot approach for pedestrian intention prediction in autonomous driving. It leverages short, continuous video clips with structured JAAD metadata to infer crossing intentions. Unlike GPT-4V methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips and incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed through multimodal prompts. Despite not requiring additional training, BF-PIP achieves a 73% prediction accuracy, surpassing a GPT-4V baseline by 18%. This approach showcases the effectiveness of combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues in enhancing spatiotemporal perception and improving intent inference in ambiguous conditions. BF-PIP's performance highlights the potential for an agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation system.

The ChartM3 benchmark is presented, featuring 1,000 samples with varying levels of editing difficulty and assessing visual appearance and code correctness. Current large language models, including GPT-4o, struggle with interpreting and acting on visual indicators, as revealed by the benchmark. To address this, the ChartM3-Train dataset with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples is created for fine-tuning of MLLMs, leading to significant improvements in practical chart editing systems.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.

Summary:
This study focuses on explaining how Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) integrate visual and language information to generate captions. Traditional metrics may not provide deep insights into this integration. The researchers propose a novel explanation framework based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs), combining symbolic rules with real-valued functions. The framework hypothesizes how relevant training examples influence caption generation. By learning a HMLN distribution over training instances and inferring shifts in distributions when conditioning on generated samples, the researchers can quantify the influence of specific examples on captions. Experiments with state-of-the-art captioning models and Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate the interpretability of the explanations, enabling the comparison of models based on explainability. <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare these models along the dimension of explainability.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

Summary: 
Aerial wildlife tracking is crucial for conservation efforts, but detecting small objects from aircraft poses challenges. This research explores the use of patching augmentation to enhance model performance in small object detection. Three different object detectors were compared using various patching configurations, with all models achieving a high accuracy of at least 93% mAP@IoU=0.5. Statistical analyses revealed insights into the impact of different factors on detection accuracy. Surprisingly, simpler and faster models performed just as well as more complex models, indicating the feasibility of using UAVs for this task. The study emphasizes the importance of computational efficiency in aerial wildlife tracking and provides datasets and models for further research on GitHub at https://github.com/chrisindris/Moose.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment. Datasets and models will be made available via https://github.com/chrisindris/Moose.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach utilizing the Latent Diffusion Model for estimating HDR environment maps from a single-view image. The proposed method addresses common issues such as distortions at the poles and seam artefacts at the sides of the environment map by incorporating ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. By introducing the panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture, the researchers investigate the impact of adapting the diffusion network to the ERP format on the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map. The PanoDiT network successfully reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, although there is a trade-off with image quality and plausibility. Evaluation using standard benchmarks indicates that the models produce high-quality environment maps that are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and lighting accuracy. <div>

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation, the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and lighting accuracy.

Summary: 
CLIP-based models have shown strong performance in natural image-text domains, leading to their adaptation in medical tasks like chest X-ray classification. This study evaluates six CLIP-based models using three datasets and assesses their fairness and robustness. Performance gaps were observed between patients of different ages, but equitable results were seen across other attributes.

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally, we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

<div> Keywords: Virtual 3D meetings, 2D webcam feed, authenticity, stability loss, videoconferencing<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new method for predicting 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real-time from a single 2D webcam feed. This method aims to enhance copresence and engagement in virtual 3D meetings by creating realistic and authentic 3D representations of individuals. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, the reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from different viewpoints, ensuring authenticity. The introduction of a stability loss further improves the temporal stability of the reconstructions on video sequences. The method outperforms existing solutions in visual quality and stability metrics and allows for live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This approach democratizes volumetric communication, making 3D videoconferencing accessible, realistic, and authentic. <div>

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware, making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically, via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but also realistic and authentic.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework for accurate segmentation of tubular structures, particularly in medical imaging. The framework includes an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module that simultaneously learns global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps to target local discontinuity regions while maintaining global integrity. Additionally, a Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module refines the segmentation maps for improved accuracy. Experimental results on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that GLCP outperforms existing methods in accuracy and continuity of tubular structure segmentation. Source codes for the framework will be available on GitHub at the provided link. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically, we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively. This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

<div> Keywords: Visual Question Answering, Vision Language Models, Grice's maxims, modifiers, limitations

Summary:
In this study, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is examined as a conversation between humans and AI systems, exploring the sensitivity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of Grice's cooperative principles. The researchers investigate how VLMs handle violations of Grice's maxims by introducing modifiers to questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset and analyzing the responses of three advanced VLMs: GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Flash. Their findings suggest that the performance of VLMs decreases consistently when modifiers are added, indicating a potential limitation in their understanding of complex conversational nuances. This approach offers insights into the capabilities and boundaries of VLMs in processing multimodal conversations, aligning with human cognitive processing of communication nuances. Further exploration of these limitations could enhance the development and refinement of VLMs for more effective and nuanced communication in the future.

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort. Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality. However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans. Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18 subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it more suitable for real-time clinical applications.

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets (AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Summary:
Collaborative Perceiver (CoP) is a new multi-task learning framework designed for vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection in autonomous driving. It focuses on incorporating spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to enhance environmental context understanding. The framework generates dense occupancy ground truths with local density information, utilizes voxel-height-guided sampling for fine-grained feature extraction, and implements a global-local collaborative feature fusion module for robust BEV representations. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark show that CoP outperforms existing frameworks with a 49.5% mAP and 59.2% NDS on the test set. By bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement, CoP offers a more comprehensive perception of the physical world in autonomous driving scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework (PDAF) for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) to address domain shifts in unseen environments. PDAF incorporates a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and enhance feature alignment. The framework consists of three modules: Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts LDP, Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations, and Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) estimates LDP without paired samples. This iterative process effectively models domain shifts, refining feature representations for improved generalization in complex target conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of PDAF in diverse urban scenes. <div>

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and challenging urban scenes.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics. This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Unlike existing approaches that require instruction-following data for fine-tuning, LLaVA-Reward directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs with text-image pairs, eliminating the need for time-consuming training. The incorporation of Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting visual features with hidden representations. LLaVA-Reward supports various types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired and unpaired data. Trained on four evaluation perspectives, it outperforms conventional methods in generating human-aligned scores and scaling in text-to-image generations. <div>

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, training efficiency, token pruning, reference-guided adaptive token elision, teacher-student framework

Summary: 
ReGATE is introduced as an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating the training of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It utilizes a teacher-student framework where a reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher and the MLLM being trained as the student. By combining per-token reference losses with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's difficulty scores, ReGATE selectively processes essential tokens during the forward pass, reducing computational overhead significantly. Experimental results show that applying ReGATE to VideoLLaMA2 achieves peak accuracy on MVBench up to twice as fast as standard training, using only 35% of the tokens. Moreover, with further training, ReGATE surpasses the baseline on various multimodal benchmarks while reducing the total token count by more than 41%. The code and models for ReGATE will be made available soon. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous driving, Bird's-Eye View encoders, MapDiffusion, Uncertainty estimation, HD map construction <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces MapDiffusion, a novel approach for generating multiple plausible vectorized maps by leveraging the diffusion paradigm. Unlike traditional models that provide deterministic point estimates, MapDiffusion captures uncertainty and ambiguity in real-world environments. By iteratively refining randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, MapDiffusion generates multiple map samples, improving prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that MapDiffusion outperforms baseline methods by 5% in single-sample performance. Aggregating multiple samples enhances performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. The uncertainty estimates produced by MapDiffusion are particularly useful in identifying ambiguous regions with occlusions. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the reliability and robustness of online HD map construction for autonomous vehicles, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making in complex environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.

Summary:
The study introduces a new Dual Cross-Image Semantic Consistency (DuCiSC) learning framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. It addresses limitations of current approaches by focusing on region-level semantic consistency and balancing labeled and unlabeled data through dual paradigms. DuCiSC aligns prototypes to establish cross-image semantics and mitigate feature discrepancy issues. A self-aware confidence estimation strategy is also introduced to select reliable pseudo labels from unlabeled data for training. The effectiveness of DuCiSC is validated on various medical image segmentation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code for DuCiSC is publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al \underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic \underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DuCiSC}{https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DuCiSC}.

<div> Keywords: Vision Language Navigation, Recursive Visual Imagination, Adaptive Linguistic Grounding, navigation policy, semantic matching

Summary:
Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) is proposed to summarize visual perceptions along navigation trajectories, focusing on semantic scene layouts. Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) aligns learned memories with linguistic components for accurate navigation anticipation. The navigation policy outperforms existing methods on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of RVI and ALG techniques for Vision Language Navigation. The approach addresses challenges of overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, enhancing linguistic grounding and improving navigational decision-making. By structurally modeling historical trajectories and purposefully aligning situational memories with language, the proposed techniques enable agents to better understand high-level scene priors and adhere to linguistic commands during navigation in unknown environments. <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance.

<div> Keywords: 4D light field representation, angular feature modeling, object tracking, low-light scenes, geometric structure 

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel light field representation called the epipolar-plane structure image (ESI), which enhances visual expression in low-light scenes and reduces redundancy in high-dimensional light fields by capturing the geometric structure within the light field. An angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) is proposed for light field object tracking, learning angular-aware representations and optimizing in a self-supervised manner to improve geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. A large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking is introduced. Experiments show that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking and is effective for multiple object tracking, demonstrating the importance of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.

Summary: 
DAC framework combines CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for open-set 3D object retrieval using only multi-view images. The MLLM describes seen category information for adaptation during training and provides external hints about unknown objects during inference. An Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA) improves synergy and generalization. DAC outperforms existing methods by an average of +10.01% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Generalization is confirmed on image-based and cross-dataset setups. The code for DAC is available on GitHub at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient. Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

The paper introduces a model called Chain-of-Cooking for visualizing the cooking process, addressing challenges in generating images for each step of a recipe. The Dynamic Patch Selection Module retrieves relevant image patches for correct ingredient appearances, while the Semantic Evolution Module maintains coherence by associating latent prompts with the current step. The Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought Guidance ensures rational order by updating features based on previous steps. A dataset named CookViz is also introduced, containing image-text pairs for intermediate cooking process steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating coherent and semantically consistent cooking process visualizations. <div>
arXiv:2507.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

<div> deepfake detection, online synthesized forgeries, gradient conflicts, Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
The study addresses the issue of degraded performance in deepfake detection models when jointly training on original and online synthesized forgeries. Through empirical analysis, the researchers identify gradient conflicts during backpropagation as the cause of this degradation. To overcome this challenge, they propose the Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework, consisting of two modules: Update Vector Search (UVS) and Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR). The UVS module searches for an alternative update vector to reconcile disparities between data types, while the CGR module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. The synergy of UVS and CGR aims to alleviate gradient interference in parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization. <div>
arXiv:2507.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

<div> Sun sensor, spacecraft attitude, calibration algorithms, uncertainties, modeling techniques 

Summary: 
Sun sensors are crucial for determining spacecraft attitude, with calibration being a complex process due to various uncertainties. These uncertainties, spanning manufacturing, environmental, and interference sources, necessitate advanced calibration algorithms to reduce error and enhance accuracy over the sensor's lifecycle. Despite extensive research on modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors, there is a lack of a consolidated resource for this information. This review aims to systematically map out the existing algorithms for sun sensor modeling and calibration across different sensor configurations. By providing a comprehensive survey of each methodology, identifying research gaps, and suggesting future research directions, this review aims to enhance the understanding and application of sun sensor calibration in spacecraft technology. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

<div> hallucination, multimodal large language models, preference optimization, grounding, causally relevant visual information

Summary:
TARS introduces a token-adaptive preference strategy for multimodal large language models to reduce hallucinations in vision-language reasoning. By reformulating preference optimization as a min-max problem, TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts while minimizing expected preference loss to maintain causal grounding and mitigate overfitting. The approach simulates alignment uncertainty and reduces dependency on superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to improved model reliability. With only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS achieves a significant reduction in hallucination rates and cognition value, outperforming standard preference optimization methods and matching GPT-4o on key metrics. <div>
arXiv:2507.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

<div> latent diffusion model, face aging, personalized aging, local aging signs, identity preservation

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to face aging that overcomes the limitations of current methods by considering facial aging as a local, heterogeneous process. Unlike existing techniques that condition generation on a reference image and target age, this approach leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions based on local aging signs. By blending these locally aged regions seamlessly with a latent diffusion refiner, the method ensures a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and enables a natural, controllable aging progression. This finer-grained control over the generation process allows for more personalized face aging simulations, enhancing the overall quality and realism of the generated aged faces. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process, enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging: robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a natural, controllable aging progression.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised tracking, spatio-temporal consistency, instance contrastive loss, benchmark datasets, generic tracking representations <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new self-supervised tracking framework, called \textbf{{\tracker}}, that aims to eliminate the need for manual box annotations in tracking datasets. The framework utilizes a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training approach to learn target information across timestamps effectively. It also incorporates an instance contrastive loss to learn instance-level correspondences from multiple perspectives, providing robust instance supervision without additional labels. By simulating appearance and motion variations in real-world scenarios, \textbf{{\tracker}} can learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, reducing the reliance on extensive box annotations. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that \textbf{{\tracker}} outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised tracking methods, achieving significant improvements in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets. The code for \textbf{{\tracker}} is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions, outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative medicine and related fields.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades, accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting, turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

<div> Keywords: Industrial anomaly detection, multimodal large language models, difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization, few-shot anomaly detection, MMAD benchmark

Summary:
Industrial anomaly detection is crucial for manufacturing systems' safety and reliability. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), while strong in vision-language reasoning, lack effectiveness in this area without domain-specific adaptation. To address this gap, the EMIT framework is proposed, enhancing MLLMs with difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT uses GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images and integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings for few-shot anomaly detection. The difficulty-aware GRPO extends the original GRPO by including response resampling and advantage reweighting mechanisms to handle challenging data samples. Experimental results on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate EMIT's significant improvement in IAD performance, with an average increase of 7.77% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Summary: 
GuidPaint introduces a novel approach to image inpainting by incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process. This framework enables precise control over intermediate generations within masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. By integrating stochastic and deterministic sampling, users can select preferred intermediate results and refine them deterministically. Unlike existing context-aware inpainting methods, GuidPaint does not require additional training or architectural modifications, reducing computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint outperforms current methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The framework allows for fine-grained control over masked regions, addressing issues of semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. Overall, GuidPaint offers a training-free, class-guided approach to image inpainting that achieves high-quality results with efficient computation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

Summary:
Adaptive Path Tracing (APT) addresses issues encountered in patch-based approaches for high-resolution image generation. The framework combines Statistical Matching to maintain consistency in patch distributions during the upsampling of latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to handle patch monotonicity. APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images, improving inference speed with minimal quality degradation through a shortcut denoising process. By tackling "patch-level distribution shift" and "increased patch monotonicity," APT enhances the quality and efficiency of high-resolution image generation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of APT, demonstrating its practicality for producing detailed outputs at faster sampling rates. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions, limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.

<div> Privacy concerns in medical imaging pose challenges for re-identification (ReID), leading to the need for de-identification (DeID) techniques. Current DeID methods do not adequately preserve medical semantics or adjust to different privacy levels. To address these issues, a divide-and-conquer framework is proposed, involving Identity Blocking and Medical Semantics Compensation steps. This framework blocks identity-related regions to achieve varying privacy levels and leverages pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic features and compensate for blocked regions. A feature decoupling strategy based on the Minimum Description Length principle is introduced to effectively eliminate residual identity information in MFM features. Extensive evaluations across seven datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework.<br /><br />Summary:

2. Existing DeID methods do not adequately preserve medical semantics or adjust to varying privacy levels.
3. The proposed framework includes Identity Blocking and Medical Semantics Compensation steps.
4. Pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) are utilized to extract medical semantic features and compensate for blocked regions.

arXiv:2507.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and efficiency in critical applications.

<div> Keywords: Visual Object Tracking, SAMITE model, Prototypical Memory Bank, Positional Prompt Generator, Benchmark evaluation

Summary: 
The article introduces a new Visual Object Tracking (VOT) method called SAMITE, which addresses issues of object occlusions and distractions in tracking. SAMITE builds upon the SAM2 model and includes additional modules such as the Prototypical Memory Bank and Positional Prompt Generator. The Prototypical Memory Bank quantifies the correctness of tracking results and filters out frames with inaccurate features to prevent error propagation. The Positional Prompt Generator generates positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, improving tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAMITE in comparison to existing methods. The code for SAMITE is also made available on GitHub for further research and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal learning, MAGE, Alignment mechanism, Intelligent Alignment Network, Large model architecture<br />
Summary:<br />
In the field of multimodal learning, the integration of visual and textual data often faces challenges related to spatial and semantic losses. The proposed framework, MAGE, addresses these challenges by introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN) to achieve dimensional and semantic alignment between vision and text. By employing a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, MAGE reduces the gap between heterogeneous data and enhances alignment effects. Additionally, MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability is enhanced through the development of a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions. The proposed multimodal large model architecture outperforms existing works across multiple evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. The complete code and appendix for MAGE are available on GitHub at https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

<title>Adversarial Reconstruction Feedback for Robust Fine-grained Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21742</link>

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently, the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

<title>Few-Shot Vision-Language Reasoning for Satellite Imagery via Verifiable Rewards</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21745</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<title>LiteFat: Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning for Real-Time Driver Fatigue Detection</title>

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

<title>AU-LLM: Micro-Expression Action Unit Detection via Enhanced LLM-Based Feature Fusion</title>

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level (local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore, recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization, achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at: \href{https://github.com/Rain-Bus/MSGCoOp}{https://github.com/Rain-Bus/MSGCoOp}.

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context. These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the `appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally `observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

<title>Anyone Can Jailbreak: Prompt-Based Attacks on LLMs and T2Is</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort, high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models, grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

<title>Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression</title>

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation, where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules, architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

<title>Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2507.21857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD. Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19 state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead, offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<title>CAPE: A CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble of Complementary Heatmap Cues for Embodied Reference Understanding</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency, further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and immersive storytelling experiences.

Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC: 0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI deployment in pathology.

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic, contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.

<title>SwinECAT: A Transformer-based fundus disease classification model with Shifted Window Attention and Efficient Channel Attention</title>

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category classification on this public dataset.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models. However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

<title>Attention-Driven Multimodal Alignment for Long-term Action Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories: unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network (LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion. Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

<title>Enhancing Generalization in Data-free Quantization via Mixup-class Prompting</title>

arXiv:2507.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore, it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.

<title>Contrast-Prior Enhanced Duality for Mask-Free Shadow Removal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues, such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based methods.

<title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Cross-architecture Consistency Regularization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21959</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve pseudo mask quality.

<title>PanoSplatt3R: Leveraging Perspective Pretraining for Generalized Unposed Wide-Baseline Panorama Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise. These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs. These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras, which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense, semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module (MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis. However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

arXiv:2507.21985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation. Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for previously attacked unlearned concepts.

arXiv:2507.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small `trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of 0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex, data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/oliviadzy/ViHallu.

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric, caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii) a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid (motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

<title>XAI for Point Cloud Data using Perturbations based on Meaningful Segmentation</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics.

<title>Shallow Deep Learning Can Still Excel in Fine-Grained Few-Shot Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks. Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our conjecture.

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time, semantics-aware Spatial AI.

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects, yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning (MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

<title>X-Omni: Reinforcement Learning Makes Discrete Autoregressive Image Generative Models Great Again</title>

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction'' paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

<title>StepAL: Step-aware Active Learning for Cataract Surgical Videos</title>

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets (Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing computer-assisted surgical systems.

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy. However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP) risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving 100\% verification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and intelligent security systems.

Abstract: Digitization projects in humanities often generate vast quantities of page images from historical documents, presenting significant challenges for manual sorting and analysis. These archives contain diverse content, including various text types (handwritten, typed, printed), graphical elements (drawings, maps, photos), and layouts (plain text, tables, forms). Efficiently processing this heterogeneous data requires automated methods to categorize pages based on their content, enabling tailored downstream analysis pipelines. This project addresses this need by developing and evaluating an image classification system specifically designed for historical document pages, leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The set of categories was chosen to facilitate content-specific processing workflows, separating pages requiring different analysis techniques (e.g., OCR for text, image analysis for graphics)

Abstract: The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has revolutionized computer vision, yet their effectiveness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN and ViT architectures across three critical medical imaging tasks: chest X-ray pneumonia detection, brain tumor classification, and skin cancer melanoma detection. We evaluated four state-of-the-art models - ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, and DeiT-Small - across datasets totaling 8,469 medical images. Our results demonstrate task-specific model advantages: ResNet-50 achieved 98.37% accuracy on chest X-ray classification, DeiT-Small excelled at brain tumor detection with 92.16% accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 led skin cancer classification at 81.84% accuracy. These findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting architectures for medical AI applications, highlighting the importance of task-specific architecture selection in clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security, misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However, comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward robust trustworthy systems.

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled samples.

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden.

<title>PRISM: Programmatic Reasoning with Image Sequence Manipulation for LVLM Jailbreaking</title>

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the entire reasoning process.

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks. The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at https://github.com/ENJOY-Yin-jiong/PHP.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

<title>MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE</title>

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%. Codes and models are available at $\href{https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/MixGRPO}{MixGRPO}$.

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned 1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our code is publicly available under https://github.com/JuliaWolleb/VidFuncta_public.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data, leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and 738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models (AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain. However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex, descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142 non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists. Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal. The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding, while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXGroundingCT.

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.

<title>Image Captioning via Compact Bidirectional Architecture</title>

Abstract: Most current image captioning models typically generate captions from left-to-right. This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context but not future context. Though refinement-based models can exploit both past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner in the first stage and a captioner in the second stage), which can only be executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly. Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a regularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally allowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that the compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new state-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining models. Finally, we verify the generality of this compact bidirectional architecture by extending it to LSTM backbone. Source code is available at https://github.com/YuanEZhou/cbtic.

Abstract: Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to segment scanning electron microscope images, enabling a quantitative analysis of carbide precipitates in lower bainite and tempered martensite steels with comparable strength. Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.

Abstract: Detecting anomaly patterns from images is a crucial artificial intelligence technique in industrial applications. Recent research in this domain has emphasized the necessity of a large volume of training data, overlooking the practical scenario where, post-deployment of the model, unlabeled data containing both normal and abnormal samples can be utilized to enhance the model's performance. Consequently, this paper focuses on addressing the challenging yet practical few-shot online anomaly detection and segmentation (FOADS) task. Under the FOADS framework, models are trained on a few-shot normal dataset, followed by inspection and improvement of their capabilities by leveraging unlabeled streaming data containing both normal and abnormal samples simultaneously.
  To tackle this issue, we propose modeling the feature distribution of normal images using a Neural Gas network, which offers the flexibility to adapt the topology structure to identify outliers in the data flow. In order to achieve improved performance with limited training samples, we employ multi-scale feature embedding extracted from a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet to obtain a robust representation. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm that can incrementally update parameters without the need to store previous samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve substantial performance under the FOADS setting, while ensuring that the time complexity remains within an acceptable range on MVTec AD and BTAD datasets.

Abstract: In modern computer vision, the optimal representation of 3D shape continues to be task-dependent. One fundamental operation applied to such representations is differentiable rendering, as it enables inverse graphics approaches in learning frameworks. Standard explicit shape representations (voxels, point clouds, or meshes) are often easily rendered, but can suffer from limited geometric fidelity, among other issues. On the other hand, implicit representations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater fidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting scalability. In this work, we devise Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), a novel neural shape representation that builds upon classical distance fields. The fundamental operation in a DDF maps an oriented point (position and direction) to surface visibility and depth. This enables efficient differentiable rendering, obtaining depth with a single forward pass per pixel, as well as differential geometric quantity extraction (e.g., surface normals), with only additional backward passes. Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities in the underlying field. We then apply DDFs to several applications, including single-shape fitting, generative modelling, and single-image 3D reconstruction, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural components via the versatility of our representation. Finally, since the dimensionality of DDFs permits view-dependent geometric artifacts, we conduct a theoretical investigation of the constraints necessary for view consistency. We find a small set of field properties that are sufficient to guarantee a DDF is consistent, without knowing, for instance, which shape the field is expressing.

Abstract: Sequential DeepFake detection is an emerging task that predicts the manipulation sequence in order. Existing methods typically formulate it as an image-to-sequence problem, employing conventional Transformer architectures. However, these methods lack dedicated design and consequently result in limited performance. As such, this paper describes a new Transformer design, called {TSOM}, by exploring three perspectives: Texture, Shape, and Order of Manipulations. Our method features four major improvements: \ding{182} we describe a new texture-aware branch that effectively captures subtle manipulation traces with a Diversiform Pixel Difference Attention module. \ding{183} Then we introduce a Multi-source Cross-attention module to seek deep correlations among spatial and sequential features, enabling effective modeling of complex manipulation traces. \ding{184} To further enhance the cross-attention, we describe a Shape-guided Gaussian mapping strategy, providing initial priors of the manipulation shape. \ding{185} Finally, observing that the subsequent manipulation in a sequence may influence traces left in the preceding one, we intriguingly invert the prediction order from forward to backward, leading to notable gains as expected. Building upon TSOM, we introduce an extended method, {TSOM++}, which additionally explores Relation of manipulations: \ding{186} we propose a new sequential contrastive learning scheme to capture relationships between various manipulation types in sequence, further enhancing the detection of manipulation traces. We conduct extensive experiments in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the superiority of our method. The code has been released at https://github.com/OUC-VAS/TSOM.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to revolutionize controllable 3D scene editing, particularly for object repositioning tasks, which traditionally requires intricate manual processes and specialized expertise. These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, Shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, Shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, Shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that Shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, Shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore Shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality.

Abstract: Most knowledge distillation (KD) methodologies predominantly focus on teacher-student pairs with similar architectures, such as both being convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the potential and flexibility of KD can be greatly improved by expanding it to novel Cross-Architecture KD (CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be transferred flexibly to a given student. The primary challenge in CAKD lies in the substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models, originating from the distinction of their inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this end, we introduce an assistant model as a bridge to facilitate smooth feature knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teachers and students. More importantly, within our proposed design principle, the assistant model combines the advantages of cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by merging convolution and attention modules derived from both student and teacher module functions. Furthermore, we observe that heterogeneous features exhibit diverse spatial distributions in CAKD, hindering the effectiveness of conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. Therefore, we leverage a spatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss to align features after spatial smoothing, thereby improving the feature alignments in CAKD. Our proposed method is evaluated across some homogeneous model pairs and arbitrary heterogeneous combinations of CNNs, ViTs, and MLPs, achieving state-of-the-art performance for distilled models with a maximum gain of 11.47% on CIFAR-100 and 3.67% on ImageNet-1K. Our code and models will be released.

<title>SAM2Long: Enhancing SAM 2 for Long Video Segmentation with a Training-Free Memory Tree</title>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&amp;F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS. The code is released at https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient structural health monitoring of infrastructure objects such as bridges is a vital task, as many existing constructions have already reached or are approaching their planned service life. In this contribution, we address the question of the suitability of UAV-based monitoring for SHM, in particular focusing on the geometric deformation under load. Such an advanced technology is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to decrease the cost and risk of tedious traditional inspection methods. To this end, we performed extensive tests employing a research reinforced concrete bridge that can be exposed to a predefined load via ground anchors. Very high-resolution image blocks have been captured before, during, and after the application of controlled loads. From those images, the motion of distinct points on the bridge has been monitored, and in addition, dense image point clouds were computed to evaluate the performance of surface-based data acquisition. Moreover, a geodetic control network in stable regions is used as control information for bundle adjustment. We applied different sensing technologies in order to be able to judge the image-based deformation results: displacement transducers, tachymetry, and laser profiling. As a platform for the photogrammetric measurements, a multi-rotor UAV DJI Matrice 600 Pro was employed, equipped with two RTK-GNSS receivers. The mounted camera was a PhaseOne iXM-100 (100MP) with an 80 mm lens. With a flying height of 30 m above the terrain, this resulted in a GSD of 1.3 mm while a forward and sideward overlap of 80% was maintained. The comparison with reference data (displacement transducers) reveals a difference of less than 1 mm. We show that by employing the introduced UAV-based monitoring approach, a full area-wide quantification of deformation is possible in contrast to classical point or profile measurements.

Abstract: We introduce LOcc, an effective and generalizable framework for open-vocabulary occupancy (OVO) prediction. Previous approaches typically supervise the networks through coarse voxel-to-text correspondences via image features as intermediates or noisy and sparse correspondences from voxel-based model-view projections. To alleviate the inaccurate supervision, we propose a semantic transitive labeling pipeline to generate dense and fine-grained 3D language occupancy ground truth. Our pipeline presents a feasible way to dig into the valuable semantic information of images, transferring text labels from images to LiDAR point clouds and ultimately to voxels, to establish precise voxel-to-text correspondences. By replacing the original prediction head of supervised occupancy models with a geometry head for binary occupancy states and a language head for language features, LOcc effectively uses the generated language ground truth to guide the learning of 3D language volume. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our transitive semantic labeling pipeline can produce more accurate pseudo-labeled ground truth, diminishing labor-intensive human annotations. Additionally, we validate LOcc across various architectures, where all models consistently outperform state-of-the-art zero-shot occupancy prediction approaches on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset.

<title>Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</title>

Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Sign language is a visual language that encompasses all linguistic features of natural languages and serves as the primary communication method for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Although many studies have successfully adapted pretrained language models (LMs) for sign language translation (sign-to-text), the reverse task-sign language generation (text-to-sign)-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts. To further ease the generation process, we propose a retrieval-enhanced SLG approach, which incorporates external sign dictionaries to provide accurate word-level signs as auxiliary conditions, significantly improving the precision of generated signs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SOKE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.

Abstract: Building on the success of diffusion models in image generation and editing, video editing has recently gained substantial attention. However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPaint, a unified generative space-time video inpainting framework that enables spatial-temporal inpainting and interpolation. Different from existing methods that treat video inpainting and video interpolation as two distinct tasks, we leverage a unified inpainting framework to tackle them and observe that these two tasks can mutually enhance synthesis performance. Specifically, we first introduce a plug-and-play space-time video inpainting adapter, which can be employed in various personalized models. The key insight is to propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) attention to cover various tasks. Then, we design a spatial-temporal masking strategy during the training stage to mutually enhance each other and improve performance. UniPaint produces high-quality and aesthetically pleasing results, achieving the best quantitative results across various tasks and scale setups. The code and checkpoints are available at $\href{https://github.com/mmmmm-w/UniPaint}{this \ repository}$.

Abstract: State-of-the-art supervised stereo matching methods have achieved remarkable performance on various benchmarks. However, their generalization to real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume comparable to Scene Flow.

Abstract: Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a \emph{sequence-invariant} self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. The result is a single 3D encoder that excels across tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3\% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). It also generalises to unseen sites, supporting scalable clinical use. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/contrast-squared

Abstract: Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.

Abstract: Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.

<title>Category-level Meta-learned NeRF Priors for Efficient Object Mapping</title>

Abstract: In 3D object mapping, category-level priors enable efficient object reconstruction and canonical pose estimation, requiring only a single prior per semantic category (e.g., chair, book, laptop, etc.). DeepSDF has been used predominantly as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct sharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency and enable canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know objects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction tasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category variations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF architecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training time. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling toward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving reconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results highlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with prior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21\% lower Chamfer distance. Furthermore, evaluations against other approaches using shape priors on a noisy real-world dataset indicate a 13\% improvement averaged across all reconstruction metrics, and comparable pose and size estimation accuracy, while being trained for 5$\times$ less time.

Abstract: In visual place recognition (VPR), filtering and sequence-based matching approaches can improve performance by integrating temporal information across image sequences, especially in challenging conditions. While these methods are commonly applied, their effects on system behavior can be unpredictable and can actually make performance worse in certain situations. In this work, we present a new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame sequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to selectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique and effectively predicts SMR, and hence significantly improves VPR performance across a large range of state-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR datasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain). We also provide insights into a complementary approach that uses the predictor to replace discarded matches, and present ablation studies including an analysis of the interactions between our SMR predictor and the selected sequence length.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a powerful non-intrusive technology for recognizing human activities, monitoring vital signs, and enabling context-aware applications using commercial wireless devices. However, the performance of Wi-Fi sensing often degrades when applied to new users, devices, or environments due to significant domain shifts. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed a wide range of generalization techniques aimed at enhancing the robustness and adaptability of Wi-Fi sensing systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of over 200 papers published since 2015, categorizing them according to the Wi-Fi sensing pipeline: experimental setup, signal preprocessing, feature learning, and model deployment. We analyze key techniques, including signal preprocessing, domain adaptation, meta-learning, metric learning, data augmentation, cross-modal alignment, federated learning, and continual learning. Furthermore, we summarize publicly available datasets across various tasks,such as activity recognition, user identification, indoor localization, and pose estimation, and provide insights into their domain diversity. We also discuss emerging trends and future directions, including large-scale pretraining, integration with multimodal foundation models, and continual deployment. To foster community collaboration, we introduce the Sensing Dataset Platform (SDP) for sharing datasets and models. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference and practical guide for researchers and practitioners dedicated to improving the generalizability of Wi-Fi sensing systems.

Abstract: Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.

Abstract: Humans perceive and comprehend their surroundings through information spanning multiple frequencies. In immersive scenes, people naturally scan their environment to grasp its overall structure while examining fine details of objects that capture their attention. However, current NeRF frameworks primarily focus on modeling either high-frequency local views or the broad structure of scenes with low-frequency information, which is limited to balancing both. We introduce FA-NeRF, a novel frequency-aware framework for view synthesis that simultaneously captures the overall scene structure and high-definition details within a single NeRF model. To achieve this, we propose a 3D frequency quantification method that analyzes the scene's frequency distribution, enabling frequency-aware rendering. Our framework incorporates a frequency grid for fast convergence and querying, a frequency-aware feature re-weighting strategy to balance features across different frequency contents. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in modeling entire scenes while preserving fine details. Project page: https://coscatter.github.io/LookCloser/

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which uses RGB images as guidance to convert raw signals from dToF into high-precision, dense depth maps, is a critical task in computer vision. Although existing super-resolution-based methods show promising results on public datasets, they often rely on idealized assumptions like accurate region correspondences and reliable dToF inputs, overlooking calibration errors that cause misalignment and anomaly signals inherent to dToF imaging, limiting real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel completion-based method, named DEPTHOR, featuring advances in both the training strategy and model architecture. First, we propose a method to simulate real-world dToF data from the accurate ground truth in synthetic datasets to enable noise-robust training. Second, we design a novel network that incorporates monocular depth estimation (MDE), leveraging global depth relationships and contextual information to improve prediction in challenging regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset, our training strategy significantly enhances depth completion models, achieving results comparable to depth super-resolution methods, while our model achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Rel and RMSE by 27% and 18%, respectively. On a more challenging set of dToF samples we collected, our method outperforms SOTA methods on preliminary stereo-based GT, improving Rel and RMSE by 23% and 22%, respectively.

Abstract: Methods for navigation based on large-scale learning typically treat each episode as a new problem, where the agent is spawned with a clean memory in an unknown environment. While these generalization capabilities to an unknown environment are extremely important, we claim that, in a realistic setting, an agent should have the capacity of exploiting information collected during earlier robot operations. We address this by introducing a new retrieval-augmented agent, trained with RL, capable of querying a database collected from previous episodes in the same environment and learning how to integrate this additional context information. We introduce a unique agent architecture for the general navigation task, evaluated on ImageNav, Instance-ImageNav and ObjectNav. Our retrieval and context encoding methods are data-driven and employ vision foundation models (FM) for both semantic and geometric understanding. We propose new benchmarks for these settings and we show that retrieval allows zero-shot transfer across tasks and environments while significantly improving performance.

Abstract: We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras, shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays, which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

Abstract: Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision on the validation set. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78\% to 93\% when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.

Abstract: The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Abstract: Existing optical flow datasets focus primarily on real-world simulation or synthetic human motion, but few are tailored to Celluloid(cel) anime character motion: a domain with unique visual and motion characteristics. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We present FlagEvalMM, an open-source evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess multimodal models across a diverse range of vision-language understanding and generation tasks, such as visual question answering, text-to-image/video generation, and image-text retrieval. We decouple model inference from evaluation through an independent evaluation service, thus enabling flexible resource allocation and seamless integration of new tasks and models. Moreover, FlagEvalMM utilizes advanced inference acceleration tools (e.g., vLLM, SGLang) and asynchronous data loading to significantly enhance evaluation efficiency.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have advanced capabilities in visual question answering (VQA). However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that jointly attributes LVLM outputs to the most relevant visual evidence and textual signals that support open-ended generation. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior methods in faithfulness and pushing the state-of-the-art in human-attention alignment. We demonstrate an analytic approach to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning dynamics, analyze systematic misalignment, diagnose hallucination and bias, and ensure transparency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, their application to long video understanding remains hindered by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{PEVLM}, a fine-tuning-free parallel encoding method designed to enhance the prefilling efficiency of VLMs in long video scenarios. PEVLM partitions the input video into context blocks with a shared sink block, while preserving sequential position embeddings to align the attention weight distribution with that of Full-Attention. This design reduces attention complexity from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ where $T$ is the number of frames and $N$ the number of tokens per frame, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art models and benchmarks demonstrate that PEVLM consistently outperforms existing parallel encoding approaches, achieving up to \textbf{7.47x} speedup in attention computation and reducing end-to-end latency by \textbf{40\%}. Remarkably, PEVLM not only maintains high accuracy, but in some settings even surpasses Full-Attention performance. Under strict latency constraints, it achieves substantial gains, improving accuracy from \textbf{23.26\%} to \textbf{61.03\%}. These results underscore the effectiveness of PEVLM for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However, most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset (PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes. Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs ($>77$ tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP, which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images, respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains. Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over 80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior analysis across various fields.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$ ($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary $\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuangShiqi128/SCORE.

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at https://jahnsonblack.github.io/DreamScene-Full/.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations. Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding, bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are portrayed as a remedy for debugging and trusting statistical and deep learning models, as well as interpreting their predictions. However, recent advances in adversarial machine learning (AdvML) highlight the limitations and vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art explanation methods, putting their security and trustworthiness into question. The possibility of manipulating, fooling or fairwashing evidence of the model's reasoning has detrimental consequences when applied in high-stakes decision-making and knowledge discovery. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of research concerning adversarial attacks on explanations of machine learning models, as well as fairness metrics. We introduce a unified notation and taxonomy of methods facilitating a common ground for researchers and practitioners from the intersecting research fields of AdvML and XAI. We discuss how to defend against attacks and design robust interpretation methods. We contribute a list of existing insecurities in XAI and outline the emerging research directions in adversarial XAI (AdvXAI). Future work should address improving explanation methods and evaluation protocols to take into account the reported safety issues.

Abstract: World models allow autonomous agents to plan and explore by predicting the visual outcomes of different actions. However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.

Abstract: In response to the growing challenges of manual labor and efficiency in warehouse operations, Amazon has embarked on a significant transformation by incorporating robotics to assist with various tasks. While a substantial number of robots have been successfully deployed for tasks such as item transportation within warehouses, the complex process of object picking from shelves remains a significant challenge. This project addresses the issue by developing an innovative robotic system capable of autonomously fulfilling a simulated order by efficiently selecting specific items from shelves. A distinguishing feature of the proposed robotic system is its capacity to navigate the challenge of uncertain object positions within each bin of the shelf. The system is engineered to autonomously adapt its approach, employing strategies that enable it to efficiently locate and retrieve the desired items, even in the absence of pre-established knowledge about their placements.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly employed in high-stakes medical applications, despite their tendency for shortcut learning in the presence of spurious correlations, which can have potentially fatal consequences in practice. Whereas a multitude of works address either the detection or mitigation of such shortcut behavior in isolation, the Reveal2Revise approach provides a comprehensive bias mitigation framework combining these steps. However, effectively addressing these biases often requires substantial labeling efforts from domain experts. In this work, we review the steps of the Reveal2Revise framework and enhance it with semi-automated interpretability-based bias annotation capabilities. This includes methods for the sample- and feature-level bias annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of the framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.

<title>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.

Abstract: Digital twins are fundamental to the development of autonomous driving and embodied artificial intelligence. However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field. This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality across diverse trajectories. To benefit the community, the codes are released at https://github.com/hku-mars/GS-SDF.

Abstract: Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Summary:
RAda introduces a novel fine-tuning technique for pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), focusing on the fused representation for decision-making. By utilizing a learned mask from an added attention layer, RAda dynamically calibrates the contributions of elements in the rational matrix without modifying intermediate features. This approach allows for targeted adjustments to final cross-modal interactions, enhancing performance without extensive code changes. Experimental results demonstrate RAda's versatility in various settings, including updating or freezing pretrained encoders during adaptation, and test-time training scenarios with access to unlabeled test data. The proposed method improves upon baseline performance with minimal implementation effort and competes favorably against current state-of-the-art techniques. The code for RAda is available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features. Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably against current arts in most settings.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios.

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant.

We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69% test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

<div> affinity matrix, self-attention, deep learning, transformers, pairwise relationships
Summary:<br /><br />The paper explores the concept of self-attention as a specific case of Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS), which relies on pairwise affinity matrices to control information flow in models. It traces the origins of self-attention in domains like computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning, highlighting the common reliance on the affinity matrix A. While self-attention in Transformers uses a fixed dot-product structure, Inf-FS allows for dynamic definition and computation of the affinity matrix, computing feature relevance through multi-hop propagation. The underlying principle of reasoning over pairwise relationships is shared between self-attention and Inf-FS, with differences in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By framing self-attention within the broader context of affinity-based computation, the paper unifies various machine learning techniques and tasks under a common mathematical foundation. <div>
arXiv:2507.14560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces GUI-Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G²), a novel reward framework for graphical user interface (GUI) interaction tasks. Unlike existing binary reward systems, GUI-G² models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions, capturing the continuous nature of spatial interactions. This framework incorporates Gaussian point rewards for precise localization and coverage rewards to assess spatial alignment. An adaptive variance mechanism handles diverse element scales, facilitating dense continuous optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-G² outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Continuous modeling enhances robustness to interface variations and generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.

Summary:<br />
Enhancing images in low-light conditions is crucial in computer vision. The TAGC model addresses this challenge by automatically calculating an adaptive gamma coefficient based on color luminance analysis to improve image quality. The model effectively enhances low-light images by maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color distribution without manual adjustment. This approach provides a more efficient solution for various applications such as night surveillance, medical image enhancement, and photography in low-light environments. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that the TAGC model significantly improves the visual quality of low-light images, making it a valuable tool in image processing. <div>

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical images, and photography in low-light environments.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Data scarcity is a significant challenge in medical imaging, especially for deep learning models. While data pooling and data addition have shown to improve model performance, they can lead to distributional shifts, causing the Data Addition Dilemma. In multi-source contexts, assuming exchangeability across datasets can help address this issue. This study focuses on medical image segmentation, using causal frameworks to control foreground-background feature discrepancies in deep networks. Their method enhances feature representations, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images from five datasets, including a newly curated ultrasound dataset. Qualitative results show more precise segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across various model architectures. The code will be available on Github. <div>

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources) and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically, increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model architectures. The code will be available on Github.

 <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However, automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges, we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction. Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb, with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively. Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

<div> Keywords: surgical instrument segmentation, part-aware instance segmentation, transformer-based mask classification, weakly-supervised learning, student-teacher approach

Summary: SurgPIS is introduced as a part-aware instance segmentation model for surgical instruments, combining instrument-level instance segmentation and part-level semantic segmentation. It utilizes a transformer-based mask classification approach with part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object queries. To overcome limited datasets, a weakly-supervised learning strategy is proposed, using disjoint datasets with either instance- or part-level labels. During training, predictions are aggregated into instance or part masks to compute loss against partially labeled datasets. A student-teacher approach maintains prediction consistency for missing part-aware instance segmentation information in the data. SurgPIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-aware instance segmentation, instrument-level instance segmentation, part-level semantic segmentation, and surgical tool segmentation. <div>
arXiv:2507.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS) separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

In this paper, a new Video Large Language Model (VideoLLM) is introduced to address limitations in existing models by allowing users to interact with videos using textual and visual prompts. The Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module (STOM) is proposed to propagate visual prompts within videos, enabling object-centric, multiround interactions. The VideoInfer dataset is presented, containing object-centric video instructions for question-answering tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms baselines across video question answering and segmentation tasks on various benchmarks.

arXiv:2507.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

Summary:
Exemplar Med-DETR introduces a multi-modal contrastive detector for detecting abnormalities in medical images, particularly in mammography. By utilizing cross-attention with class-specific exemplar features, the detector improves mass and calcifications detection performance on dense breast mammograms, achieving state-of-the-art results. The iterative training strategy enhances feature learning, enabling better lesion detection across different imaging modalities. Radiologist-supported evaluation on an out-of-distribution dataset shows a twofold increase in lesion detection performance. The system also improves mass and stenosis detection on chest X-rays and angiography, demonstrating its potential to enhance robust and generalizable detection systems for medical imaging.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets. On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16 percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100 mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre- and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024 BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms, including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies, enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate, such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge. Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments. Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355 neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young: 20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0% improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection, while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

 Using label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning strategies, this paper addresses the scale challenges faced in supervised fine-tuning of compact Vision Language Models for image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce. By leveraging unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead.

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets. Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Summary: 
The study addresses the potential bias in synthetic face detection models, highlighting the overlooked issue that biased models can lead to failures in detecting synthetic content for certain demographic groups. An evaluation framework is introduced to analyze bias in synthetic face detectors, using evenly distributed attribute labels in synthetic data generation to mitigate skew in the data. The study conducts a case study on five top detectors, revealing biases towards specific facial attributes. The analysis explores correlations with attribute balancing in training sets and examines detectors' activation maps with controlled attribute modifications to understand the origins of bias. Overall, the results confirm the bias in synthetic face detectors and emphasize the importance of addressing bias in these models to avoid social, legal, and ethical implications. <div>

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content, one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

<div> Quaternion-based RPCA, moving target detection, color video processing, background recovery, deep models <br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel framework called universal QRPCA (uQRPCA) for moving target detection in color videos captured by static cameras. By utilizing a quaternion Riemannian manifold, the computational complexity of Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) is reduced to o(1). The uQRPCA framework achieves both segmentation of targets and recovery of backgrounds in color videos, addressing the limitations of existing methods. Additionally, the uQRPCA+ framework, which incorporates the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method, further refines the background recovery process across color channels. Experimental results show that uQRPCA+ outperforms existing open-source methods in terms of moving target detection and background recovery tasks, demonstrating State Of The Art (SOTA) performance. The implementation of the proposed frameworks is publicly available on GitHub for research and development purposes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1 quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA) framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Ruchtech/uQRPCA

<div> LiDAR guidance, RAFT-Stereo, stereo matching accuracy, sparse LiDAR conditions, Guided RAFT-Stereo <br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the use of LiDAR guidance in the RAFT-Stereo framework to enhance stereo matching accuracy by incorporating precise LiDAR depth information. It identifies a significant decrease in the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance when the number of LiDAR points is sparse, proposing a novel explanation grounded in signal processing theory. A simple yet effective solution is introduced, involving pre-filling the initial sparse disparity map with interpolation, which enables LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to perform optimally. Additionally, the study demonstrates the efficacy of pre-filling in injecting LiDAR depth into image features through early fusion, necessitating a unique pre-filling approach. The resulting Guided RAFT-Stereo (GRAFT-Stereo) method surpasses existing LiDAR-guided approaches in sparse LiDAR scenarios across diverse datasets, indicating potential for enhanced LiDAR-guided stereo methods in the future. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo (GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory (LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting a new benchmark in VIS.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel computer vision task called Face Retouching Restoration (FRR) to address concerns about the authenticity of retouched face images on social media platforms. Unlike traditional image restoration tasks, FRR focuses on accurately recovering original faces from retouched ones, tackling various types and degrees of complex retouching operations. The proposed MoFRR method leverages a Mixture of Diffusion Models with specialized experts for different retouching types and a shared expert for universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert includes a dual-branch structure for low-frequency information restoration and high-frequency detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset validate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR tasks. <div>

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for self-supervised representation learning in computer vision tasks. Through in-depth analysis, it is revealed that MAE learns pattern-based patch-level clustering early on during pretraining. Building upon this insight, a new approach called self-guided masked autoencoder is proposed. This method internally generates informed masks based on the progress in patch clustering, enhancing the learning process compared to the traditional MAE with random masking. The self-guided approach boosts learning without external models or additional information, maintaining the self-supervised nature of MAE. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in improving representation learning and performance in computer vision applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

arXiv:2507.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud. Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at https://github.com/Point-Cloud-Learning/HydraMamba.

Summary:
JDATT is a new framework that addresses the challenges of atmospheric turbulence mitigation and target detection by integrating state-of-the-art modules and introducing a unified knowledge distillation strategy. The framework employs feature-level distillation through Channel-Wise Distillation and Masked Generative Distillation, as well as output-level distillation using Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world turbulence datasets show that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time.

arXiv:2507.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling, blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme: feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time, making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Summary: TransFlow addresses the challenge of training video salient object detection models due to limited video datasets by transferring motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models. It generates realistic training data for video SOD by leveraging semantic motion priors learned by video diffusion models from large-scale video data. TransFlow produces semantically-aware optical flows from static images that exhibit natural motion patterns while maintaining spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. This approach leads to improved performance on multiple benchmarks, showcasing effective motion knowledge transfer for video salient object detection tasks. <div>

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Summary: 
DepthFlow proposes a novel approach to unsupervised video object segmentation by synthesizing optical flow from single images. By leveraging depth maps and their correlation with structural information, DepthFlow generates synthetic flow fields that capture essential structural cues. This process expands the available training data for VOS models, improving performance on public benchmarks. The method involves estimating depth maps from source images and converting them into synthetic flow fields, enabling the transformation of image-mask pairs to image-flow-mask training pairs. Training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with the synthesized data leads to new state-of-the-art results on VOS benchmarks. DepthFlow demonstrates a scalable and effective solution to the data scarcity issue in VOS tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data scarcity problem.

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands. We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide essential geometric references and layout information for document image correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet) to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and table borders.

Summary: Popular transformer detectors have shown strong performance in object detection tasks using attention mechanisms. However, the effectiveness of existing decoder query types and their fixed nature have limited flexibility and efficiency. This study introduces DS-Det, a more efficient detector that allows for a flexible number of object detections in images. By reformulating the decoder modeling and employing attention disentangled learning, DS-Det addresses issues such as Recurrent Opposing inTeractions and query ambiguity. The unified Single-Query paradigm and simplified decoder framework improve decoder efficiency by focusing on one-to-many processes for locating boxes and one-to-one processes for deduplicating predictions. Additionally, the unified PoCoo loss prioritizes learning on hard samples like small objects. Extensive experiments on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets across different backbone models demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DS-Det in object detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number (fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention (query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det, a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible. Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process), addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects. Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of DS-Det.

<div> Keywords: semantic segmentation, text-to-image generative models, attention mechanisms, seeded segmentation, self-attention

Summary: 
SeeDiff is a novel method for pixel-level object classification that leverages text-to-image generative models, specifically Stable Diffusion, to generate annotation masks without requiring pre-training or additional tuning. By analyzing the attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, the method utilizes cross-attention for initial object localization and self-attention for semantic correspondence modeling to iteratively spread attention across the entire object class. Additionally, the method refines masks by incorporating background information to improve accuracy. SeeDiff's approach is effective for generating high-quality masks without the need for a pre-trained segmentation network or complex training procedures. The method demonstrates the ability to generate accurate masks for complex objects by leveraging the structured background in synthetic images. SeeDiff offers a promising solution for efficient pixel-level object classification without relying on extensive manual annotation efforts or complicated training processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

<div> Keywords: Urban flooding, arid regions, flood mapping, PlanetScope imagery, hierarchical framework

Summary:
Urban flooding in arid regions presents significant challenges due to limited spectral contrast, rapid hydrological dynamics, and heterogeneous land covers. Traditional flood-mapping approaches struggle in such environments, highlighting the need for advanced techniques. The FM-LC framework, introduced in this study, utilizes high-resolution PlanetScope imagery for accurate flood mapping by identifying land cover types. The framework consists of a multi-class U-Net segmentation, a binary expert model for misclassified classes, and Bayesian smoothing for boundary refinement. Applied to the April 2024 Dubai storm event, the framework significantly improves F1-scores and provides sharper flood delineations compared to traditional methods. This approach showcases the effectiveness of utilizing hierarchical frameworks and high-resolution imagery for mapping urban floods in arid regions.

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information. We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional single-stage U-Net baselines.

Summary:
The article introduces a new system called Lava designed for efficient querying of massive amounts of video data in urban environments. Lava allows users to input natural language queries, enabling flexible and detailed searches for traffic targets in videos. The system includes components for video segment-level localization, object-level detection, and long-term object trajectory extraction. An evaluation benchmark with diverse natural language predicates and annotations was developed to test Lava's performance. Results showed that Lava significantly improved F1 scores for selection queries, reduced errors in aggregation queries, and achieved high precision for top-k queries. Additionally, Lava processed videos almost 10 times faster than the most accurate baseline, demonstrating its efficiency in handling large-scale video databases.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

<div> Autosign, continuous sign language recognition, autoregressive decoder-only transformer, pose sequences, natural language text <br />
Summary: <br />
Autosign is introduced as a novel approach for continuous sign language recognition, aiming to bridge the communication gap between hearing and hearing-impaired communities. By leveraging an autoregressive decoder-only transformer, Autosign directly translates pose sequences to natural language text without traditional alignment mechanisms. This eliminates error propagation, overfitting, and scalability issues seen in existing methods, achieving up to a 6.1% improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) on the Isharah-1000 dataset. Through temporal compression with 1D CNNs and leveraging AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, Autosign effectively processes sign gestures and generates accurate glosses. The model demonstrates the importance of hand and body gestures in signer-independent CSLR, showcasing the potential for improved accessibility and inclusivity in communication technology. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text, bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences, followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR. By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to 6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

<div> Keywords: Out-of-distribution detection, Negative Feature Tuning, Knowledge Regularization, Vision-language models, Generalization performance<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT) for improved out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in vision-language models. Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) is implemented to enhance the separation of in-distribution (ID) and OOD images by transforming pre-trained text features. A meta-network is employed for dynamic adaptation to individual images, reducing sensitivity to class and style shifts. The Knowledge Regularization (KR) optimization strategy is designed to enhance discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating pre-trained knowledge forgetting. Compared to traditional methods, KR-NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability. When trained with few-shot samples from the ImageNet dataset, KR-NFT improves ID classification accuracy, OOD detection performance, and reduces the False Positive Rate (FPR95) by 5.44% under an unexplored generalization setting with unseen ID categories. <div>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability. To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset, KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization setting with unseen ID categories.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets - short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task, especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal dimensions via text.

<div> Keywords: pose-lifting, joint dependencies, structure-aware, motion-adaptive, computational efficiency

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework called SAMA for the pose-lifting task, which aims to capture spatial joint topology and diverse motion dynamics independently. SAMA consists of two key modules: the Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and the Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). SSI leverages dynamic joint relationships to fuse information based on pose topology, while MSM recognizes joint-specific motion characteristics and makes tailored adjustments. By incorporating these modules, SAMA enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that SAMA outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy while requiring less computational costs. The framework addresses the challenges of intricate joint connections and varying motion characteristics, providing a more effective and efficient solution for the pose-lifting task. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically, SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs.

The framework includes FLI for initializing 3D Gaussians, IMA for fusing semantics and geometry, and MGF for rendering BEV features.

arXiv:2507.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

arXiv:2507.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting," and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.

arXiv:2507.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ) medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts. However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks, DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Summary: 
ATCTrack is a novel tracker designed to improve vision-language tracking by effectively modeling target-context features and utilizing multimodal cues aligned with dynamic target states. The tracker employs a temporal visual target-context modeling approach to provide timely visual cues and a precise target words identification method for textual cues. Additionally, an innovative context words calibration technique is used to adaptively incorporate context words. Through extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, ATCTrack has achieved state-of-the-art performance in vision-language tracking. The code and models for ATCTrack will be made available on GitHub for future research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT, it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers (VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking. Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words. (3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/XiaokunFeng/ATCTrack.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R, the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes, BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for autonomous driving under federated learning

It achieves this by modifying final-layer attention to focus on semantically relevant tokens. The evaluation on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection (OV-RefOD) using the FitAP metric shows that RCA improves performance in 11 out of 15 VLMs, with gains up to 26.6%. The effectiveness of RCA is influenced by attention sharpness and fusion timing, with late-fusion models consistently benefiting. Interestingly, even models with different architectures like DeepSeek-VL2 show improvement, indicating that capacity and disentanglement are crucial. Overall, RCA offers both interpretability and performance enhancements for multimodal transformers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection (OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like $\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for multimodal transformers.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces TrackAny3D, a novel framework for 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking that aims to overcome challenges such as sparse and irregular point clouds. This framework utilizes pretrained models for category-agnostic tracking, integrating adapters to maintain geometric priors and introducing a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture to adapt to different geometric characteristics. A temporal context optimization strategy is also implemented to improve tracking accuracy and mitigate temporal drift.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics. Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of large-scale pretrained models in this field.

This paper introduces a mini-batch training strategy for deep subspace clustering (DSC) by incorporating a memory bank to store global feature representations, addressing the limitations of full-batch processing. The proposed approach enables efficient training of deep architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images.

arXiv:2507.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures. However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by fine-tuning deep networks.

Summary:
HumanSAM is a new framework designed to classify human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of anomalies commonly seen in generated videos: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly. The framework aims to address the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types in binary forgery video detection. HumanSAM generates human forgery representations by fusing two branches of video understanding and spatial depth to capture geometry, semantics, and spatiotemporal consistency. It also incorporates a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during training to learn more robust representations. The HumanSAM framework is evaluated on the Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV) dataset, the first public benchmark of its kind. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HumanSAM in both binary and multi-class forgery classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class forgery classification.

Summary:
MambaVesselNet++ is a novel hybrid framework for medical image segmentation that combines the efficiency of convolution-based U-shape architectures with the global context capture of vision transformers and the low memory complexity of the selective state space model Mamba. The framework features a texture-aware layer for capturing low-level semantic features and utilizes Mamba to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The bifocal fusion decoder combines local and global information for accurate segmentation mask generation. Experimental results show that MambaVesselNet++ outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various medical segmentation tasks, including 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation. The code for MambaVesselNet++ is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation. Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

The paper introduces the LLM_Control framework for enhancing controllable text-to-image generation. By utilizing a multimodal LLM as a global controller, the framework improves grounding capabilities to accurately modulate pre-trained diffusion models. This allows for precise generation of images based on visual conditions and textual prompts.

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task. By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues, we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder, which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution (DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations. Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Summary: <br />
Visual anomaly detection is crucial for industrial inspection and medical diagnosis, but existing methods often require extensive training data. To address this limitation, the AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused CLIP) approach is proposed, which enhances visual representations to focus on detecting local defects. By introducing a lightweight adapter that emphasizes anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, AF-CLIP optimizes both class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for precise anomaly localization. Additionally, a multi-scale spatial aggregation mechanism is used to capture anomalies of different sizes and improve detection accuracy. Learnable textual prompts are also designed to characterize normal and abnormal states. Through optimization on auxiliary datasets and the use of memory banks in few-shot scenarios, AF-CLIP demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability across various industrial and medical datasets. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are validated through experimental results. <div>

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task, they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies, reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context. Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method.

Summary:
MedARC's team solution for the Algonauts 2025 challenge involved leveraging multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video, speech, text, vision-text, and vision-text-audio. The features extracted from these models were projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to fMRI time series, and mapped to cortical parcels using a lightweight encoder with shared and subject-specific components. Through training multiple model variants, validating on held-out movies, and creating ensembles tailored to each parcel and subject, the team achieved a Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split. Additionally, a last-minute optimization could have improved the team's ranking to second place. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining features from diverse modalities, employing a simple architecture, and conducting thorough model selection and ensembling to enhance the generalization of encoding models to new stimuli.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images, eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases that often demand urgent care.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding. Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges, including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue, we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing. Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Howardkhh/FROSS.

<title>VAMPIRE: Uncovering Vessel Directional and Morphological Information from OCTA Images for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Prediction</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models, the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement (VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones, OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/VAMPIRE.

<title>Region-based Cluster Discrimination for Visual Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data. Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

<title>TAPS : Frustratingly Simple Test Time Active Learning for VLMs</title>

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical diagnostics.

<title>FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation (2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM) restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

<title>The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

<title>Local Prompt Adaptation for Style-Consistent Multi-Object Generation in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper, we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics, offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based generation.

<title>Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference. Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST), based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1) introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is available at https://github.com/lhy-cn/HDST-HSIDenoise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players, involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Akahori000/Ultrasound-Medial-Epicondyle-Avulsion-Dataset.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM, a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain. Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation.

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications. However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge, especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation, abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion. Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries. This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training, surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve 54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However, most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc. Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label (Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

Abstract: We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that leverages a fine-tuned YOLO12l-seg model -- trained on over 500 annotated post-blast images -- to deliver real-time instance segmentation (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~ 15 FPS). High-fidelity masks are converted into normalized 3D coordinates, from which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy, robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated blast-effect assessment in field conditions.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs. However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network (WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection. Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.

arXiv:2507.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research, there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart, referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However, this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment. Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\ \textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model, training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely available at https://github.com/daulettoibazar/Compact_VLM_Filter.

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective. Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Zeyu1226-mt/LLM-IAVC.

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore, we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors, from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without deviating from its generalist architecture.

<title>LRR-Bench: Left, Right or Rotate? Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks</title>

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.

<title>Towards Universal Modal Tracking with Online Dense Temporal Token Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20177</link>

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically, our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker} achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack.

<title>MoCTEFuse: Illumination-Gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts for Multi-Level Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20180</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle, MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance. Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93% on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

<title>SAMwave: Wavelet-Driven Feature Enrichment for Effective Adaptation of Segment Anything Model</title>

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods. However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain. However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients, SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods. This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for adapting segment anything models.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context. This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention. Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset. We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8% mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

<title>When Tokens Talk Too Much: A Survey of Multimodal Long-Context Token Compression across Images, Videos, and Audios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.

<title>Dual-Stream Global-Local Feature Collaborative Representation Network for Scene Classification of Mining Area</title>

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1) Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2) Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets, ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models. Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions. Our code, pre-trained models, and videos are available at https://robinwitch.github.io/MECo-Page.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification (benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones - EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 - are each adapted with a custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference. Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically, MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source code will be available at https://github.com/ZiziAmy/MambaMap.

arXiv:2507.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality. However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space, promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks, such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968 species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AnimalCluePage/

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/staraink/MIRepNet}.

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer (L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2) Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4% overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and 23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50% spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

<title>Controllable Feature Whitening for Hyperparameter-Free Bias Mitigation</title>

arXiv:2507.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ, WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized, because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection. Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts these masked words by combining contextual information from different modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, especially for the detection of emergency news.

<title>Fine-structure Preserved Real-world Image Super-resolution via Transfer VAE Training</title>

arXiv:2507.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model. One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion; however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the 8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

<title>SWIFT: A General Sensitive Weight Identification Framework for Fast Sensor-Transfer Pansharpening</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20311</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to, full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

<title>From Gallery to Wrist: Realistic 3D Bracelet Insertion in Videos</title>

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing.

<title>PIVOTS: Aligning unseen Structures using Preoperative to Intraoperative Volume-To-Surface Registration for Liver Navigation</title>

arXiv:2507.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility. We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code and datasets are available here https://github.com/pengliu-nct/PIVOTS.

<title>Detecting Visual Information Manipulation Attacks in Augmented Reality: A Multimodal Semantic Reasoning Approach</title>

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<title>Generative Pre-training for Subjective Tasks: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Framework for Facial Beauty Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20363</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification (e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP, sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for subjective visual tasks.

<title>MagicAnime: A Hierarchically Annotated, Multimodal and Multitasking Dataset with Benchmarks for Cartoon Animation Generation</title>

arXiv:2507.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation, 12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation, validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and controllable generation.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer (CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings, segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at https://github.com/albrateanu/ModalFormer.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the process.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: This work summarises and reports the results of the second Presentation Attack Detection competition on ID cards. This new version includes new elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44% EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode" team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER, improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER, respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it is still a challenging problem related to the number of images, especially of bona fide images.

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf & mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf & hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset & demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology. The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area, thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to determining the alertness for work.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm, exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding. Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB, highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and autonomous navigation.

<title>An Improved YOLOv8 Approach for Small Target Detection of Rice Spikelet Flowering in Field Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20506</link>

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains challenging.
  To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
  Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%, representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively, over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set, meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2 offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances. The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning models in geospatial applications.

<title>Beyond Class Tokens: LLM-guided Dominant Property Mining for Few-shot Classification</title>

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method (BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image representations, including both global category representation and the patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

<title>GaRe: Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting for Outdoor Scenes from Unconstrained Photo Collections</title>

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight, sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections. Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

<title>T2VParser: Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for Partial Alignment in Text to Video Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20518</link>

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP, existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching. Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information. In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities. The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VParser.

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy, text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks. Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random. With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM development. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AgroBenchPage/ .

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

arXiv:2507.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of 59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for future enhancements.

<title>T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/T2I-Copilot.

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$ norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment (IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

arXiv:2507.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling. Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing, preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client. Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>MemoryTalker: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation via Audio-Guided Stylization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However, previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages: 1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and 2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e., Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Learning Phonetic Context-Dependent Viseme for Enhancing Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation</title>

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

arXiv:2507.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches, such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks, achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features. Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features, thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Yanyin-Guo/LSFDNet

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of 3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like" data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism, which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally, we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential (TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions, thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics, establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges: removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size. Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.

arXiv:2507.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications -- colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.

<title>A Multimodal Architecture for Endpoint Position Prediction in Team-based Multiplayer Games</title>

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics. However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder. The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs, numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently, the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in photovoltaic modules is essential for maintaining energy efficiency and system reliablility. This work presents a supervised deep learning framework for segmenting thermal infrared images of PV panels, using a dataset of 277 aerial thermographic images captured by zenmuse XT infrared camera mounted on a DJI Matrice 100 drone. The preprocessing pipeline includes image resizing, CLAHE based contrast enhancement, denoising, and normalisation. A lightweight semantic segmentation model based on SegFormer is developed, featuring a customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance, we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes per-class Dice score, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, mean IoU, and pixel accuracy. The SegFormer-based model outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency, particularly for segmenting small and irregular defects. Its lightweight design real-time deployment on edge devices and seamless integration with drone-based systems for automated inspection of large-scale solar farms.

<title>Automatic camera orientation estimation for a partially calibrated camera above a plane with a line at known planar distance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20689</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust, preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

<title>Style-Aware Blending and Prototype-Based Cross-Contrast Consistency for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20729</link>

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However, existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically, inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework. Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data incompleteness.

<title>Implicit Counterfactual Learning for Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20740</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches, especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT) involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance. Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples, thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations, promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Regularizing Subspace Redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation. Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy constraints to the feature distributions across different projections. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucenova/ReSoRA.

<title>Learning to See Inside Opaque Liquid Containers using Speckle Vibrometry</title>

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from various everyday containers.

<title>KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video</title>

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts. Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser (LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/jw0r1n/KASportsFormer

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction. However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

<title>Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical, SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing modalities.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen, using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic data.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently, data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as demonstrated in our results.

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages, and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms, such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels, strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and 75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/AiEson/SCANet

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding. Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy. Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

<title>$S^3$LAM: Surfel Splatting SLAM for Geometrically Accurate Tracking and Mapping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20854</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry, benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that $S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly available.

<title>Compositional Video Synthesis by Temporal Object-Centric Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20855</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion, deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

<title>Ensemble Foreground Management for Unsupervised Object Discovery</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1) determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/YFaris/UnionCut.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets, robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves $92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception, limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics. Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition (ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes, mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

<title>$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement</title>

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations. Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core components during inference.

<title>Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901</link>

arXiv:2507.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes, making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset, resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions, paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

<title>SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

<title>RIS-LAD: A Benchmark and Model for Referring Low-Altitude Drone Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored. Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small, cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at: https://github.com/AHideoKuzeA/RIS-LAD/.

<title>Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval</title>

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE, which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents. Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet. However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on H20 GPU.

<title>Mask-Free Audio-driven Talking Face Generation for Enhanced Visual Quality and Identity Preservation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces, significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently, we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various ablation studies to validate our contributions.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method.

<title>Adapting Vehicle Detectors for Aerial Imagery to Unseen Domains with Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application. However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle) leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments. Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than 50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages, existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation. Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive eval- uation frameworks that assess both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for region- specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1), comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities across 2 million video samples, and an evalua- tion protocol for assessing joint audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/deepreasonings/WholeBodyBenchmark.

<title>Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM</title>

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models (LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii) general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs, thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

<title>Improving Adversarial Robustness Through Adaptive Learning-Driven Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained, these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy, enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

<title>Learning Transferable Facial Emotion Representations from Large-Scale Semantically Rich Captions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21015</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values. This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability, as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible, expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and 2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module. This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich captions. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/sunlicai/EmoCapCLIP.

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation, enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks, consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity. These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in instruction-guided image editing.

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

Abstract: In the research and development (R&amp;D) and verification and validation (V&amp;V) phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11 plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV, DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B - 26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation: https://github.com/SD122025/ChartGen/

<title>Multipath Interference Suppression in Indirect Time-of-Flight Imaging via a Novel Compressed Sensing Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19546</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without requiring any additional hardware changes.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO, CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias (spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention, resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves, particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture and function.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities--speech, vision, and text--and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models. This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of 0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in real-world settings.

<title>A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Microphysical Properties of Ice Crystals from Cloud Particle Imagery</title>

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view. A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$, relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19, significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page: https://choreomuse.github.io.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment, undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge. This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore, to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11 tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline (AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for clinical decision support.

<title>Taming Domain Shift in Multi-source CT-Scan Classification via Input-Space Standardization</title>

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling (KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself. The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

<title>ConSeg: Contextual Backdoor Attack Against Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate (ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

<title>A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations. We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$, respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for 8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns, and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges, and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26% to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart accuracy. We release Text2Vis at https://github.com/vis-nlp/Text2Vis.

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data, contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying (FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a verification and validation (V&amp;V) process that bridges simulation and real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified, end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using significantly fewer primitives.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules, paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction. We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score: 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges, pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3 are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold level and re- set mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss, while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs), but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training. Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training, finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance. Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or sufficient data.

Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are significantly more complex.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

<title>Model-Agnostic Gender Bias Control for Text-to-Image Generation via Sparse Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The project page is available at HERE.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have unveiled great potential as visual assistants. However, most existing works focus on responding to individual instructions or using previous dialogues for contextual understanding. There is little discussion on employing both images and text as in-context examples to enhance the instruction following capability.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Otter} model to leverage both textual and visual in-context examples for instruction tuning. Specifically, Otter builds upon Flamingo with Perceiver architecture, and has been instruction tuned for general purpose multi-modal assistant. Otter seamlessly processes multi-modal inputs, supporting modalities including text, multiple images, and dynamic video content. To support the training of Otter, we present the \textbf{MIMIC-IT} (\textbf{M}ult\textbf{I}-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{T}uning) dataset, which encompasses over 3 million multi-modal instruction-response pairs, including approximately 2.2 million unique instructions across a broad spectrum of images and videos. MIMIC-IT has been carefully curated to feature a diverse array of in-context examples for each entry.
  Comprehensive evaluations suggest that instruction tuning with these in-context examples substantially enhances model convergence and generalization capabilities. Notably, the extensive scenario coverage provided by the MIMIC-IT dataset empowers the Otter model to excel in tasks involving complex video and multi-image understanding.

Abstract: Advancements in large pre-trained generative models have expanded their potential as effective data generators in visual recognition. This work delves into the impact of generative images, primarily comparing paradigms that harness external data (\ie generative \vs retrieval \vs original).
  Our key contributions are: \textbf{1) GenBench Construction:} We devise \textbf{GenBench}, a broad benchmark comprising 22 datasets with 2548 categories, to appraise generative data across various visual recognition tasks. \textbf{2) CLER Score:} To address the insufficient correlation of existing metrics (\eg, FID, CLIP score) with downstream recognition performance, we propose \textbf{CLER}, a training-free metric indicating generative data's efficiency for recognition tasks prior to training. \textbf{3) New Baselines:} Comparisons of generative data with retrieved data from the same external pool help to elucidate the unique traits of generative data. \textbf{4) External Knowledge Injection:} By fine-tuning special token embeddings for each category via Textual Inversion, performance improves across 17 datasets, except when dealing with low-resolution reference images.
  Our exhaustive benchmark and analysis spotlight generative data's promise in visual recognition, while identifying key challenges for future investigation.

<title>Point Cloud Self-supervised Learning via 3D to Multi-view Masked Learner</title>

Abstract: Recently, multi-modal masked autoencoders (MAE) has been introduced in 3D self-supervised learning, offering enhanced feature learning by leveraging both 2D and 3D data to capture richer cross-modal representations. However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales. Additionally, a novel two-stage self-training strategy is proposed to align 2D and 3D representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across various downstream tasks, including 3D classification, part segmentation, and object detection.

Abstract: Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\% on Human3.6M.

Abstract: Many animal species can approximately judge the number of objects in a visual scene at a single glance, and humans can further determine the exact cardinality of a set by deploying systematic counting procedures. In contrast, it has been observed that even state-of-the-art AI systems have very limited enumeration skills. In this work, we propose two benchmark tasks inspired by cognitive science that allow to precisely evaluate the visual enumeration capabilities of multimodal foundation models, thereby providing an objective measure of their number sense and counting level. We consider popular visual question answering models (BLIP, LLaVA and ViLT) as well as advanced image-to-text (Gemini, GPT and Qwen) and text-to-image (DALL-E, FLUX and Stable Diffusion) AI systems. Our analyses show that even the most advanced models cannot reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items, as indexed by their low accuracy in both types of tasks. Especially for numbers outside the subitizing range, their responses are often far from the target numerosity, and, in stark contrast with human behavior, in many cases the distribution of errors depends on the object category. We also observe some striking mistakes with small numbers. Our findings demonstrate that developing an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for AI models and that merely increasing model size might not be a viable strategy to promote the emergence of systematic counting skills. We release the full code of our benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of enumeration skills in future AI systems.

Abstract: Prior-based methods for low-light image enhancement often face challenges in extracting available prior information from dim images. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a simple yet effective Retinex model with the proposed edge extraction prior. More specifically, we design an edge extraction network to capture the fine edge features from the low-light image directly. Building upon the Retinex theory, we decompose the low-light image into its illumination and reflectance components and introduce an edge-guided Retinex model for enhancing low-light images. To solve the proposed model, we propose a novel inertial Bregman alternating linearized minimization algorithm. This algorithm addresses the optimization problem associated with the edge-guided Retinex model, enabling effective enhancement of low-light images. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish the convergence properties of the algorithm. Besides, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the problem through nonconvex optimization theory. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world low-light image datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exhibit sub-optimal performance under covariate and category shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) presents a promising solution to this dilemma, yet most SFDA approaches are restricted to closed-set scenarios. In this paper, we explore Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) aiming to accurately classify "known" data belonging to common categories and segregate them from target-private "unknown" data. We propose a novel Global and Local Clustering (GLC) technique, which comprises an adaptive one-vs-all global clustering algorithm to discern between target classes, complemented by a local k-NN clustering strategy to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the effectiveness, the inherent closed-set source architecture leads to uniform treatment of "unknown" data, impeding the identification of distinct "unknown" categories. To address this, we evolve GLC to GLC++, integrating a contrastive affinity learning strategy. We examine the superiority of GLC and GLC++ across multiple benchmarks and category shift scenarios. Remarkably, in the most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by 16.8\% and 18.9\% in H-score on VisDA, respectively. GLC++ enhances the novel category clustering accuracy of GLC by 4.1\% in open-set scenarios on Office-Home. Furthermore, the introduced contrastive learning strategy not only enhances GLC but also significantly facilitates existing methodologies.

Abstract: Classification of pathological images is the basis for automatic cancer diagnosis. Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo-labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain gap between the pre-training and target datasets. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach that contains two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo-labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo-labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo-labels. We further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision by to learn from samples with reliable pseudo-labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Additionally, we present an innovative open-set prompting strategy that filters irrelevant patches from whole slides to enhance the quality of selected patches. Experimental results on five public pathological image datasets for patch-level and slide-level classification showed that our method substantially outperformed zero-shot classification by VLMs, and was superior to existing noisy label learning methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/VLM-CPL.

Abstract: In the computer vision literature, many effective histogram-based features have been developed. These engineered features include local binary patterns and edge histogram descriptors among others and they have been shown to be informative features for a variety of computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore whether these features can be learned through histogram layers embedded in a neural network and, therefore, be leveraged within deep learning frameworks. By using histogram features, local statistics of the feature maps from the convolution neural networks can be used to better represent the data. We present neural versions of local binary pattern and edge histogram descriptors that jointly improve the feature representation and perform image classification. Experiments are presented on benchmark and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Given a query consisting of a reference image and a relative caption, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images visually similar to the reference one while incorporating the changes specified in the relative caption. The reliance of supervised methods on labor-intensive manually labeled datasets hinders their broad applicability. In this work, we introduce a new task, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR), that addresses CIR without the need for a labeled training dataset. We propose an approach named iSEARLE (improved zero-Shot composEd imAge Retrieval with textuaL invErsion) that involves mapping the visual information of the reference image into a pseudo-word token in CLIP token embedding space and combining it with the relative caption. To foster research on ZS-CIR, we present an open-domain benchmarking dataset named CIRCO (Composed Image Retrieval on Common Objects in context), the first CIR dataset where each query is labeled with multiple ground truths and a semantic categorization. The experimental results illustrate that iSEARLE obtains state-of-the-art performance on three different CIR datasets -- FashionIQ, CIRR, and the proposed CIRCO -- and two additional evaluation settings, namely domain conversion and object composition. The dataset, the code, and the model are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE.

Abstract: In the character animation field, modern supervised keyframe interpolation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in constructing natural human motions from sparse pose definitions. As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has driven many successes in a variety of tasks within the field of deep learning, in particular the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) culminating with large language models (LLM). Adding to that success, transformer architecture has found widespread interest from computer vision (CV) researchers and practitioners, allowing for many advancements in vision-related tasks and opening the door for multitask and multi-modal deep learning architectures that share the same principle of operation. One drawback to these architectures is their reliance on the scaled dot product attention mechanism with the softmax activation function, which is computationally expensive and requires large compute capabilities for both training and inference. This paper investigates substituting the MLP and attention mechanism usually adopted for transformer architecture with an architecture based on incorporating a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function structure with the aim of reducing the computational cost. The equalized experimental assessments conducted in this work show that the proposed modification with the targeted reductions in computational complexity offers competitive performance compared to the selected baseline architectures. The results are significantly in support of the aims of this work, in which the focus was to extensively utilize GLU-based MLPs, establishing a more efficient but capable alternative to the traditional MLP and the attention mechanism as the core component in the design of transformer architectures.

Abstract: Deepfakes represent a growing concern across domains such as impostor hiring, fraud, and disinformation. Despite significant efforts to develop robust detection classifiers to distinguish the real from the fake, commonly used training datasets remain inadequate: relying on low-quality and outdated deepfake generators, consisting of content scraped from online repositories without participant consent, lacking in multimodal coverage, and rarely employing identity-matching protocols to ensure realistic fakes. To overcome these limitations, we present the DeepSpeak dataset, a diverse and multimodal dataset comprising over 100 hours of authentic and deepfake audiovisual content. We contribute: i) more than 50 hours of real, self-recorded data collected from 500 diverse and consenting participants using a custom-built data collection tool, ii) more than 50 hours of state-of-the-art audio and visual deepfakes generated using 14 video synthesis engines and three voice cloning engines, and iii) an embedding-based, identity-matching approach to ensure the creation of convincing, high-quality identity swaps that realistically simulate adversarial deepfake attacks. We also perform large-scale evaluations of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors and show that, without retraining, these detectors fail to generalize to the DeepSpeak dataset. These evaluations highlight the importance of a large and diverse dataset containing deepfakes from the latest generative-AI tools.

Abstract: Recent research on knowledge distillation has increasingly focused on logit distillation because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility in model compression. In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods. Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating an exacerbated divergence between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss, which can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives. Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlations. In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits. In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD.

Abstract: Multi-task dense scene understanding, which trains a model for multiple dense prediction tasks, has a wide range of application scenarios. Capturing long-range dependency and enhancing cross-task interactions are crucial to multi-task dense prediction. In this paper, we propose MTMamba++, a novel architecture for multi-task scene understanding featuring with a Mamba-based decoder. It contains two types of core blocks: self-task Mamba (STM) block and cross-task Mamba (CTM) block. STM handles long-range dependency by leveraging state-space models, while CTM explicitly models task interactions to facilitate information exchange across tasks. We design two types of CTM block, namely F-CTM and S-CTM, to enhance cross-task interaction from feature and semantic perspectives, respectively. Extensive experiments on NYUDv2, PASCAL-Context, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MTMamba++ over CNN-based, Transformer-based, and diffusion-based methods while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Joint Energy Models (JEMs), while drawing significant research attention, have not been successfully scaled to real-world, high-resolution datasets. We present CLIP-JEM, a novel approach extending JEMs to the multimodal vision-language domain using CLIP, integrating both generative and discriminative objectives. For the generative one, we introduce an image-text joint-energy function based on Cosine similarity in the CLIP space, training CLIP to assign low energy to real image-caption pairs and high energy otherwise. For the discriminative one, we employ contrastive adversarial loss, extending the adversarial training objective to the multimodal domain. CLIP-JEM not only generates realistic images from text but also achieves competitive results on the compositionality benchmark, outperforming leading methods with fewer parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior guidance capability of CLIP-JEM by enhancing CLIP-based generative frameworks and converting unconditional diffusion models to text-based ones. Lastly, we show that our model can serve as a more robust evaluation metric for text-to-image generative tasks than CLIP.

Abstract: We aim to address sparse-view reconstruction of a 3D scene by leveraging priors from large-scale vision models. While recent advancements such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable successes in 3D reconstruction, these methods typically necessitate hundreds of input images that densely capture the underlying scene, making them time-consuming and impractical for real-world applications. However, sparse-view reconstruction is inherently ill-posed and under-constrained, often resulting in inferior and incomplete outcomes. This is due to issues such as failed initialization, overfitting on input images, and a lack of details. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce LM-Gaussian, a method capable of generating high-quality reconstructions from a limited number of images. Specifically, we propose a robust initialization module that leverages stereo priors to aid in the recovery of camera poses and the reliable point clouds. Additionally, a diffusion-based refinement is iteratively applied to incorporate image diffusion priors into the Gaussian optimization process to preserve intricate scene details. Finally, we utilize video diffusion priors to further enhance the rendered images for realistic visual effects. Overall, our approach significantly reduces the data acquisition requirements compared to previous 3DGS methods. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on various public datasets, demonstrating its potential for high-quality 360-degree scene reconstruction. Visual results are on our website.

Abstract: Nowadays, pre-trained encoders are widely used in medical image segmentation due to their strong capability in extracting rich and generalized feature representations. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage these features, limiting segmentation performance. In this work, a novel U-shaped model is proposed to address the above issue, including three plug-and-play modules. A channel spatial interaction module is introduced to improve the quality of skip connection features by modeling inter-stage interactions between the encoder and decoder. A channel attention-based module integrating squeeze-and-excitation mechanisms with convolutional layers is employed in the decoder blocks to strengthen the representation of critical features while suppressing irrelevant ones. A multi-level fusion module is designed to aggregate multi-scale decoder features, improving spatial detail and consistency in the final prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset and automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest average Dice score of 86.05% and 92.58%, yielding improvements of 1.15% and 0.26%, respectively. In addition, the proposed model provides a balance between accuracy and computational complexity, with only 86.91 million parameters and 23.26 giga floating-point operations.

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-training techniques to enhance point cloud models has become a prominent research topic. However, existing approaches typically require full fine-tuning of pre-trained models to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, which is storage-intensive and computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for point cloud, called \textbf{PointGST} (\textbf{Point} cloud \textbf{G}raph \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{T}uning). PointGST freezes the pre-trained model and introduces a lightweight, trainable Point Cloud Spectral Adapter (PCSA) for fine-tuning parameters in the spectral domain. The core idea is built on two observations: 1) The inner tokens from frozen models might present confusion in the spatial domain; 2) Task-specific intrinsic information is important for transferring the general knowledge to the downstream task. Specifically, PointGST transfers the point tokens from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, effectively de-correlating confusion among tokens by using orthogonal components for separation. Moreover, the generated spectral basis involves intrinsic information about the downstream point clouds, enabling more targeted tuning. As a result, PointGST facilitates the efficient transfer of general knowledge to downstream tasks while significantly reducing training costs. Extensive experiments on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that PointGST not only outperforms its fully fine-tuning counterpart but also significantly reduces trainable parameters, making it a promising solution for efficient point cloud learning. The code will be made available at https://github.com/jerryfeng2003/PointGST

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have improved the quality of synthesized images, but evaluations mainly focus on aesthetics or alignment with text prompts. Thus, it remains unclear whether these models can accurately represent a wide variety of realistic visual entities. To bridge this gap, we propose KITTEN, a benchmark for Knowledge-InTensive image generaTion on real-world ENtities. Using KITTEN, we conduct a systematic study of the latest text-to-image models and retrieval-augmented models, focusing on their ability to generate real-world visual entities, such as landmarks and animals. Analysis using carefully designed human evaluations, automatic metrics, and MLLM evaluations show that even advanced text-to-image models fail to generate accurate visual details of entities. While retrieval-augmented models improve entity fidelity by incorporating reference images, they tend to over-rely on them and struggle to create novel configurations of the entity in creative text prompts.

Abstract: We address the problem of extending the capabilities of vision foundation models such as DINO, SAM, and CLIP, to 3D tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel method to uplift 2D image features into Gaussian Splatting representations of 3D scenes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on minimizing a reconstruction loss, our method employs a simpler and more efficient feature aggregation technique, augmented by a graph diffusion mechanism. Graph diffusion refines 3D features, such as coarse segmentation masks, by leveraging 3D geometry and pairwise similarities induced by DINOv2. Our approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on multiple downstream tasks while delivering significant speed-ups. Notably, we obtain competitive segmentation results using only generic DINOv2 features, despite DINOv2 not being trained on millions of annotated segmentation masks like SAM. When applied to CLIP features, our method demonstrates strong performance in open-vocabulary object segmentation tasks, highlighting the versatility of our approach.

Abstract: Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for a wide range of applications, significantly when leveraging the power of multi-loss functions to optimize performance on multiple criteria simultaneously. However, optimal selection and weighting loss functions in deep learning tasks can significantly influence model performance, yet manual tuning of these functions is often inefficient and inflexible. We propose a novel framework called dynamic memory fusion for adaptive multi-loss function penalizing in real-time to address this. This framework leverages historical loss values data to dynamically adjust the weighting of multiple loss functions throughout the training process. Additionally, this framework integrates an auxiliary loss function to enhance model performance in the early stages. To further research horizons, we introduce the class-balanced dice loss function, designed to address class imbalance by prioritizing underrepresented classes. Experiments on breast ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the framework improves segmentation performance across various metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in ensuring that the model dynamically adjusts its focus to prioritize the most relevant criteria, leading to improved performance in evolving environments. The source code for our proposed methodology is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: We present DeSiRe-GS, a self-supervised gaussian splatting representation, enabling effective static-dynamic decomposition and high-fidelity surface reconstruction in complex driving scenarios. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization pipeline of dynamic street Gaussians. In the first stage, we extract 2D motion masks based on the observation that 3D Gaussian Splatting inherently can reconstruct only the static regions in dynamic environments. These extracted 2D motion priors are then mapped into the Gaussian space in a differentiable manner, leveraging an efficient formulation of dynamic Gaussians in the second stage. Combined with the introduced geometric regularizations, our method are able to address the over-fitting issues caused by data sparsity in autonomous driving, reconstructing physically plausible Gaussians that align with object surfaces rather than floating in air. Furthermore, we introduce temporal cross-view consistency to ensure coherence across time and viewpoints, resulting in high-quality surface reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DeSiRe-GS, surpassing prior self-supervised arts and achieving accuracy comparable to methods relying on external 3D bounding box annotations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.

Abstract: Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.

Abstract: We propose Quadratic Gaussian Splatting (QGS), a novel representation that replaces static primitives with deformable quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipse, paraboloids) to capture intricate geometry. Unlike prior works that rely on Euclidean distance for primitive density modeling--a metric misaligned with surface geometry under deformation--QGS introduces geodesic distance-based density distributions. This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection. Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and MipNeRF360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art surface reconstruction, with QGS reducing geometric error (chamfer distance) by 33% over 2DGS and 27% over GOF on the DTU dataset. Crucially, QGS retains competitive appearance quality, bridging the gap between geometric precision and visual fidelity for applications like robotics and immersive reality.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of deep learning, there is an increasing availability of open-source models for various tasks. However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.

Abstract: We introduce MUSE-VL, a Unified Vision-Language Model through Semantic discrete Encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, the research community has begun exploring unified models for visual generation and understanding. However, existing vision tokenizers (e.g., VQGAN) only consider low-level information, which makes it difficult to align with language tokens. This results in high training complexity and necessitates a large amount of training data to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, their performance is still far from dedicated understanding models. This paper proposes Semantic Discrete Encoding (SDE), which effectively aligns the information of visual tokens and language tokens by adding semantic constraints to the visual tokenizer. This greatly reduces the amount of training data and improves the performance of the unified model. With the same LLM size, our method improved the understanding performance by 4.8% compared to the previous SOTA Emu3 and surpassed the dedicated understanding model LLaVA-NeXT 34B by 3.7%. Our model also surpasses the existing unified models on visual generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-based person search aims to retrieve specific individuals across camera networks using natural language descriptions. However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios. To meet such demands, we propose a new task, text-based person anomaly search, locating pedestrians engaged in both routine or anomalous activities via text. To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval, and the proposed pose-aware method arrives at 84.93% recall@1 accuracy, surpassing other competitive methods. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/CMP.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training 3D image-conditioned diffusion models using only 2D supervision. Recovering 3D structure from 2D images is inherently ill-posed due to the ambiguity of possible reconstructions, making generative models a natural choice. However, most existing 3D generative models rely on full 3D supervision, which is impractical due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. To address this, we propose leveraging sparse-view supervision as a scalable alternative. While recent reconstruction models use sparse-view supervision with differentiable rendering to lift 2D images to 3D, they are predominantly deterministic, failing to capture the diverse set of plausible solutions and producing blurry predictions in uncertain regions. A key challenge in training 3D diffusion models with 2D supervision is that the standard training paradigm requires both the denoising process and supervision to be in the same modality. We address this by decoupling the noisy samples being denoised from the supervision signal, allowing the former to remain in 3D while the latter is provided in 2D. Our approach leverages suboptimal predictions from a deterministic image-to-3D model-acting as a "teacher"-to generate noisy 3D inputs, enabling effective 3D diffusion training without requiring full 3D ground truth. We validate our framework on both object-level and scene-level datasets, using two different 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) teachers. Our results show that our approach consistently improves upon these deterministic teachers, demonstrating its effectiveness in scalable and high-fidelity 3D generative modeling.

Abstract: Tracking Any Point (TAP) plays a crucial role in motion analysis. Video-based approaches rely on iterative local matching for tracking, but they assume linear motion during the blind time between frames, which leads to point loss under large displacements or nonlinear motion. The high temporal resolution and motion blur-free characteristics of event cameras provide continuous, fine-grained motion information, capturing subtle variations with microsecond precision. This paper presents an event-based framework for tracking any point, which tackles the challenges posed by spatial sparsity and motion sensitivity in events through two tailored modules. Specifically, to resolve ambiguities caused by event sparsity, a motion-guidance module incorporates kinematic vectors into the local matching process. Additionally, a variable motion aware module is integrated to ensure temporally consistent responses that are insensitive to varying velocities, thereby enhancing matching precision. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, two event dataset for tracking any point is constructed by simulation. The method improves the $Survival_{50}$ metric by 17.9% over event-only tracking of any point baseline. Moreover, on standard feature tracking benchmarks, it outperforms all existing methods, even those that combine events and video frames.

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose BadPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using BadPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.

Abstract: Transformers are widely used for their ability to capture data relations in sequence processing, with great success for a wide range of static tasks. However, the computational and memory footprint of their main component, i.e., the Scaled Dot-product Attention, is commonly overlooked. This makes their adoption in applications involving stream data processing with constraints in response latency, computational and memory resources infeasible. Some works have proposed methods to lower the computational cost of Transformers, i.e. low-rank approximations, sparsity in attention, and efficient formulations for Continual Inference. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of the Scaled Dot-product Attention based on the Nystr\"om approximation that is suitable for Continual Inference. In experiments on Online Audio Classification and Online Action Detection tasks, the proposed Continual Scaled Dot-product Attention can lower the number of operations by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the original Transformers while retaining the predictive performance of competing models.

Abstract: High-quality material generation is key for virtual environment authoring and inverse rendering. We propose MaterialPicker, a multi-modal material generator leveraging a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, improving and simplifying the creation of high-quality materials from text prompts and/or photographs. Our method can generate a material based on an image crop of a material sample, even if the captured surface is distorted, viewed at an angle or partially occluded, as is often the case in photographs of natural scenes. We further allow the user to specify a text prompt to provide additional guidance for the generation. We finetune a pre-trained DiT-based video generator into a material generator, where each material map is treated as a frame in a video sequence. We evaluate our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively and show that it enables more diverse material generation and better distortion correction than previous work.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning (TDP) aims to compromise the model's prediction on a specific (test) target by perturbing a small subset of training data. Existing work on TDP has focused on an overly ideal threat model in which the same image sample of the target is used during both poisoning and inference stages. However, in the real world, a target object often appears in complex variations due to changes of physical settings such as viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. In this work, we take the first step toward understanding the real-world threats of TDP by studying its generalizability across varying physical conditions. In particular, we observe that solely optimizing gradient directions, as adopted by the best previous TDP method, achieves limited generalization. To address this limitation, we propose optimizing both the gradient direction and magnitude for more generalizable gradient matching, thereby leading to higher poisoning success rates. For instance, our method outperforms the state of the art by 19.49% when poisoning CIFAR-10 images targeting multi-view cars.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) underscore the importance of scaling by increasing image-text paired data, achieving impressive performance on general tasks. Despite their effectiveness in broad applications, generalist models are primarily trained on web-scale datasets dominated by natural images, resulting in the sacrifice of specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks that require extensive domain prior knowledge. Moreover, directly integrating expert models tailored for specific domains is challenging due to the representational gap and imbalanced optimization between the generalist model and experts. To address these challenges, we introduce Chimera, a scalable and low-cost multi-modal pipeline designed to boost the ability of existing LMMs with domain-specific experts. Specifically, we design a progressive training strategy to integrate features from expert models into the input of a generalist LMM. To address the imbalanced optimization caused by the well-aligned general visual encoder, we introduce a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism. This results in a versatile model that excels across the chart, table, math, and document domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal reasoning and visual content extraction tasks, both of which are challenging tasks for assessing existing LMMs.

Abstract: Modeling 3D human-object interaction (HOI) is a problem of great interest for computer vision and a key enabler for virtual and mixed-reality applications. Existing methods work in a one-way direction: some recover plausible human interactions conditioned on a 3D object; others recover the object pose conditioned on a human pose. Instead, we provide the first unified model - TriDi which works in any direction. Concretely, we generate Human, Object, and Interaction modalities simultaneously with a new three-way diffusion process, allowing to model seven distributions with one network. We implement TriDi as a transformer attending to the various modalities' tokens, thereby discovering conditional relations between them. The user can control the interaction either as a text description of HOI or a contact map. We embed these two representations into a shared latent space, combining the practicality of text descriptions with the expressiveness of contact maps. Using a single network, TriDi unifies all the special cases of prior work and extends to new ones, modeling a family of seven distributions. Remarkably, despite using a single model, TriDi generated samples surpass one-way specialized baselines on GRAB and BEHAVE in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics, and demonstrating better diversity. We show the applicability of TriDi to scene population, generating objects for human-contact datasets, and generalization to unseen object geometry.

Abstract: Video try-on stands as a promising area for its tremendous real-world potential. Previous research on video try-on has primarily focused on transferring product clothing images to videos with simple human poses, while performing poorly with complex movements. To better preserve clothing details, those approaches are armed with an additional garment encoder, resulting in higher computational resource consumption. The primary challenges in this domain are twofold: (1) leveraging the garment encoder's capabilities in video try-on while lowering computational requirements; (2) ensuring temporal consistency in the synthesis of human body parts, especially during rapid movements. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel video try-on framework based on Diffusion Transformer(DiT), named Dynamic Try-On.
  To reduce computational overhead, we adopt a straightforward approach by utilizing the DiT backbone itself as the garment encoder and employing a dynamic feature fusion module to store and integrate garment features. To ensure temporal consistency of human body parts, we introduce a limb-aware dynamic attention module that enforces the DiT backbone to focus on the regions of human limbs during the denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic Try-On in generating stable and smooth try-on results, even for videos featuring complicated human postures.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, yet evaluating these methods remains challenging for two reasons: i) Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluation on different prompt categories and evaluation dimensions. ii) Previous evaluation metrics only focus on a single aspect (e.g., text-3D alignment) and fail to perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. To address these problems, we first propose a comprehensive benchmark named MATE-3D. The benchmark contains eight well-designed prompt categories that cover single and multiple object generation, resulting in 1,280 generated textured meshes. We have conducted a large-scale subjective experiment from four different evaluation dimensions and collected 107,520 annotations, followed by detailed analyses of the results. Based on MATE-3D, we propose a novel quality evaluator named HyperScore. Utilizing hypernetwork to generate specified mapping functions for each evaluation dimension, our metric can effectively perform multi-dimensional quality assessment. HyperScore presents superior performance over existing metrics on MATE-3D, making it a promising metric for assessing and improving text-to-3D generation.

Abstract: While haircut indicates distinct personality, existing avatar generation methods fail to model practical hair due to the data limitation or entangled representation. We propose StrandHead, a novel text-driven method capable of generating 3D hair strands and disentangled head avatars with strand-level attributes. Instead of using large-scale hair-text paired data for supervision, we demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by distilling 2D generative models pre-trained on human mesh data. To this end, we propose a meshing approach guided by strand geometry to guarantee the gradient flow from the distillation objective to the neural strand representation. The optimization is then regularized by statistically significant haircut features, leading to stable updating of strands against unreasonable drifting. These employed 2D/3D human-centric priors contribute to text-aligned and realistic 3D strand generation. Extensive experiments show that StrandHead achieves the state-of-the-art performance on text to strand generation and disentangled 3D head avatar modeling. The generated 3D hair can be applied on avatars for strand-level editing, as well as implemented in the graphics engine for physical simulation or other applications.

Abstract: This paper expands the cascaded network branch of the autoencoder-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework for dynamic facial expression recognition, namely Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (MTCAE-DFER). MTCAE-DFER builds a plug-and-play cascaded decoder module, which is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and employs the decoder concept of Transformer to reconstruct the multi-head attention module. The decoder output from the previous task serves as the query (Q), representing local dynamic features, while the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) shared encoder output acts as both the key (K) and value (V), representing global dynamic features. This setup facilitates interaction between global and local dynamic features across related tasks. Additionally, this proposal aims to alleviate overfitting of complex large model. We utilize autoencoder-based multi-task cascaded learning approach to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on dynamic facial expression recognition, which enhances the model's generalization ability. After we conduct extensive ablation experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition, the robustness of the MTCAE-DFER model and the effectiveness of global-local dynamic feature interaction among related tasks have been proven.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical imaging, addressing the chronic challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. While SSL has shown impressive results, existing studies in the medical domain are often limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets or modalities, or evaluating only isolated aspects of model performance. This fragmented evaluation approach poses a significant challenge, as models deployed in critical medical settings must not only achieve high accuracy but also demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse datasets and varying conditions. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods within the medical domain, with a particular focus on robustness and generalizability. Using the MedMNIST dataset collection as a standardized benchmark, we evaluate 8 major SSL methods across 11 different medical datasets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of model performance in both in-domain scenarios and the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, while exploring the effect of various initialization strategies, model architectures, and multi-domain pre-training. We further assess the generalizability of SSL methods through cross-dataset evaluations and the in-domain performance with varying label proportions (1%, 10%, and 100%) to simulate real-world scenarios with limited supervision. We hope this comprehensive benchmark helps practitioners and researchers make more informed decisions when applying SSL methods to medical applications.

Abstract: Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Illegal souvenir collection strips an estimated five tonnes of seashells from Costa Rica's beaches each year. Yet, once these specimens are seized, their coastal origin -- Pacific or Caribbean -- cannot be verified easily due to the lack of information, preventing their return when confiscated by local authorities. To solve this issue, we introduce BackHome19K, the first large-scale image corpus (19{,}058 photographs, 516 species) annotated with coast-level labels, and propose a lightweight pipeline that infers provenance in real time on a mobile-grade CPU. A trained anomaly filter pre-screens uploads, increasing robustness to user-generated noise. On a held-out test set, the classifier attains 86.3\% balanced accuracy, while the filter rejects 93\% of 180 out-of-domain objects with zero false negatives. Deployed as a web application, the system has already processed 70{,}000 shells for wildlife officers in under three seconds per image, enabling confiscated specimens to be safely repatriated to their native ecosystems. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FIFCO/BackHome19K

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting significant societal risks, such as misinformation and deception. As a result, detecting AI-generated images has emerged as a critical challenge. Existing researches emphasize extracting fine-grained features to enhance detector generalization, yet they often lack consideration for the importance and interdependencies of internal elements within local regions and are limited to a single frequency domain, hindering the capture of general forgery traces. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we first utilize a sliding window to restrict the attention mechanism to a local window, and reconstruct the features within the window to model the relationships between neighboring internal elements within the local region. Then, we design a dual frequency domain branch framework consisting of four frequency domain subbands of DWT and the phase part of FFT to enrich the extraction of local forgery features from different perspectives. Through feature enrichment of dual frequency domain branches and fine-grained feature extraction of reconstruction sliding window attention, our method achieves superior generalization detection capabilities on both GAN and diffusion model-based generative images. Evaluated on diverse datasets comprising images from 65 distinct generative models, our approach achieves a 2.13\% improvement in detection accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual Learning in Visual Question Answering (VQACL) requires models to acquire new visual-linguistic skills (plasticity) while preserving previously learned knowledge (stability). The inherent multimodality of VQACL exacerbates this challenge, as models must balance stability across visual and textual domains while adapting to novel objects and reasoning tasks. Existing methods, primarily designed for unimodal settings, often fall short in addressing this dual requirement. In this work, we present QUestion-only replay with Attention Distillation (QUAD), a novel approach for VQACL that leverages only past task questions for regularization. By eliminating the need to store visual data, QUAD not only reduces memory overhead, but also alleviates privacy concerns. Our method introduces a Question-only Replay mechanism that selectively reuses prior task questions to counteract overfitting to the answer space of the current task, addressing the problem out of answer set. Complementing this, we propose Attention Consistency Distillation to enforce both intra-modal and inter-modal attention consistency across tasks, preserving essential visual-linguistic associations. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and NExT-QA demonstrate that QUAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust performance in continual VQA.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for spatiotemporal multi-camera calibration using freely moving people in multiview videos. Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.

Abstract: Assessing whether AI-generated images are substantially similar to source works is a crucial step in resolving copyright disputes. In this paper, we propose CopyJudge, a novel automated infringement identification framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework based on the multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide detailed judgment rationales. Based on these judgments, we further introduce a general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing content. Furthermore, assuming the input noise is controllable, our approach can be enhanced by iteratively exploring non-infringing noise vectors within the diffusion latent space, even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our automated identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of infringement, and that our mitigation method more effectively mitigates memorization and IP infringement with a high degree of alignment to the original non-infringing expressions.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in diffusion-based image generation, subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing remain challenging. Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

Abstract: This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.

Abstract: Recovering absolute human motion from monocular inputs is challenging due to two main issues. First, existing methods depend on 3D training data collected from limited environments, constraining out-of-distribution generalization. The second issue is the difficulty of estimating metric-scale poses from monocular input. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging 2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D motions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose complex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses. We first pretrain a single-view diffusion model on extensive 2D datasets, then fine-tune a multi-view model using public 3D data to enable view-consistent motion generation from monocular input, allowing the model to acquire action priors and diversity through 2D data. Furthermore, to recover absolute poses, we propose a novel human motion representation that decouples the learning of local pose and global movements, while encoding geometric priors of the ground to accelerate convergence. This enables progressive recovery of motion in absolute space during inference. Experimental results on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both camera-space motion realism and world-grounded human positioning, while exhibiting superior generalization capability. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment and track a target object in a video using a natural language prompt. Existing methods typically fuse visual and textual features in a highly entangled manner, processing multi-modal information together to generate per-frame masks. However, this approach often struggles with ambiguous target identification, particularly in scenes with multiple similar objects, and fails to ensure consistent mask propagation across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce FindTrack, an efficient decoupled framework that separates target identification from mask propagation. FindTrack first adaptively selects a key frame by balancing segmentation confidence and vision-text alignment, establishing a robust reference for the target object. This reference is then utilized by a dedicated propagation module to track and segment the object across the entire video. By decoupling these processes, FindTrack effectively reduces ambiguities in target association and enhances segmentation consistency. FindTrack significantly outperforms all existing methods on public benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority.

Abstract: Loop closures are essential for correcting odometry drift and creating consistent maps, especially in the context of large-scale navigation. Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we empirically show that different timesteps of DDIM inversion reveal varying subtle distinctions between synthetic and real images that are extractable for detection, in the forms of such as Fourier power spectrum high-frequency discrepancies and inter-pixel variance distributions. Based on these observations, we propose a novel synthetic image detection method that directly utilizes features of intermediately noised images by training an ensemble on multiple noised timesteps, circumventing conventional reconstruction-based strategies. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce a metric-grounded explanation generation and refinement module to identify and explain AI-generated flaws. Additionally, we construct the GenHard and GenExplain benchmarks to provide detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and challenging samples respectively, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) aims to segment target objects in remote sensing (RS) images based on textual descriptions. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable performance in various segmentation tasks, its application to RRSIS presents several challenges, including understanding the text-described RS scenes and generating effective prompts from text descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RS2-SAM2, a novel framework that adapts SAM2 to RRSIS by aligning the adapted RS features and textual features, providing pseudo-mask-based dense prompts, and enforcing boundary constraints. Specifically, we employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. A bidirectional hierarchical fusion module is introduced to adapt SAM2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. To provide precise target cues for SAM2, we design a mask prompt generator, which takes the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produces a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM2. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce a novel visual tokenization framework that embeds a provable PCA-like structure into the latent token space. While existing visual tokenizers primarily optimize for reconstruction fidelity, they often neglect the structural properties of the latent space--a critical factor for both interpretability and downstream tasks. Our method generates a 1D causal token sequence for images, where each successive token contributes non-overlapping information with mathematically guaranteed decreasing explained variance, analogous to principal component analysis. This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information. Additionally, we identified and resolved a semantic-spectrum coupling effect that causes the unwanted entanglement of high-level semantic content and low-level spectral details in the tokens by leveraging a diffusion decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and enables better interpretability to align with the human vision system. Moreover, autoregressive models trained on our token sequences achieve performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer tokens for training and inference.

Abstract: In filmmaking, directors typically allow actors to perform freely based on the script before providing specific guidance on how to present key actions. AI-generated content faces similar requirements, where users not only need automatic generation of lip synchronization and basic gestures from audio input but also desire semantically accurate and expressive body movement that can be ``directly guided'' through text descriptions. Therefore, we present VersaAnimator, a versatile framework that synthesizes expressive talking human videos from arbitrary portrait images. Specifically, we design a motion generator that produces basic rhythmic movements from audio input and supports text-prompt control for specific actions. The generated whole-body 3D motion tokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads, half-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates photorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial expressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses. Furthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion tokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from direct 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body movements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes lip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and semantically meaningful whole-body motions.

Abstract: Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation.

Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of out of hospital cardiac arrest that requires fast diagnosis. While computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the standard diagnostic tool, it is not always accessible. Electrocardiography is an essential tool for diagnosing mul- tiple cardiac anomalies, as it is affordable, fast and available in many settings. However, the availability of public ECG datasets, specially for PE, is limited and, in practice, these datasets tend to be small, making it essential to optimize learning strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of multiple neural networks in order to assess the impact of various approaches. Moreover, we check whether these practices enhance model generalization when transfer learning is used to translate infor- mation learned in larger ECG datasets, such as PTB-XL, CPSC18 and MedalCare-XL, to a smaller, more challenging dataset for PE. By lever- aging transfer learning, we analyze the extent to which we can improve learning efficiency and predictive performance on limited data.

Abstract: In light of the mounting imperative for public security, the necessity for automated threat detection in high-risk scenarios is becoming increasingly pressing. However, existing methods generally suffer from the problems of uninterpretable inference and biased semantic understanding, which severely limits their reliability in practical deployment. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, this article proposes a threat detection method based on human-object interaction pairs (HOI-pairs), Hoi2Threat. This method is based on the fine-grained multimodal TD-Hoi dataset, enhancing the model's semantic modeling ability for key entities and their behavioral interactions by using structured HOI tags to guide language generation. Furthermore, a set of metrics is designed for the evaluation of text response quality, with the objective of systematically measuring the model's representation accuracy and comprehensibility during threat interpretation. The experimental results have demonstrated that Hoi2Threat attains substantial enhancement in several threat detection tasks, particularly in the core metrics of Correctness of Information (CoI), Behavioral Mapping Accuracy (BMA), and Threat Detailed Orientation (TDO), which are 5.08, 5.04, and 4.76, and 7.10%, 6.80%, and 2.63%, respectively, in comparison with the Gemma3 (4B). The aforementioned results provide comprehensive validation of the merits of this approach in the domains of semantic understanding, entity behavior mapping, and interpretability.

Abstract: As facial recognition is increasingly adopted for government and commercial services, its potential misuse has raised serious concerns about privacy and civil rights. To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Object Detection (MMOD), due to its stronger adaptability to various complex environments, has been widely applied in various applications. Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem, which arises from decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to a prevalent but unreasonable phenomenon\textemdash Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct a novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.

Abstract: Scaling up motion datasets is crucial to enhance motion generation capabilities. However, training on large-scale multi-source datasets introduces data heterogeneity challenges due to variations in motion content. To address this, we propose Generative Pretrained Multi-path Motion Model (GenM\(^3\)), a comprehensive framework designed to learn unified motion representations. GenM\(^3\) comprises two components: 1) a Multi-Expert VQ-VAE (MEVQ-VAE) that adapts to different dataset distributions to learn a unified discrete motion representation, and 2) a Multi-path Motion Transformer (MMT) that improves intra-modal representations by using separate modality-specific pathways, each with densely activated experts to accommodate variations within that modality, and improves inter-modal alignment by the text-motion shared pathway. To enable large-scale training, we integrate and unify 11 high-quality motion datasets (approximately 220 hours of motion data) and augment it with textual annotations (nearly 10,000 motion sequences labeled by a large language model and 300+ by human experts). After training on our integrated dataset, GenM\(^3\) achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 0.035 on the HumanML3D benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on IDEA400 dataset, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse motion scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.

Abstract: Deep neural networks trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) perform well when both training and test data come from the same domain, but they often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a Diffusion Driven Balancing (DDB) technique to generate training samples with text-to-image diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples in which this correlation does not exist. Our experiments show that across different benchmarks, our technique achieves better worst-group accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ArianYp/DDB.

Abstract: The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates zero-shot synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Notably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.

Abstract: 3D generation is experiencing rapid advancements, while the development of 3D evaluation has not kept pace. How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.

Abstract: Underwater dense prediction, especially depth estimation and semantic segmentation, is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of underwater scenes. Nevertheless, high-quality and large-scale underwater datasets with dense annotations remain scarce because of the complex environment and the exorbitant data collection costs. This paper proposes a unified Text-to-Image and DEnse annotation generation method (TIDE) for underwater scenes. It relies solely on text as input to simultaneously generate realistic underwater images and multiple highly consistent dense annotations. Specifically, we unify the generation of text-to-image and text-to-dense annotations within a single model. The Implicit Layout Sharing mechanism (ILS) and cross-modal interaction method called Time Adaptive Normalization (TAN) are introduced to jointly optimize the consistency between image and dense annotations. We synthesize a large-scale underwater dataset using TIDE to validate the effectiveness of our method in underwater dense prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of existing underwater dense prediction models and mitigates the scarcity of underwater data with dense annotations. We hope our method can offer new perspectives on alleviating data scarcity issues in other fields. The code is available at https://github.com/HongkLin/TIDE

<title>Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

<title>DSwinIR: Rethinking Window-based Attention for Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Image restoration has witnessed significant advancements with the development of deep learning models. Especially Transformer-based models, particularly those leveraging window-based self-attention, have become a dominant force in image restoration. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by the rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to two critical limitations: insufficient feature interaction across window boundaries and content-agnostic receptive fields that cannot adapt to diverse image structures. Existing methods often rely on heuristic patterns to mitigate these issues, rather than addressing the root cause. In this paper, we propose the Deformable Sliding Window Transformer (DSwinIR), a new foundational backbone architecture that systematically overcomes these limitations. At the heart of DSwinIR is the proposed novel Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention. This mechanism introduces two fundamental innovations. First, it replaces the rigid partitioning with a token-centric sliding window paradigm, ensuring seamless cross-window information flow and effectively eliminating boundary artifacts. Second, it incorporates a content-aware deformable sampling strategy, which allows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and dynamically shape its receptive fields to focus on the most informative image regions. This synthesis endows the model with both strong locality-aware inductive biases and powerful, adaptive long-range modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments show that DSwinIR sets a new state-of-the-art across a wide spectrum of image restoration tasks. For instance, in all-in-one restoration, our DSwinIR surpasses the most recent backbone GridFormer by over 0.53 dB on the three-task benchmark and a remarkable 0.86 dB on the five-task benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on developing datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting model robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To address, we introduce "Miscaption This!", a collection of LVLM-generated miscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better to real-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks. However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.

Abstract: Radar-based HAR has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional monitoring approaches, such as wearable devices and camera-based systems, due to its unique privacy preservation and robustness advantages. However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and State-Space Model (SSM) architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this paper, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach incorporates two key coordinated components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to construct the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attacks, achieving at least a +30.1% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) suffers from a key challenge in preserving old knowledge while adapting to new information. The existing solutions include rehearsal-based and rehearsal-free methods to address this challenge. Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation, continuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process. Rehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain, leading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores cross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution integration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a Text-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich prompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained representations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of identity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution awareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed to capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and adaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In this manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation learning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a Knowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level discrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate model adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote knowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific distributions, respectively. Experimental results show that our DAFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DAFC.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generative models have rapidly advanced and found widespread applications across fields like entertainment, education, and marketing. However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse. Our project page is at https://wrt2000.github.io/BadVideo2025/.

Abstract: Memes often merge visuals with brief text to share humor or opinions, yet some memes contain harmful messages such as hate speech. In this paper, we introduces MemeBLIP2, a light weight multimodal system that detects harmful memes by combining image and text features effectively. We build on previous studies by adding modules that align image and text representations into a shared space and fuse them for better classification. Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.

Abstract: With an ever-increasing availability of data, it has become more and more challenging to select and label appropriate samples for the training of machine learning models. It is especially difficult to detect long-tail classes of interest in large amounts of unlabeled data. This holds especially true for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where vehicle fleets and roadside perception systems generate an abundance of raw data. While industrial, proprietary data engines for such iterative data selection and model training processes exist, researchers and the open-source community suffer from a lack of an openly available system. We present the Mcity Data Engine, which provides modules for the complete data-based development cycle, beginning at the data acquisition phase and ending at the model deployment stage. The Mcity Data Engine focuses on rare and novel classes through an open-vocabulary data selection process.

Abstract: The widespread availability of video recording through smartphones and digital devices has made video-based evidence more accessible than ever. Surveillance footage plays a crucial role in security, law enforcement, and judicial processes. However, with the rise of advanced video editing tools, tampering with digital recordings has become increasingly easy, raising concerns about their authenticity. Ensuring the integrity of surveillance videos is essential, as manipulated footage can lead to misinformation and undermine judicial decisions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing forensic techniques used to detect video forgery, focusing on their effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of surveillance recordings. Various methods, including compression-based analysis, frame duplication detection, and machine learning-based approaches, are explored. The findings highlight the growing necessity for more robust forensic techniques to counteract evolving forgery methods. Strengthening video forensic capabilities will ensure that surveillance recordings remain credible and admissible as legal evidence.

Abstract: Accurate and privacy-preserving diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, particularly given the limitations of existing deep learning models in handling data imbalance, data privacy concerns, spatial feature diversity, and clinical interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Data efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) based framework that integrates context aware multiscale patch embedding, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), knowledge distillation, and federated learning to address these challenges in a unified manner. The proposed model effectively captures both local and global retinal features by leveraging multi scale patch representations with local and global attention mechanisms. LoRA integration enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of trainable parameters, while federated learning ensures secure, decentralized training without compromising data privacy. A knowledge distillation strategy further improves generalization in data scarce settings. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets OCTDL and the Eye Disease Image Dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms both traditional CNNs and state of the art transformer architectures across key metrics including AUC, F1 score, and precision. Furthermore, Grad-CAM++ visualizations provide interpretable insights into model predictions, supporting clinical trust. This work establishes a strong foundation for scalable, secure, and explainable AI applications in ophthalmic diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where minimizing operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific challenges due to limited computational power and bandwidth of edge devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such constraints by leveraging compact, efficient processing strategies. We evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the tradeoff between system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data. Current results show up to 80% reduction in end-to-end inference time, including edge processing, transmission, and server computation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a 3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions captured by the head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment with vision-language guidance. By assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. The learning process is enhanced using concurrently collected vision and language signals to improve multimodal alignment. The learned encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action recognition baselines.

In this work, we introduce BAGEL, an open-source foundational model that natively supports multimodal understanding and generation. BAGEL is a unified, decoder-only model pretrained on trillions of tokens curated from large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and web data. When scaled with such diverse multimodal interleaved data, BAGEL exhibits emerging capabilities in complex multimodal reasoning. As a result, it significantly outperforms open-source unified models in both multimodal generation and understanding across standard benchmarks, while exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities such as free-form image manipulation, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, and world navigation. In the hope of facilitating further opportunities for multimodal research, we share the key findings, pretraining details, data creation protocal, and release our code and checkpoints to the community.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity, along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription (Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based questions we created using NExT-QA. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.)

<title>FreeQ-Graph: Free-form Querying with Semantic Consistent Scene Graph for 3D Scene Understanding</title>

Abstract: Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features. However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels, which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation. Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

Abstract: While recent 3D generative models can produce high-quality texture images, they often fail to capture human preferences or meet task-specific requirements. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is that most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human feedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D texture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both geometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method generates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with desired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel geometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and interpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural language. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches. We will make our implementation code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yihong-97/UNLOCK.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved 2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts, variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/ZeroReg3D

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps. Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture, which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance. Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized AI, yet they struggle with zero-shot deployment in real-world industrial settings due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. To bridge this gap, Superb AI introduces ZERO, an industry-ready vision foundation model that leverages multi-modal prompting (textual and visual) for generalization without retraining. Trained on a compact yet representative 0.9 million annotated samples from a proprietary billion-scale industrial dataset, ZERO demonstrates competitive performance on academic benchmarks like LVIS-Val and significantly outperforms existing models across 37 diverse industrial datasets. Furthermore, ZERO achieved 2nd place in the CVPR 2025 Object Instance Detection Challenge and 4th place in the Foundational Few-shot Object Detection Challenge, highlighting its practical deployability and generalizability with minimal adaptation and limited data. To the best of our knowledge, ZERO is the first vision foundation model explicitly built for domain-specific, zero-shot industrial applications.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically to agriculture.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a 0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench, and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43 (+8.98%). Our code and models are available at https://github.com/SherryXTChen/ADIEE.git.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However, challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction, retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month) and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time, instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives, we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available at https://github.com/sprintml/finetuning_var_dp.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose SENTINEL (Sentence-level Early iNtervention Through IN-domain prEference Learning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/pspdada/SENTINEL.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the challenges of Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) methods for underwater robots. While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.

Abstract: This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.

Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.

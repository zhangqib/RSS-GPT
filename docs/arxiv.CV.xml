<div> Continuous variable, ethnicity labels, bias mitigation, face recognition models, dataset balance<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
In this paper, the authors address bias in face recognition models, specifically focusing on data bias related to ethnicity labels. They propose a new approach of treating ethnicity labels as a continuous variable rather than a discrete value for each identity. Through experimental and theoretical validation, they demonstrate that not all identities within the same ethnicity contribute equally to dataset balance. By training models on datasets balanced in the continuous space, they consistently achieve better performance compared to models trained on datasets balanced in the discrete space. The authors conducted extensive experiments, training over 65 different models and creating more than 20 subsets of the original datasets. This novel approach offers valuable insights into improving the balance and performance of face recognition models, with implications for addressing bias in AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years, researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view. However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space. We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of the original datasets.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V show potential in image forensics without specific fine-tuning. GPT-4V, using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting strategies, achieved competitive performance in detecting image splicing manipulations. The model demonstrated over 85% accuracy in zero-shot settings, with Chain-of-Thought prompting being the most balanced. It utilized real-world contextual knowledge to identify implausible composites beyond visual artifacts. While GPT-4V might not match specialized splicing detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic reasoning make it a flexible tool in image forensics. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics, specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies: Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on livestock applications.

Summary: <br />
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) integrates histology imaging with gene expression profiling. Existing methods lack cell-cell interaction modeling and struggle with memory constraints. STFlow, a flow matching generative model, addresses these limitations by considering cell-cell interaction and employing an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention. It outperforms current baselines on HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, achieving over 18% relative improvement. STFlow's approach to whole-slide gene expression prediction shows promise for enhancing ST technology's capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2506.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline across multiple metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore, we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original historical object.

Summary: 
Counterfeiting of images and videos is becoming a widespread issue on online platforms, leading to the dissemination of false information and potential misuse for criminal activities. Existing detection methods are insufficient in keeping up with evolving counterfeiting techniques, such as the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This study introduces an independent discriminant network based on a convolutional neural network to identify GAN-generated content. The proposed platform allows users to detect forged images and videos, aiding in the identification of counterfeit materials and hidden criminal evidence. By utilizing advanced technology to combat digital manipulation, this work aims to contribute to the field of forensic analysis and enhance efforts in combating the spread of misleading and fraudulent content online. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an image using various editing software which are readily available. This generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network has been created using a convolutional neural network based on InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge. Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet, leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a unified two-stage training framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance visual quality assessment. The framework includes a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. In the first stage, high-quality data is distilled from a teacher model to initialize reasoning capabilities. In the second stage, a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization is used to optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. The models derived from these stages, Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder, achieve state-of-the-art performance on quality score regression benchmarks, outperforming description-based models. Q-Ponder demonstrates higher accuracy and reasonableness in descriptions compared to its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, showcasing generalization potential across diverse tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: object segmentation, complex shapes, Talk2SAM, natural language guidance, semantic regions<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Talk2SAM, a novel approach that enhances object segmentation models by integrating textual guidance. Talk2SAM uses CLIP-based embeddings from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions and improve segmentation of complex shapes like wires and bicycles. By projecting these features into the DINO feature space, Talk2SAM provides additional prompts to the SAM-HQ model, improving its focus on target objects. The method allows for user-controllable segmentation and disambiguation within a single bounding box based on textual input. Evaluation on three benchmarks shows that Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving significant improvements in intersection over union and boundary intersection over union metrics. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating natural language guidance for precise object segmentation where traditional methods struggle. The source code for Talk2SAM is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ, enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K. Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\% boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods fail.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows.

<div> keywords: vision pretraining, object-level self-distillation, object-aware cropping, masked attention, transformer

Summary:
Object-level Self-DIStillation (ODIS) is a new approach for vision pretraining that focuses on individual objects rather than whole images. By using object-aware cropping and masked attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions and guides the transformer towards semantically meaningful content. This shift in granularity from scene-level to object-level sub-tasks improves visual representations at both the image and patch levels. The method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k when using masks at inference time, demonstrating the effectiveness of ODIS in transforming a noisy, scene-centric task into simpler object-centric tasks. The ODIS approach addresses the limitations of current vision pretraining methods by better capturing the complexity of real-world scenes and multiple objects within images.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity. We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation (ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

<br />
Summary: 
In a study involving 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers evaluated their ability to infer what others are looking at, a crucial skill for human-AI interaction. The VLMs performed poorly, as 94 out of 111 models were unable to surpass random guessing, unlike human participants who achieved near-perfect accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that the top-performing VLMs showed decreasing performance with higher task difficulty but consistent performance across different prompts and scene objects, indicating the use of heuristics rather than random guessing. While VLMs currently lack gaze inference capabilities necessary for natural interaction with humans, there is potential for improvement in the future. <div>
arXiv:2506.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65), and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

<div> benchmark, 3D spatial reasoning, dynamic scenes, audio-visual environments, spatial audio<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. It addresses the lack of exploration in this area by existing models and benchmarks, which focus mainly on static or 2D scenes. The benchmark consists of relationships involving static and moving objects, requiring fine-grained temporal grounding, 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. The proposed SAVVY reasoning pipeline comprises two stages: Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation and Dynamic Global Map Construction. By leveraging AV-LLMs and audio-visual methods, SAVVY tracks object trajectories and constructs a dynamic global map for 3D spatial reasoning. Empirical evaluation shows that SAVVY significantly improves the performance of existing AV-LLMs, setting a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in audio-visual environments. <div>

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360 dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training. We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly improves the generalization performance for unseen observations.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method, Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/JeongsooHa/DrG.git

<div> Keywords: Multi-Person Pose Estimation, Radio Frequency, One-Stage Model, Self-Supervised Learning, Raw signals

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE) using Radio Frequency (RF) signals. The proposed one-stage MPPE model is efficient and lightweight, achieving higher accuracy compared to existing methods. By subgrouping RF signals and utilizing a shared single-layer CNN with multi-head attention, the model outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method is introduced, which enhances performance when faced with new locations or obstacles. Experimental results show a significant improvement in MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in PCKh@0.5. The proposed SSL method further boosts performance gains, especially in scenarios with multiple individuals. The code and dataset for this study are publicly available on Github, allowing for further research and development in the field of RF-based MPPE. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency (RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas, contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in Social State Reasoning (SSR) and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP) tasks, according to the new SIV-Bench video benchmark. The benchmark consists of 2,792 video clips and 8,792 question-answer pairs collected from TikTok and YouTube, testing models' abilities to understand social interactions. While MLLMs excel in Social Scene Understanding (SSU), they struggle with SSR and SDP, particularly in Relation Inference (RI). The study highlights the importance of transcribed dialogue in aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. The findings provide valuable insights for the development of socially intelligent AI. The dataset and code are available for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR), and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and 8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset and code are available at https://kfq20.github.io/sivbench/.

Summary: 
A new approach for evaluating the robustness of vision-language models is proposed in this work. A generic surrogate model is trained to generate joint representations from both image and text inputs, enabling the generation of coordinated adversarial perturbations for both modalities. This coordinated attack strategy outperforms other multi-modal and single-modality attacks in compromising the robustness of state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on visual question answering and visual reasoning datasets, showcasing its impact on models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT. The results highlight the importance of considering inter-modal dependencies in evaluating model robustness and the potential vulnerabilities of current vision-language models to coordinated attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

<div> Keywords: video classification, robustness evaluation, multi-agent reinforcement learning, temporal coherence, perturbations<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach using multi-agent reinforcement learning for evaluating the robustness of video classification models. The challenge lies in minimizing perturbations while inducing misclassification due to the increased complexity and computational cost of video models. By incorporating spatial and temporal agents that consider temporal coherence, the approach effectively identifies sensitive regions in videos with visually imperceptible attacks. The method surpasses existing solutions in metrics like Lp and average queries, offering customizable distortion types for more relevant robustness evaluations. Extensive testing on popular video action recognition models on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets shows promising results, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging, specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Summary:<br />
The study explores the role of CLIP visual representations in vision-language models (VLMs). It suggests that while CLIP may have limitations, the language decoder in VLMs can compensate for weak visual features. By conducting self-attention ablations on three CLIP-based VLMs, the researchers found that the language backbone enriches the visual information provided by CLIP. Even when visual representations lack contextualization, the language decoder can make up for it and maintain performance. This dynamic division of labor highlights the potential for future VLM architectures to delegate more visual processing tasks to the language decoder. <div>
arXiv:2506.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.

<div> Keywords: Visual Language Models, Evaluation Methodology, Synthetic Images, Perception Failures, Fine-grained Analysis

Summary:
Visual Language Models (VLMs) have evolved to support various applications but evaluating them on specific benchmarks with real images and pre-defined questions can be costly and may not pinpoint the source of failures. To address this, a new evaluation methodology inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics is proposed. This approach involves generating synthetic images with controlled variation in specific attributes, allowing for systematic testing and detailed analysis of perception failures in VLMs. By focusing on fine-grained assessment, this methodology shifts the evaluation focus from aggregate scores to targeted evaluation of VLM capabilities. The code for this methodology is openly available on GitHub, facilitating further research in this area. This new approach provides a more comprehensive and interpretable evaluation of VLMs, enabling researchers to understand the specific limitations and strengths of these models in handling visual tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/byoeval/BYO-EVAL.

arXiv:2506.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However, troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with 0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20% accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally, ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g., weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications, affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A) super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B) reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation (high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Summary:
The article introduces RADAR, a novel approach for identifying changes made to authentic images using diffusion models. By combining features from different image modalities and incorporating an auxiliary contrastive loss, RADAR significantly improves accuracy and generalization to various diffusion models. A new benchmark, BBC-PAIR, is introduced to evaluate the method's performance on images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Results show that RADAR outperforms existing methods in detecting and localizing image edits by both seen and unseen diffusion models. The code, data, and models for RADAR will be publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

Summary:
- The paper introduces a new approach for 3D occupancy prediction using sparse query-based representations.
- Unlike existing methods relying on dense representations, the proposed framework summarizes the scene into a set of 3D queries that are propagated through time in a streaming fashion.
- These queries are decoded into semantic Gaussians at each timestep and guided by a denoising rendering objective to effectively capture scene geometry.
- The new method, named S2GO, outperforms prior art like GaussianWorld on nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, achieving a 1.5 IoU improvement with 5.9x faster inference. 
- S2GO demonstrates state-of-the-art efficiency and performance in 3D occupancy prediction for driving scenes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations. However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient, query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g., GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing 5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate future research in this field.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory. Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention. This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human cognition using neural network models.

Summary:
VR-INR is a novel video restoration method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) designed for high-resolution video enhancement. Unlike existing methods limited to specific upscaling factors, VR-INR can generalize to any unseen super-resolution scales during testing. It also exhibits zero-shot denoising capabilities on noisy input despite lacking noisy data in training. The approach utilizes a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework along with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding to adaptively decode high-resolution and noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired magnification. Experimental results demonstrate VR-INR's superior performance in maintaining sharpness, preserving details, and effectively denoising compared to state-of-the-art techniques. <div>
arXiv:2506.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Summary:
The article introduces MORSE-500, a video benchmark designed to assess multimodal reasoning abilities by incorporating temporal complexity and a broad spectrum of reasoning skills. The benchmark consists of 500 scripted video clips with questions across six reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using Python scripts and generative video models, allowing for precise control over difficulty levels. Unlike static benchmarks, MORSE-500 is built to evolve by enabling the creation of increasingly challenging instances. Initial experiments showed significant performance gaps in various reasoning categories, with abstract and planning tasks posing particular challenges for state-of-the-art systems. The dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness are released to support transparent and reproducible research in multimodal reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve: its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems -- including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent, reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

<div> interpretability, neural networks, concept-based, prototypical parts, user feedback

Summary:
Concept-based interpretable neural networks are popular for their intuitive explanations based on case-based reasoning. However, a limitation is concept inconsistency, where visual features are inappropriately mixed, leading to a lack of alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. The YoursProtoP strategy addresses this by allowing users to personalize prototypical parts according to their preferences. This interactive approach adapts and splits concepts to better match user understanding without compromising model accuracy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that YoursProtoP achieves concept consistency, enhancing user comprehension of model explanations. <div>

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy of the model.

Summary:
FRAME is introduced as a self-supervised video frame encoder designed for dense video understanding. It addresses the challenge of generating temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame in video prediction tasks. By predicting current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, FRAME achieves spatial precision and temporal coherence in its representations. It surpasses existing image encoders and self-supervised video models on dense prediction tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. Additionally, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, enabling support for language-driven tasks like video classification. The evaluation of FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets demonstrates its superior performance and versatility, while maintaining a compact architecture suitable for various downstream applications. <div>

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

<div> Keywords: Computer vision, 3D techniques, egocentric videos, dynamic segmentation, motion fusion

Summary: 
In the study of computer vision, the focus has traditionally been on 2D techniques, with 3D vision limited to specific applications. Recent advancements in 3D models like neural radiance fields have shown promise in enhancing outputs derived from independent 2D views by integrating them into 3D and eliminating noise. However, challenges arise when applying 3D techniques to dynamic phenomena such as segmenting moving objects. To address this limitation, the proposed approach involves Layered Motion Fusion, where motion segmentation predictions from a 2D model are fused into layered radiance fields. Test-time refinement is utilized to simplify the data complexity in long dynamic videos, enabling the model to concentrate on specific frames. This combination of motion fusion and refinement results in significantly improved segmentation predictions by the 3D model compared to the 2D baseline, showcasing the potential of 3D techniques to enhance the analysis of dynamic phenomena in a realistic setting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long, dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.

Summary:<br />
Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown significant progress in visual perception and reasoning but struggle with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, resulting in semantic hallucinations. This work identifies that transformer layers in LLMs with stronger attention on text regions are less prone to semantic hallucination. A training-free framework is proposed, including ZoomText for text region identification and Grounded Layer Correction for adaptive decoding guidance. The TextHalu-Bench benchmark assesses model hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate effective mitigation of semantic hallucation and strong performance in scene text spotting and understanding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.

The framework utilizes a Depth Watertight Mesh representation to address geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts, ensuring visual quality under extreme camera poses.

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries, leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality, physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video generation.

arXiv:2506.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

<div> Regularization Framework, Camera-based Occupancy Prediction, 3D Semantics, Scene Flow, VoxelSplat 

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper addresses the challenges in camera-based occupancy prediction, focusing on 3D semantics and scene flow. They introduce a regularization framework called VoxelSplat to enhance model performance. VoxelSplat improves semantics supervision by projecting 3D Gaussians onto the 2D camera view, providing additional supervision signals. It also learns scene flow by modeling the motion of Gaussians, enabling self-supervised learning of moving objects' scene flow using adjacent frame labels. The method can be seamlessly integrated into existing occupancy models without additional inference time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that VoxelSplat improves the accuracy of semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation. The project page and codes are available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

<div> Structured 3D generative model, PartCrafter, RGB image, multiple meshes, compositional generation architecture<br /><br />Summary: 
PartCrafter is a novel 3D generative model that can create multiple distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods, it doesn't require pre-segmented inputs and can denoise multiple 3D parts simultaneously to generate individual objects and complex scenes. The model is based on a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) and introduces a compositional latent space and hierarchical attention mechanism for structured generation. A new dataset with part-level annotations was curated to support part-level supervision. PartCrafter outperforms existing methods in generating decomposable 3D meshes, even those not directly visible in input images. This showcases the effectiveness of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis. The code and training data will be made publicly available.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified, compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts, ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation. To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images, demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Summary:<br />
Real-world image restoration faces challenges due to diverse degradations from various sources. Existing methods struggle to generalize to in-the-wild data. This paper introduces UniRes, a diffusion-based framework that handles complex degradations by combining specialized models. UniRes transfers knowledge from isolated restoration tasks to address mixed degradations in an end-to-end manner. The framework is flexible, allowing for extensions and adjusting fidelity-quality trade-offs. Evaluation on complex-degradation and single-degradation datasets demonstrates improved performance, particularly for images with complex degradations. The proposed method offers a promising solution for real-world image restoration tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines. Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing. Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent superiority across all degradation tasks.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone, subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR: 0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review (N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations. TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

<title>Token Transforming: A Unified and Training-Free Token Compression Framework for Vision Transformer Acceleration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05709</link>

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper, we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference acceleration.

<title>You Only Estimate Once: Unified, One-stage, Real-Time Category-level Articulated Object 6D Pose Estimation for Robotic Grasping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05719</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05719</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.

<title>Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05749</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures - weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual replay.

<title>Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ynklab/FILM

<title>Robust sensor fusion against on-vehicle sensor staleness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ) Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevenlin510/GazeNLQ.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in https://github.com/barry664/DeformCL

arXiv:2506.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance. The code is available at https://github.com/nayutayuki/FuseUNet.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor. We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community. Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second (MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise levels.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively. Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending, and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view), the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective (e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives, thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at https://github.com/lovelyqian/ObjectRelator.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field, existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics. Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments, and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT) device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32 images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional, uniform light.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

<title>Domain-RAG: Retrieval-Guided Compositional Image Generation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.

<title>Unleashing the Potential of Consistency Learning for Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation</title>

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However, most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders, i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder (SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at https://github.com/liyih/CSCL.

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%, which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper, we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is available at link https://github.com/earis/Offsetadjustment\_Background-location\_Decoder\_Mask2former.

<title>Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness</title>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static 3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

<title>Domain Adaptation in Agricultural Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Review from Shallow Models to Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research. This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA methods in agricultural image analysis.

arXiv:2506.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

<title>Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

<title>Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI). Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then, based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SSNI.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums). The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of 97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing and modelling codes are publicly available at https://github.com/diehlj/fast-iterated-sums.

<title>SDS-Net: Shallow-Deep Synergism-detection Network for infrared small target detection</title>

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed. Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/PhysiLearn/SDS-Net.

Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<title>WisWheat: A Three-Tiered Vision-Language Dataset for Wheat Management</title>

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

<title>VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

<title>Bidirectional Image-Event Guided Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE). Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information, and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

<title>CCLSTM: Coupled Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network for Occupancy Flow Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

<title>CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.

<title>A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios. Codes and dataset will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/H2Crop and www.glass.hku.hk

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and physical understanding.

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization versus 0-30% with standard configurations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists, `conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g., Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at: \href{https://vga.csail.mit.edu/}{vga.csail.mit.edu}

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable, high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a significant margin.

<title>Movie Facts and Fibs (MF$^2$): A Benchmark for Long Movie Understanding</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge, partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains 3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only 44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various physical and procedural domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/TerraFM .

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels (referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover, we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more realistic reconstructed images.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2) Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in training cost of less than 15%.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31% accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01) under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively, compared to a baseline U-Net model.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode different types of information and may thus draw information differently from the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data. This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model, capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data, which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances. The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or computational complexity.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search (NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS, the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS. Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of 28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset, a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page: https://pro-assist.github.io/

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate, therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that contains the information required for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates. This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations, presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations, elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital health tools across clinical domains.

<title>Gradient Similarity Surgery in Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery (SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the optimisation of the learning process.

<title>3DFlowAction: Learning Cross-Embodiment Manipulation from 3D Flow World Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06199</link>

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability. Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without hardware-specific training.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at [https://github.com/mjalali/embedding-comparison](github.com/mjalali/embedding-comparison).

Abstract: We propose a combined generative and contrastive neural architecture for learning latent representations of 3D volumetric shapes. The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel dynamic switching approach is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching approach also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance.

<title>Pseudo-labelling meets Label Smoothing for Noisy Partial Label Learning</title>

Abstract: We motivate weakly supervised learning as an effective learning paradigm for problems where curating perfectly annotated datasets is expensive and may require domain expertise such as fine-grained classification. We focus on Partial Label Learning (PLL), a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in the simulated fine-grained benchmarks. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic, fine-grained, crowd-sourced datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category, and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models. We make our entire framework, including the dataset, model weights, and training code.

Abstract: Regular screening and early discovery of uterine fibroid are crucial for preventing potential malignant transformations and ensuring timely, life-saving interventions. To this end, we collect and annotate the first ultrasound video dataset with 100 videos for uterine fibroid segmentation (UFUV). We also present Local-Global Reciprocal Network (LGRNet) to efficiently and effectively propagate the long-term temporal context which is crucial to help distinguish between uninformative noisy surrounding tissues and target lesion regions. Specifically, the Cyclic Neighborhood Propagation (CNP) is introduced to propagate the inter-frame local temporal context in a cyclic manner. Moreover, to aggregate global temporal context, we first condense each frame into a set of frame bottleneck queries and devise Hilbert Selective Scan (HilbertSS) to both efficiently path connect each frame and preserve the locality bias. A distribute layer is then utilized to disseminate back the global context for reciprocal refinement. Extensive experiments on UFUV and three public Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS) datasets demonstrate consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating the effectiveness and versatility of LGRNet. Code, checkpoints, and dataset are available at https://github.com/bio-mlhui/LGRNet

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds is a global challenge that can be alleviated by the adoption of automatic systems for clinical wound assessment from consumer-grade videos. While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D features of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods have not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos. Specifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of realistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset, we assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced neural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry approaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical measurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing this issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.

Abstract: Understanding the inner representation of a neural network helps users improve models. Concept-based methods have become a popular choice for explaining deep neural networks post-hoc because, unlike most other explainable AI techniques, they can be used to test high-level visual "concepts" that are not directly related to feature attributes. For instance, the concept of "stripes" is important to classify an image as a zebra. Concept-based explanation methods, however, require practitioners to guess and manually collect multiple candidate concept image sets, making the process labor-intensive and prone to overlooking important concepts. Addressing this limitation, in this paper, we frame concept image set creation as an image generation problem. However, since naively using a standard generative model does not result in meaningful concepts, we devise a reinforcement learning-based preference optimization (RLPO) algorithm that fine-tunes a vision-language generative model from approximate textual descriptions of concepts. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to efficiently and reliably articulate diverse concepts that are otherwise challenging to craft manually.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

Abstract: Diffusion models are cutting-edge generative models adept at producing diverse, high-quality images. Despite their effectiveness, these models often require significant computational resources owing to their numerous sequential denoising steps and the significant inference cost of each step. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically search for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is inherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion models to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion, a novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by concurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically, we partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each sequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null steps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step involves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation. Flexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment, substantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models reported speedup factors of $2.6\times$ and $1.5\times$ for the original LDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and the SOTA are $5.1\times$ and $2.0\times$. We also verified the performance of Flexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate that Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/Leopard.

Abstract: Out-of-Domain (OOD) generalization is the ability of a model trained on one or more domains to generalize to unseen domains. In the ImageNet era of computer vision, evaluation sets for measuring a model's OOD performance were designed to be strictly OOD with respect to style. However, the emergence of foundation models and expansive web-scale datasets has obfuscated this evaluation process, as datasets cover a broad range of domains and risk test domain contamination. In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION -- LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition -- that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization. Furthermore, through a systematic exploration of combining natural and rendition datasets in varying proportions, we identify optimal mixing ratios for model generalization across these domains. Our datasets and results re-enable meaningful assessment of OOD robustness at scale -- a crucial prerequisite for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm for visual representation learning, enabling models to acquire rich visual representations by predicting masked portions of images from their visible regions. While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.

Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.

Abstract: We study the problem of generating temporal object intrinsics -- temporally evolving sequences of object geometry, reflectance, and texture, such as a blooming rose -- from pre-trained 2D foundation models. Unlike conventional 3D modeling and animation techniques that require extensive manual effort and expertise, we introduce a method that generates such assets with signals distilled from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. To ensure the temporal consistency of object intrinsics, we propose Neural Templates for temporal-state-guided distillation, derived automatically from image features from self-supervised learning. Our method can generate high-quality temporal object intrinsics for several natural phenomena and enable the sampling and controllable rendering of these dynamic objects from any viewpoint, under any environmental lighting conditions, at any time of their lifespan.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are likelihood-based models for continuous inputs. They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow is straightforward to train end-to-end, and capable of directly modeling and generating pixels. We also propose three key techniques to improve sample quality: Gaussian noise augmentation during training, a post training denoising procedure, and an effective guidance method for both class-conditional and unconditional settings. Putting these together, TarFlow sets new state-of-the-art results on likelihood estimation for images, beating the previous best methods by a large margin, and generates samples with quality and diversity comparable to diffusion models, for the first time with a stand-alone NF model. We make our code available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tarflow.

Abstract: Automatically generating multiview illusions is a compelling challenge, where a single piece of visual content offers distinct interpretations from different viewing perspectives. Traditional methods, such as shadow art and wire art, create interesting 3D illusions but are limited to simple visual outputs (i.e., figure-ground or line drawing), restricting their artistic expressiveness and practical versatility. Recent diffusion-based illusion generation methods can generate more intricate designs but are confined to 2D images. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach for creating 3D multiview illusions based on user-provided text prompts or images. Our method leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize the textures and geometry of neural 3D representations through differentiable rendering. When viewed from multiple angles, this produces different interpretations. We develop several techniques to improve the quality of the generated 3D multiview illusions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and showcase illusion generation with diverse 3D forms.

Abstract: Recently released open-source pre-trained foundational image segmentation and object detection models (SAM2+GroundingDINO) allow for geometrically consistent segmentation of objects of interest in multi-view 2D images. Users can use text-based or click-based prompts to segment objects of interest without requiring labeled training datasets. Gaussian Splatting allows for the learning of the 3D representation of a scene's geometry and radiance based on 2D images. Combining Google Earth Studio, SAM2+GroundingDINO, 2D Gaussian Splatting, and our improvements in mask refinement based on morphological operations and contour simplification, we created a pipeline to extract the 3D mesh of any building based on its name, address, or geographic coordinates.

Abstract: Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Optimizers such as SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. However, access to gradient information is not always feasible in practice due to black-box APIs, hardware constraints, or non-differentiable systems, a challenge we refer to as the gradient bans. To bridge this gap, we introduce ZeroFlow, the first benchmark designed to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. ZeroFlow examines a suite of forward pass-based methods across various algorithms, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. Our results show that forward passes alone can be sufficient to mitigate forgetting. We uncover novel optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward pass-based methods in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands. Additionally, we propose new enhancements that further improve forgetting resistance using only forward passes. This work provides essential tools and insights to advance the development of forward-pass-based methods for continual learning.

Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating high-quality, diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, their ability to reproduce copyrighted styles, sensitive imagery, and harmful content raises significant ethical and legal concerns. Concept erasure offers a proactive alternative to external filtering by modifying T2I models to prevent the generation of undesired content. In this survey, we provide a structured overview of concept erasure, categorizing existing methods based on their optimization strategies and the architectural components they modify. We categorize concept erasure methods into fine-tuning for parameter updates, closed-form solutions for efficient edits, and inference-time interventions for content restriction without weight modification. Additionally, we explore adversarial attacks that bypass erasure techniques and discuss emerging defenses. To support further research, we consolidate key datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks for assessing erasure effectiveness and model robustness. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into the evolving landscape of concept erasure, its challenges, and future directions.

Abstract: Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.

Abstract: Knowing where a particular species can or cannot be found on Earth is crucial for ecological research and conservation efforts. By mapping the spatial ranges of all species, we would obtain deeper insights into how global biodiversity is affected by climate change and habitat loss. However, accurate range estimates are only available for a relatively small proportion of all known species. For the majority of the remaining species, we typically only have a small number of records denoting the spatial locations where they have previously been observed. We outline a new approach for few-shot species range estimation to address the challenge of accurately estimating the range of a species from limited data. During inference, our model takes a set of spatial locations as input, along with optional metadata such as text or an image, and outputs a species encoding that can be used to predict the range of a previously unseen species in a feedforward manner. We evaluate our approach on two challenging benchmarks, where we obtain state-of-the-art range estimation performance, in a fraction of the compute time, compared to recent alternative approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&amp;E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&amp;E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.

Abstract: The low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) problem aims to reconstruct a tensor from partial sample information, which has attracted significant interest in a wide range of practical applications such as image processing and computer vision. Among the various techniques employed for the LRTC problem, non-convex relaxation methods have been widely studied for their effectiveness in handling tensor singular values, which are crucial for accurate tensor recovery. While the minimax concave penalty (MCP) non-convex relaxation method has achieved promising results in tackling the LRTC problem and gained widely adopted, it exhibits a notable limitation: insufficient penalty on small singular values during the singular value handling process, resulting in inefficient tensor recovery. To address this issue and enhance recovery performance, a novel minimax $p$-th order concave penalty (MPCP) function is proposed. Based on this novel function, a tensor $p$-th order $\tau$ norm is proposed as a non-convex relaxation for tensor rank approximation, thereby establishing an MPCP-based LRTC model. Furthermore, theoretical convergence guarantees are rigorously established for the proposed method. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon at https://github.com/finyorko/armor.

Abstract: Understanding plant growth dynamics is essential for applications in agriculture and plant phenotyping. We present the Growth Modelling (GroMo) challenge, which is designed for two primary tasks: (1) plant age prediction and (2) leaf count estimation, both essential for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of four crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard. Each crop consists of multiple plants (p1, p2, ..., pn) captured over different days (d1, d2, ..., dm) and categorized into five levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5). Each plant is captured from 24 different angles with a 15-degree gap between images. Participants are required to perform both tasks for all four crops with these multiview images. We proposed a Multiview Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for the GroMo challenge and evaluated the crop-wise performance on GroMo25. MVVT reports an average MAE of 7.74 for age prediction and an MAE of 5.52 for leaf count. The GroMo Challenge aims to advance plant phenotyping research by encouraging innovative solutions for tracking and predicting plant growth. The GitHub repository is publicly available at https://github.com/mriglab/GroMo-Plant-Growth-Modeling-with-Multiview-Images.

However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions. Code will be available at https://github.com/Xian-Bei/TT-Occ.

Abstract: We address key limitations in existing datasets and models for task-oriented hand-object interaction video generation, a critical approach of generating video demonstrations for robotic imitation learning. Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset is publicly available to foster further advancements in the field, TASTE-Rob dataset and source code will be made publicly available on our website https://taste-rob.github.io.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of Computed Tomography (CT) scan examinations has created an urgent need for automated tools, such as organ segmentation, anomaly classification, and report generation, to assist radiologists with their growing workload. Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.

Abstract: Given that interpretability and steerability are crucial to AI safety, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a tool to enhance them in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in vision representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Notably, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.

Abstract: Cephalopods exhibit unique colour discrimination capabilities despite having one type of photoreceptor, relying instead on chromatic aberration induced by their ocular optics and pupil shapes to perceive spectral information. We took inspiration from this biological mechanism to design a spectral imaging system that combines a ball lens with an event-based camera. Our approach relies on a motorised system that shifts the focal position, mirroring the adaptive lens motion in cephalopods. This approach has enabled us to achieve wavelength-dependent focusing across the visible light and near-infrared spectrum, making the event a spectral sensor. We characterise chromatic aberration effects, using both event-based and conventional frame-based sensors, validating the effectiveness of bio-inspired spectral discrimination both in simulation and in a real setup as well as assessing the spectral discrimination performance. Our proposed approach provides a robust spectral sensing capability without conventional colour filters or computational demosaicing. This approach opens new pathways toward new spectral sensing systems inspired by nature's evolutionary solutions.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification and health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research hotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance when dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the case of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the practical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target detection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the latest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by introducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient multi-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional feature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively enhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small target detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone network solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the contrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex scenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection dataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the recall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\% or so compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly improved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by about 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and efficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application potential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing images.

While StreamPETR exhibits strong 3D bounding box detection performance as reflected by its high mean Average Precision our analysis identified velocity estimation as a substantial bottleneck when evaluated on the NuScenes dataset. To overcome this limitation, we propose a customized positional embedding strategy tailored to enhance temporal modeling capabilities. Experimental evaluations conducted on the NuScenes test set demonstrate that our improved approach achieves a state-of-the-art NDS of 70.86% using the ViT-L backbone, setting a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Abstract: Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs) are cornerstones for the link prediction task. However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.

Abstract: With the rapid modernization of urban transportation, accurately detecting changes such as road and bridge construction, renovation, and demolition is crucial for urban planning and traffic management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic changes in complex traffic scenes, largely due to the lack of high-quality annotated change detection (CD) datasets. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images. RB-SCD spans diverse geographic areas and includes a wide variety of road and bridge types across over ten cities in multiple countries. It covers 11 distinct categories of semantic changes, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Based on this challenging dataset, we propose a novel framework called the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). For the first time, MFDCD integrates multimodal feature characteristics in the frequency domain. It comprises two key components: the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) and the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF). DFC couples hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, enhancing the perception of fine-grained and cross-temporal structural changes. TFF transforms textual features extracted by the CLIP model into the frequency domain via Fourier transform and applies graph-based filtering to extract salient frequency responses. These are then fused with visual features to enable effective multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments show that MFDCD achieves strong performance on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks. The RB-SCD dataset, with its rich and diverse annotations, serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in road and bridge change detection under complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two face images corresponding to two identities to produce a composite that successfully matches both the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference images. Previous RF demorphing methods are overly constrained, as they rely on assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the morphing technique used (e.g., landmark-based) and face image style (e.g., passport photos). In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach, referred to as diffDeMorph, that effectively disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our method.

Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.

Abstract: Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.

Abstract: The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to adapt source pre-trained models to continually changing, unseen target domains. While existing CTTA methods assume structured domain changes with uniform durations, real-world environments often exhibit dynamic patterns where domains recur with varying frequencies and durations. Current approaches, which adapt the same parameters across different domains, struggle in such dynamic conditions-they face convergence issues with brief domain exposures, risk forgetting previously learned knowledge, or misapplying it to irrelevant domains. To remedy this, we propose DPCore, a method designed for robust performance across diverse domain change patterns while ensuring computational efficiency. DPCore integrates three key components: Visual Prompt Adaptation for efficient domain alignment, a Prompt Coreset for knowledge preservation, and a Dynamic Update mechanism that intelligently adjusts existing prompts for similar domains while creating new ones for substantially different domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DPCore consistently outperforms various CTTA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both structured and dynamic settings while reducing trainable parameters by 99% and computation time by 64% compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.

Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.

Abstract: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MedXpertQA

Abstract: As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities, socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.

Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.

Abstract: Generative retrieval is an emerging approach in information retrieval that generates identifiers (IDs) of target data based on a query, providing an efficient alternative to traditional embedding-based retrieval methods. However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that accelerates the discovery of actionable relationships in high-dimensional temporal data by integrating machine learning (ML), explainable AI (XAI), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data quality and streamline workflows. Traditional methods often fail to recognize complex temporal relationships, leading to noisy, redundant, or biased datasets. Our approach combines ML-driven pruning to identify and mitigate low-quality samples, XAI-based interpretability to validate critical feature interactions, and NLP for future contextual validation, reducing the time required to uncover actionable insights by 40-60%. Evaluated on real-world agricultural and synthetic datasets, the framework significantly improves performance metrics (e.g., MSE, R2, MAE) and computational efficiency, with hardware-agnostic scalability across diverse platforms. While long-term real-world impacts (e.g., cost savings, sustainability gains) are pending, this methodology provides an immediate pathway to accelerate data-centric AI in dynamic domains like agriculture and energy, enabling faster iteration cycles for domain experts.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&amp;E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new task of reading recognition to determine when a user is reading, essential for contextual AI in smart glasses. A large-scale dataset, Reading in the Wild, is presented, containing 100 hours of diverse reading and non-reading videos. Three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) are identified for solving the task, with a transformer model performing efficiently using these modalities individually or combined. The relevance and complementarity of these modalities to the task are demonstrated, along with strategies for encoding each modality effectively. The dataset proves useful for classifying types of reading in varied scenarios, contributing to understanding reading behavior in diverse and realistic settings. This work extends current understanding of reading from constrained environments to larger scale scenarios.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world, including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset, containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality. Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism.

Summary:<br /><br />Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by tackling vision-language tasks with diverse requirements. This study introduces a systematic post-training framework for MLLMs using RLVR, focusing on optimizing dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. The framework includes a curated dataset of verifiable vision-language problems and a multi-domain RLVR setup with different rewards. A data mixture strategy is proposed to predict the fine-tuning outcome and optimize the best mixture for training. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the MLLM's general reasoning capabilities. The best mixture strategy boosts the accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by 5.24% compared to uniform data mixture and by 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Our GRPO algorithm uses reward signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

Abstract: Making neural visual generative models controllable by logical reasoning systems is promising for improving faithfulness, transparency, and generalizability. We propose the Abductive visual Generation (AbdGen) approach to build such logic-integrated models. A vector-quantized symbol grounding mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore, we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly.

It employs a two-stage online filter to predict and skip matrix multiplications in the attention map, significantly accelerating diverse models such as language, image, and video generation.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) as a novel framework for adaptive adversarial training in deep neural networks. DES adjusts the perturbation budget on a per-instance and per-iteration basis by considering the distance to the decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that DES improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods. The theoretical analysis provided in the paper offers insights into the stability and convergence of the proposed scheduling policy. DES represents a significant advancement in instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods, offering a more effective and dynamic approach to defending against adversarial attacks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy, and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Summary: 
Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP) introduces a new framework that combines multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP consists of two stages: reasoning-driven localization and segmentation refinement, utilizing multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to enhance visual grounding. The framework integrates textual and visual cues to generate precise segmentation masks through a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM). By explicitly modeling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP enables MLLMs to reason about objects and generate structured visual representations. Experimental results show that RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg and 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings. RSVP is validated as an effective framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$, including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

<div> Keywords: 3D human generation, generative AI, text prompts, photorealistic dataset, transformer-based architecture

Summary:
In the field of 3D human generation, challenges persist in achieving fine detail, realistic rendering of hands and faces, and control over appearance from text prompts. Existing methods struggle with diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data, inhibiting the development of foundational 3D human models. To address these issues, a weakly supervised pipeline is proposed. Firstly, a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes is generated using an image diffusion model. Secondly, an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds is introduced utilizing a transformer-based architecture. Finally, a point-cloud diffusion model conditioned on text prompts is trained. This pipeline achieves significant speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to current approaches, improving text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation, and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification.

<div> Keywords: world modeling, procedural planning, AI benchmark, video-based, action recognition

Summary:
The paper introduces a new benchmark called WorldPrediction that evaluates the world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of AI agents. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on low-level tasks, WorldPrediction emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. The benchmark tasks include distinguishing the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from distractors based on initial and final world states. Visual observations are used to represent states and actions, with "action equivalents" provided to prevent models from exploiting background cues. Grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, the benchmark ensures reliability and robustness of evaluation. Human filtering and validation show that current AI models struggle to achieve high accuracy on WorldPrediction tasks compared to humans. WorldPrediction aims to push the frontier of AI research by testing world modeling and procedural planning capabilities in diverse environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models, especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning, WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called PLUCC for detecting the puck in ice hockey broadcast videos. PLUCC leverages contextual cues derived from player behavior, such as body orientation and gaze direction, to improve detection accuracy. It comprises three main components: a contextual encoder, a feature pyramid encoder, and a gating decoder with a channel gating mechanism. In addition to traditional evaluation metrics like average precision, a new metric called Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE) is proposed to account for perspective bias in rink space evaluation. Experimental results on the PuckDataset show that PLUCC outperforms existing methods, with a 12.2% improvement in average precision and a 25% improvement in RSLE average precision. The study highlights the importance of contextual understanding in enhancing puck detection performance and its potential applications in automated sports analysis. <div>
arXiv:2506.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of 12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

<div> video transformer architectures, Sign Language Recognition, BdSL dataset, data augmentation techniques, model performance

Summary:
The study focuses on Sign Language Recognition (SLR) using state-of-the-art video transformer architectures on the Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) dataset. Fine-tuning models such as VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer on BdSLW60 and BdSLW401 datasets showed significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance model robustness. Evaluation through cross-validation and signer-independent testing revealed the superiority of video transformer models in recognizing BdSL signs. Factors like dataset size, video quality, and model architecture influenced performance, with the VideoMAE variant achieving highest accuracies. The results demonstrate the potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition using advanced deep learning techniques. <div>
arXiv:2506.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in 9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401 sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets, including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set, while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics) achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60 dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

<div> fMRI, deep neural networks, activation maximization, visual cortex, brain responses
Summary: 
An approach using activation maximization on deep neural network-based encoding models of the human brain is presented in this study. By adapting activations from a pretrained Inception V3 network and using linear regression to predict fMRI responses, a full image-computable model of brain responses is created. Utilizing activation maximization, images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels are generated, showing visual characteristics corresponding to known selectivity. This method is extended to whole regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain and tested with human participants in an fMRI study, demonstrating reliable driving of activity in targeted regions. The results showcase the efficacy of activation maximization applied to DNN-based encoding models, offering flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system. <div>
arXiv:2506.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models, our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image protection, perturbation, misinformation, editing

Summary:
Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can be used for image generation but also misused for spreading misinformation and plagiarizing copyrighted materials. Current image protection methods use perturbations to obstruct diffusion-based editing, aiming to create noisy and unrelated images when edited. However, experiments show that these methods do not completely achieve this goal. In many cases, protected images can still be edited to generate desirable outputs that closely match the guidance prompt. Adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with text prompts during the generation process, resulting in unintended consequences such as better edits. Therefore, perturbation-based methods may not offer sufficient protection against diffusion-based editing for robust image protection. <div>

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

Summary:
This article introduces the concept of filter normalization in deep learning to address the absence of normalization in convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks. By applying classical filtering principles and incorporating learnable scaling and shifting similar to batch normalization, the proposed method ensures that filters are atmosphere-equivariant, leading to improved outcomes in the presence of atmospheric transfer. The study demonstrates significant improvements on intensity variation benchmarks for both artificial and natural images, with the ResNet34 model even surpassing CLIP by a substantial margin. The analysis highlights that unnormalized filters can degrade performance, while filter normalization promotes diversity, improves robustness, and enhances generalization in deep learning models dependent on convolution. <div>
arXiv:2506.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.

<div> Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), Image Generation, Next-Scale Prediction, Masked Prediction, Image Quality <br />
Summary: <br />
Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR) is developed as a new image generation algorithm that improves on Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR). By reformulating next-scale prediction and utilizing masked prediction, HMAR generates high-quality images quickly with a controllable multi-step procedure. HMAR achieves performance on par with VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines on ImageNet benchmarks. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels enable HMAR to train and infer over 2.5x and 1.75x faster than VAR, with a lower memory footprint. Additionally, HMAR offers greater flexibility, allowing for changes in the sampling schedule without the need for retraining, and enabling zero-shot application to image editing tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Summary:
This paper explores challenges in using egocentric devices for photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range. The study highlights the importance of utilizing visual-inertial bundle adjustment for precise calibration of rolling shutter RGB cameras. By incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting, the sensor characteristics and dynamic ranges can be effectively addressed. Evaluation using the Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices demonstrates a consistent visual enhancement with a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio. The findings showcase the benefits of accurate camera calibration and image formation modeling for improved photoreal reconstruction in various lighting conditions. <div>
arXiv:2506.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model.

<div> Keywords: face recognition, pose invariance, defrontalization, facial feature extraction, training dataset

Summary:
In this work, a new method called face defrontalization is proposed to enhance pose-invariant face recognition by training a model on frontal-profile pairs dataset. This method does not introduce any time overhead during inference and involves training a face defrontalization FFWM model and a ResNet-50 facial feature extraction model. The approach was evaluated on various open-access datasets, showing improved results compared to models without defrontalization. The proposed method outperforms existing face frontalization methods on larger datasets, highlighting potential overfitting issues of current approaches on smaller datasets. However, for extreme poses in the Multi-PIE dataset, the proposed method did not show clear superiority. This suggests the need for further research to address challenges in achieving pose invariance in face recognition systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance, current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses (75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR, 3D object detection, FALO, ConvDotMix, resource-constrained devices 

Summary: 
FALO is a hardware-friendly approach to LiDAR 3D object detection, offering high accuracy and fast inference speed. It arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence for efficient processing. The ConvDotMix blocks in FALO utilize large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers to enhance spatial and embedding feature interaction. Implicit grouping balances tensor dimensions for efficient inference and accounts for the increasing receptive field. FALO is designed for deployment on compact, embedded devices and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo. It outperforms the latest SOTA methods on mobile GPUs and NPUs by a speedup factor of 1.6 to 9.8. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features. Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit (NPU).

<div> Keywords: deepfake detection, language guidance, vision encoder, statistical artifacts, data uncertainty learning

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose a new deepfake detection technique called AuthGuard that enhances generalization by incorporating language guidance for human-like commonsense reasoning. By training an expert deepfake vision encoder using image-text contrastive learning with few-shot prompting, the proposed framework is able to extract both language-describable deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts. By integrating data uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, noise in image-text supervision is mitigated, resulting in improved robustness. AuthGuard achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming existing techniques on the DFDC and DF40 datasets. The framework also enhances deepfake reasoning, as demonstrated by a significant improvement in performance on the DDVQA dataset. Overall, AuthGuard provides a comprehensive and effective solution for detecting deepfake content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable, commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework, AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15% on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on the DDVQA dataset.

<div> propose, pruning, deep learning, neural networks, efficiency
Summary:
The article introduces a new method for pruning structures in deep learning models to improve computational efficiency. Unlike existing techniques that focus on removing either neurons or layers, the proposed method can simultaneously prune different structures within a model. By selecting the subnetwork with the highest representation similarity to its parent using the Centered Kernel Alignment metric, the method creates highly sparse models that maintain predictive performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach outperforms current layer and filter pruning techniques, achieving significant reduction in Floating Point Operations with minimal loss of accuracy. Notably, the method shows improvements on popular architectures like ResNet56 and ResNet110, with up to 95.82% FLOPs reduction. Moreover, the pruned models exhibit robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples, and contribute to GreenAI by reducing carbon emissions up to 83.31%. This work marks a significant advancement in model pruning techniques. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks. However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore, simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once, we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent (the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82% FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI, reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a new chapter in pruning.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs) as a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution tasks, directly enhancing image frequency components. LSKs are designed as rank-one matrices, reducing parameters and computational requirements by over 60%. Decomposing LSKs into orthogonal one-dimensional kernels leads to improved model performance.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

<div> Keywords: slow-thinking language models, multi-modal large language models, visual grounding, reinforcement learning, reasoning objective

Summary: 
Recent advancements in slow-thinking language models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks by emulating reflective human-like cognition. However, extending these abilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) poses challenges due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading the underlying reasoner LLMs. The proposed solution, RACRO, decouples perception from reasoning by optimizing captioning behavior through reasoning-guided reinforcement learning. This approach enhances visual grounding and generates reasoning-optimized representations. By closing the perception-reasoning loop, RACRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal math and science benchmarks while allowing for superior scalability and easy adaptation to advanced reasoning LLMs without costly re-alignment. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this, we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal re-alignment.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Summary:<br />
- Follow-Your-Creation is a new 4D video creation framework that can generate and edit 4D content from a single monocular video input.
- It leverages a video inpainting model as a generative prior, making 4D video creation a video inpainting task to fill in missing content due to camera trajectory changes or user edits.
- The model is trained on composite masked inpainting video data generated from depth-based point cloud rendering and editing masks, allowing for diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios.

- A temporal packaging module is introduced during inference to improve generation quality and support prompt-based content editing, outperforming existing methods in quality and versatility. <div>
arXiv:2506.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance, enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quality and versatility.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt. While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance, making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications. Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

arXiv:2506.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research. By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies, this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

<div> Evaluating multimodal AI models on spatial reasoning tasks<br />
Spatial cognition, visual simulations, multimodal large language models, STARE benchmark, geometric transformations<br /><br />Summary:<br />Spatial cognition plays a crucial role in human intelligence, allowing for problem-solving through visual simulations rather than just verbal reasoning. The STARE benchmark assesses multimodal large language models on tasks that require multi-step visual simulations, covering various spatial reasoning challenges. While models perform well on simpler 2D transformations, they struggle with more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles. Humans achieve high accuracy on these tasks but speed up significantly with intermediate visual simulations. Models show inconsistent gains from visual simulations, highlighting a need for improved leveraging of visual information. The study sheds light on the limitations of current AI benchmarks that primarily focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting the complexities of non-verbal spatial reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning, neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up (down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0 Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage intermediate visual information.

<div> Keywords: generative models, image super-resolution, text-aware attention, joint segmentation decoders, high-quality images<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based image super-resolution framework called TADiSR that addresses fidelity issues, particularly with textual structures. By integrating text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders, TADiSR enhances the structural fidelity of text regions in degraded real-world images. The proposed pipeline synthesizes high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks, effectively combining foreground text regions with detailed background content. Through extensive experiments, TADiSR demonstrates significant improvements in text legibility in super-resolved images and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics. The approach also shows strong generalization to real-world scenarios. The code for TADiSR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR, which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks, combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to real-world scenarios. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/mingcv/TADiSR}{here}.

Summary:
FPSAttention introduces a training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, focusing on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. The approach features a unified 3D tile-wise granularity supporting quantization and sparsity simultaneously, a denoising step-aware strategy adapting to the noise schedule, and a hardware-friendly kernel leveraging FlashAttention for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution, without sacrificing generation quality.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

<div> representation learning, neural networks, feature extraction, object segmentation, Galois algebra theory

Summary:
This article introduces a new method for representation learning without supervision, inspired by human development. The traditional assumption of disentangled feature axes is challenged, as it fails to consider conditional independence. The authors propose a novel approach based on group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. However, the initial method was limited to low-resolution images with no background. To address this, the authors present a modified technique combining feature extraction and object segmentation. This allows for the application of group decomposition theory to realistic scenarios, improving the understanding of human object recognition. By replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features based on transformations, the proposed model shows promise in acquiring meaningful representations in real-world environments. <div>
arXiv:2506.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background. We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.

<div> Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification, Mixture of LoRA Experts, concept guidance, multi-level feature preservation, geometry-aware concept discrimination loss<br />
Summary:<br />
The proposed Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification framework addresses challenges in low-data settings by balancing parameters and aligning representation patterns. Leveraging Mixture of LoRA Experts allows for efficient parameter adaptation. Cross-module concept guidance ensures alignment between feature representations and concept activation patterns. A multi-level feature preservation strategy enriches representations by fusing spatial and semantic cues. A geometry-aware concept discrimination loss encourages orthogonal concepts for clearer decision boundaries. Experimental results on six benchmarks show significant performance improvement, with 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification. The approach combines concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve higher accuracy and model interpretability, paving the way for more transparent visual recognition systems.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts, encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more transparent visual recognition systems.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel data generation framework called Gen-n-Val, which combines Layer Diffusion (LD), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to produce high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: the LD prompt agent and the data validation agent. The LD prompt agent optimizes prompts for LD to generate single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds, while the data validation agent filters out low-quality synthetic images. The system prompts are refined through TextGrad, and image harmonization is used to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to existing methods, Gen-n-Val reduces invalid synthetic data and improves performance on COCO instance segmentation and object detection benchmarks. It shows significant improvements over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks as well. <div>

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Summary: 
MARS is a new method introduced to accurately reconstruct radio maps from sparse measurements, crucial for applications in smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. Traditional techniques like interpolation and inpainting lack environmental awareness, while deep learning approaches often rely on detailed scene data and struggle with generalization. MARS, however, combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance global and local feature extraction, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results across various scenes and antenna locations demonstrate that MARS outperforms baseline models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) while maintaining low computational cost. This highlights the practical potential of MARS in effectively and efficiently reconstructing radio maps.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Summary: 
The article introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing the limitations of current approaches. It covers all safe/unsafe image-text combinations to enhance training and evaluation, aiming to prevent jailbreak attacks and improve safety in unseen configurations. SafeLLaVA, a new VLM model, incorporates a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head to encode harmful visual cues and offer interpretable harmfulness classification. The model, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance on multiple benchmarks. The HoliSafe benchmark also identifies vulnerabilities in existing VLM models, highlighting the importance of robust and interpretable safety measures in VLMs. These advancements aim to drive further research in enhancing VLM safety and expanding multimodal alignment possibilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Summary:
Linearly decodable features representative of ImageNet classes are found in the residual stream of the LlaVA-Next model, showcasing the multimodal capabilities of models trained on embeddings of visual inputs. Targeted edits on the model output demonstrate the causal nature of these features. Training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders results in a dictionary of highly interpretable text and image features, enhancing the diversity of studied linear features. Despite initial disjoint representations across modalities, model representations become more shared in deeper layers, suggesting convergence towards a unified representation space. <div>

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

<div> Keywords: Pretrained VLMs, Few-shot adaptation, OOD generalization, Finetuning, Augmentation techniques

Summary: 
Finetuning with proper hyperparameters outperforms prompt tuning and linear probing for VLM adaptation. Visual encoder-only finetuning is more efficient and accurate than contrastive finetuning both visual and textual encoders. Finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder balances ID and OOD accuracy best. Retrieval augmentation boosts OOD accuracy, while adversarial perturbation enhances robustness during finetuning. Naively combining both techniques sacrifices overall ID and OOD accuracy. To address this, SRAPF, a two-stage process of partial finetuning and adversarial partial finetuning, is proposed. SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID) task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation, aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation, and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning. Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

arXiv:2506.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial display panel datasets, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline model, achieving an average IoU increase of 0.22 and a 14% improvement in recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60% auto-labeling coverage. Experimental results show that models trained on our auto-labeled data match the performance of those trained on human-labeled data, offering a practical solution for reducing manual annotation efforts in industrial inspection systems.

<div> label-aligned transfer, object detection, dataset integration, class semantics, bounding box annotations 

Summary:
Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT) is introduced as a framework that aims to improve generalization in object detection by integrating multiple datasets with different label taxonomies and annotation inconsistencies. LAT first trains dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations using a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) to address spatial inconsistencies. A Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module further refines region features by injecting class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals. This approach allows for many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, aligning both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies. LAT does not rely on shared label spaces or manual annotations, preserving dataset-specific annotation granularity while achieving improved detection performance in the target domain. Across various benchmarks, LAT consistently outperforms semi-supervised baselines, demonstrating gains of up to +4.8AP.

arXiv:2506.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT), a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector. LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations. Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over semi-supervised baselines.

<title>SRD: Reinforcement-Learned Semantic Perturbation for Backdoor Defense in VLMs</title>

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, backdoor attacks, reinforcement learning, semantic fidelity, multimodal generative models <br />
Summary:<br />
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where attackers can manipulate the model to generate malicious captions. This is problematic due to the stealthiness and cross-modal nature of the attacks. The proposed solution, Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), employs a reinforcement learning framework to counter these attacks without prior knowledge of triggers. By disrupting the activation of malicious pathways through perturbations, SRD aims to reduce attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs with minimal performance drop. Using a semantic fidelity score as a reward signal, SRD guides the agent to generate robust yet faithful captions, addressing abnormal attention concentration and semantic incoherence in the generated captions. SRD offers an interpretable defense against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1) abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g., occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning. Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal large language models, data selection, cognitive samples, multi-modal reasoning, Reasoning Activation Potential<br />
Summary:<br />
In this study, the focus is on improving multi-modal reasoning in large language models using smaller high-value datasets. The authors introduce a novel data selection paradigm called Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP) that identifies cognitive samples triggering genuine multi-modal reasoning. RAP includes two estimators, Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), to select samples based on their potential to stimulate reasoning and discard language priors. Additionally, a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) replaces trivial instances with more challenging ones to ensure robust multi-modal reasoning. Experimental results on six datasets show that RAP achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, reducing computational costs by over 43%. The code for RAP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

<div> photometric relation, monocular depth learning, SSIM, unsupervised, optimization

Summary:
This work introduces a new form of the SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, focusing on improving training performance. The proposed SSIM form incorporates luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components through addition rather than multiplication, resulting in smoother gradients during training. Extensive experiments are conducted to optimize the parameters of the new SSIM function, showing significant performance improvements compared to the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset. By utilizing the optimized SSIM loss function within the MonoDepth framework, this approach enhances the accuracy of unsupervised depth estimation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

<div> Keywords: Visual Place Recognition, Perspective-to-Equirectangular formulation, Hyperbolic space, Hierarchical feature aggregation, Coarse-to-fine search strategy

Summary: 
HypeVPR is a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space designed for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using the perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation. The framework leverages the hierarchical structures present in visual environments captured by panoramic views. It employs hyperbolic space to represent feature relationships hierarchically and preserve distance properties within the feature space. HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, it adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy to balance speed and accuracy in matching descriptors from different image types. This approach allows HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods and achieve up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse benchmark datasets.

arXiv:2506.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

<br />
Summary: Object-X is a versatile framework for multi-modal object representation in 3D space. It encodes rich object embeddings from images, point clouds, and text, and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. By grounding modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding, Object-X enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction and supports various tasks such as scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and achieves competitive performance in scene alignment and localization. Importantly, Object-X significantly reduces storage requirements compared to traditional approaches, making it a scalable and practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation. <div>
arXiv:2506.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings.

arXiv:2506.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g., homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e., the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation. SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation.

arXiv:2506.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented 97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3) Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern recognition.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range. However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR), addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic lights.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Such systems have matured significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Abstract: We present a new viewpoint on a reconstructing multidimensional geological fields from sparse observations. Drawing inspiration from deterministic image inpainting techniques, we model a partially observed spatial field as a multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a global low-rank structure. Our approach combines ideas from tensor completion and geostatistics, providing a robust optimization framework. Experiments on synthetic geological fields demonstrate that used tensor completion method significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy over ordinary kriging for various percent of observed data.

<title>Invisible Backdoor Triggers in Image Editing Model via Deep Watermarking</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions, without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess, the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable.

<title>From Objects to Anywhere: A Holistic Benchmark for Multi-level Visual Grounding in 3D Scenes</title>

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

<title>Generating Synthetic Stereo Datasets using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Expert Knowledge Transfer</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models. Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just individual animal re-identification.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists' overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists' evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<title>Robustness as Architecture: Designing IQA Models to Withstand Adversarial Perturbations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04951</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust. Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses -- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through data to engineering it through design.

<title>APVR: Hour-Level Long Video Understanding with Adaptive Pivot Visual Information Retrieval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR (Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.

<title>FEAT: Full-Dimensional Efficient Attention Transformer for Medical Video Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations, including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only 23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at https://github.com/Yaziwel/FEAT.

<title>Bringing SAM to new heights: Leveraging elevation data for tree crown segmentation from drone imagery</title>

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes, making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories (e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds, enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding capabilities.

<title>Multi-scale Image Super Resolution with a Single Auto-Regressive Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However, due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model (300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

<title>Beyond Cropped Regions: New Benchmark and Corresponding Baseline for Chinese Scene Text Retrieval in Diverse Layouts</title>

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene text retrieval.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth features from some well-annotated datasets \cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem \cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors \cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios, particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs. Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness.

<title>Physical Annotation for Automated Optical Inspection: A Concept for In-Situ, Pointer-Based Trainingdata Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05026</link>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

<title>FlowDirector: Training-Free Flow Steering for Precise Text-to-Video Editing</title>

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions, including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage community-driven solutions.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22], which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

<title>Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics</title>

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies. Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions: for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile infrastructural precision with lived experience.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

<title>DIMCIM: A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Default-mode Diversity and Generalization in Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05108</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05108</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity ("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters. DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets. Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore, we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli. CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7 hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Through-the-Wall-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Without-Using-Neural-Networks.

<title>Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment, far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

<title>Grounding Beyond Detection: Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Embodied 3D Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05199</link>

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions. Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

<title>OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization, yet their ability to transfer knowledge to specialized domains such as garment generation remains underexplored. We introduce VLG, a vision-language-garment model that synthesizes garments from textual descriptions and visual imagery. Our experiments assess VLG's zero-shot generalization, investigating its ability to transfer web-scale reasoning to unseen garment styles and prompts. Preliminary results indicate promising transfer capabilities, highlighting the potential for multimodal foundation models to adapt effectively to specialized domains like fashion design.

<title>DSG-World: Learning a 3D Gaussian World Model from Dual State Videos</title>

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand, explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

<title>MonkeyOCR: Document Parsing with a Structure-Recognition-Relation Triplet Paradigm</title>

arXiv:2506.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g., large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?" (recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach, we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL (72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

<title>SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

<title>Spatiotemporal Contrastive Learning for Cross-View Video Localization in Unstructured Off-road Terrains</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05250</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework, using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models. Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over 12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a different robot platform.

<title>LeanPO: Lean Preference Optimization for Likelihood Alignment in Video-LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta (y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.

<title>Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD) on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two, or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets. One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide images are the key to generalisation.

<title>From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274</link>

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each  pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

<title>Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically, given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus meeting the needs of the medical field.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/alitok.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2 by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs, including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision, localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations, including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual understanding.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data, however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable, real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization, directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity, leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state, and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

<title>Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs</title>

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

<title>Revisiting Depth Representations for Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis. This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map, our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.

<title>MINT-CoT: Enabling Interleaved Visual Tokens in Mathematical Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT. However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset, containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline. We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

<title>Defurnishing with X-Ray Vision: Joint Removal of Furniture from Panoramas and Mesh</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images. To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

<title>Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

<title>SparseMM: Head Sparsity Emerges from Visual Concept Responses in MLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at https://github.com/CR400AF-A/SparseMM.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g., class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows, enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs. We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x, (2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9 compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

<title>RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO), indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters, which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made publicly available.

<title>Learning Smooth State-Dependent Traversability from Dense Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications. Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while opening up several future directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/info-ucr/PEFTLeak.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.

<title>Handle-based Mesh Deformation Guided By Vision Language Model</title>

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples. StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost. Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at https://github.com/LAION-AI/scaling-laws-for-comparison.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases, we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

<title>VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623</link>

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels: the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level, which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks: offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6 directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features. Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly under-resourced ones.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation is observed.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability. This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis, developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs) through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA) system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping, and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and conducting comprehensive system validation.

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts. An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/mariomlz99/MineInsight.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks, while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution. Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable, image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&amp;E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&amp;E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&amp;E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

<title>Aligning Latent Spaces with Flow Priors</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling, existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.

Abstract: Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the problem of novel view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but also comes with limitations in their applicability. This work introduces ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than comparable methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small Neural 3D Mesh Renderer dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/bronemos/view-fusion.

Abstract: Visual commonsense plays a vital role in understanding and reasoning about the visual world. While commonsense knowledge bases like ConceptNet provide structured collections of general facts, they lack visually grounded representations. Scene graph datasets like Visual Genome, though rich in object-level descriptions, primarily focus on directly observable information and lack systematic categorization of commonsense knowledge. We present Visual Commonsense Dataset (VCD), a large-scale dataset containing over 100,000 images and 14 million object-commonsense pairs that bridges this gap. VCD introduces a novel three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense, integrating both Seen (directly observable) and Unseen (inferrable) commonsense across Property, Action, and Space aspects. Each commonsense is represented as a triple where the head entity is grounded to object bounding boxes in images, enabling scene-dependent and object-specific visual commonsense representation. To demonstrate VCD's utility, we develop VCM, a generative model that combines a vision-language model with instruction tuning to discover diverse visual commonsense from images. Extensive evaluations demonstrate both the high quality of VCD and its value as a resource for advancing visually grounded commonsense understanding and reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released on https://github.com/NUSTM/VCD.

Abstract: Large repositories of image-caption pairs are essential for the development of vision-language models. However, these datasets are often extracted from noisy data scraped from the web, and contain many mislabeled instances. In order to improve the reliability of downstream models, it is important to identify and filter images with incorrect captions. However, beyond filtering based on image-caption embedding similarity, no prior works have proposed other methods to filter noisy multimodal data, or concretely assessed the impact of noisy captioning data on downstream training. In this work, we propose, theoretically justify, and empirically validate LEMoN, a method to identify label errors in image-caption datasets. Our method leverages the multimodal neighborhood of image-caption pairs in the latent space of contrastively pretrained multimodal models to automatically identify label errors. Through empirical evaluations across eight datasets and twelve baselines, we find that LEMoN outperforms the baselines by over 3% in label error detection, and that training on datasets filtered using our method improves downstream captioning performance by more than 2 BLEU points over noisy training.

Abstract: Text Recognition (TR) refers to the research area that focuses on retrieving textual information from images, a topic that has seen significant advancements in the last decade due to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, these solutions often necessitate vast amounts of manually labeled or synthetic data. Addressing this challenge, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained attention by utilizing large datasets of unlabeled data to train DNN, thereby generating meaningful and robust representations. Although SSL was initially overlooked in TR because of its unique characteristics, recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of SSL methods specifically for this field. This rapid development, however, has led to many methods being explored independently, without taking previous efforts in methodology or comparison into account, thereby hindering progress in the field of research. This paper, therefore, seeks to consolidate the use of SSL in the field of TR, offering a critical and comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. We will review and analyze the existing methods, compare their results, and highlight inconsistencies in the current literature. This thorough analysis aims to provide general insights into the field, propose standardizations, identify new research directions, and foster its proper development.

<title>Detection-Driven Object Count Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Accurately controlling object count in text-to-image generation remains a key challenge. Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process.
  Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image.
  We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting across diverse object categories.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in self-supervised learning. Mainstream PEFT methods add a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained backbone parameters fixed. These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone. Despite this success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity. Motivated by this, we propose Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP), a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework. TPP pre-trains target parameters, i.e., the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning, in an additional stage before PEFT. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the new parameters are trainable. A defined pretext task encourages the new parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data. Subsequently, when PEFT is employed, the pre-trained new parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing integration with various pre-trained backbones, pretext tasks, and PEFT methods. We evaluated the fine-tuning performance of our method on seven public datasets, covering four modalities and two task types. The results demonstrate that TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.

Abstract: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models.

Abstract: We propose Diff-Instruct* (DI*), a data-efficient post-training approach for one-step text-to-image generative models to improve its human preferences without requiring image data. Our method frames alignment as online reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which optimizes the one-step model to maximize human reward functions while being regularized to be kept close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the regularization, we introduce a novel general score-based divergence regularization that substantially improves performance as well as post-training stability. Although the general score-based RLHF objective is intractable to optimize, we derive a strictly equivalent tractable loss function in theory that can efficiently compute its \emph{gradient} for optimizations. We introduce \emph{DI*-SDXL-1step}, which is a 2.6B one-step text-to-image model at a resolution of $1024\times 1024$, post-trained from DMD2 w.r.t SDXL. \textbf{Our 2.6B \emph{DI*-SDXL-1step} model outperforms the 50-step 12B FLUX-dev model} in ImageReward, PickScore, and CLIP score on the Parti prompts benchmark while using only 1.88\% of the inference time. This result clearly shows that with proper post-training, the small one-step model is capable of beating huge multi-step diffusion models. Our model is open-sourced at this link: https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_star. We hope our findings can contribute to human-centric machine learning techniques.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new multimodal benchmark, ClaimReview2024+, featuring claims after the knowledge cutoff of GPT-4o, avoiding data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms the GPT-4o baselines, showing temporal generalizability and the potential for real-time fact-checking.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

Abstract: Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest. Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with 1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

Abstract: Advances in healthcare research have significantly enhanced our understanding of disease mechanisms, diagnostic precision, and therapeutic options. Yet, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide due to challenges in early and accurate diagnosis. While current lung cancer detection models show promise, there is considerable potential for further improving the accuracy for timely intervention. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid deep convolution model leveraging transfer learning, named the Maximum Sensitivity Neural Network (MSNN). MSNN is designed to improve the precision of lung cancer detection by refining sensitivity and specificity. This model has surpassed existing deep learning approaches through experimental validation, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 97%. By overlaying sensitivity maps onto lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, it enables the visualization of regions most indicative of malignant or benign classifications. This innovative method demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing lung cancer with minimal false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnoses.

Abstract: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase public at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

<title>Contrastive Representation Distillation via Multi-Scale Feature Decoupling</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of a small student network without increasing its parameter size by transferring knowledge from a large, pre-trained teacher network. In the feature space, different local regions within an individual global feature map often encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. However, previous methods mainly focus on transferring global feature knowledge, neglecting the decoupling of interdependent local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose MSDCRD, a novel contrastive representation distillation approach that explicitly performs multi-scale decoupling within the feature space. MSDCRD employs a multi-scale sliding-window pooling approach within the feature space to capture representations at various granularities effectively. This, in conjunction with sample categorization, facilitates efficient multi-scale feature decoupling. When integrated with a novel and effective contrastive loss function, this forms the core of MSDCRD. Feature representations differ significantly across network architectures, and this divergence becomes more pronounced in heterogeneous models, rendering feature distillation particularly challenging. Despite this, our method not only achieves superior performance in homogeneous models but also enables efficient feature knowledge transfer across a variety of heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, highlighting its strong generalizability. Moreover, its plug-and-play and parameter-free nature enables flexible integration with different visual tasks. Extensive experiments on different visual benchmarks consistently confirm the superiority of our method in enhancing the performance of student models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often struggle to recognize novel concepts, as they rely on pre-trained knowledge and have limited ability to capture subtle visual details. Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language, improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts, we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains in accuracy.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.

Abstract: In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

Abstract: In mixed reality applications, a realistic acoustic experience in spatial environments is as crucial as the visual experience for achieving true immersion. Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR, a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the realism of our dataset.

Abstract: The exponential increase in video content poses significant challenges in terms of efficient navigation, search, and retrieval, thus requiring advanced video summarization techniques. Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a "soft" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobustVP.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of irrigation methods is crucial for sustainable agricultural practices and food systems. However, existing models that rely solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii) bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US shows up to 22.9\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU) improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping, achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and cost-effective.

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points. Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

Abstract: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches, Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods, highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes. Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified framework of leading-edge place recognition methods, i.e., code library, and the results of their experimental evaluations are available at https://github.com/CV4RA/SOTA-Place-Recognitioner.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce \textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and 424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI dataset and accompanying codebase are openly available at https://github.com/hifexplo/Electrolyzers-HSI and https://rodare.hzdr.de/record/3668, supporting reproducible research and facilitating the broader adoption of smart and sustainable e-waste recycling solutions.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for zero-shot multi-object perception.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.

Abstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool that supports understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and settings, as well as data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown great potential for single-source domain generalization by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSegbased methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models employed in FetalSynthSeg outperform physics-informed generation methods in terms of OOD generalization. We further show that incorporating intensity clustering significantly enhances generalization in settings with limited label classes by producing more realistic synthetic data. By combining synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning on real images and applying weight-space interpolation between the two models, we propose DRIFTS as an effective and practical solution for single-source domain generalization. DRIFTS consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks and is, to our knowledge, the first method to achieve accurate brain tissue segmentation on fetal T1-weighted images. We validate our approach on 308 subjects from four datasets acquired at three different sites, covering a range of scanner field strengths (0.55T to 3T) and both T1w and T2w modalities. We conclude with five practical recommendations to guide the development of SynthSeg-based methods for other organs and imaging modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization, concentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving imbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.

<title>Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 24 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9\% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents. Our code and dataset are available at https://embodiedbench.github.io.

Abstract: Generating motion for arbitrary skeletons is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics, remaining largely unexplored due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the irregular nature of the data. In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing. Our webpage, https://anytop2025.github.io/Anytop-page, includes links to videos and code.

Abstract: This paper advances motion agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) toward autonomous navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments, significantly surpassing first and recent seminal but limited studies on LLM's spatial reasoning, where movements are restricted in four directions in simple, static environments in the presence of only single agents much less multiple agents. Specifically, we investigate LLMs as spatial reasoners to overcome these limitations by uniformly encoding environments (e.g., real indoor floorplans), agents which can be dynamic obstacles and their paths as discrete tokens akin to language tokens. Our training-free framework supports multi-agent coordination, closed-loop replanning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance without retraining or fine-tuning. We show that LLMs can generalize across agents, tasks, and environments using only text-based interactions, opening new possibilities for semantically grounded, interactive navigation in both simulation and embodied systems.

Abstract: Poisson Surface Reconstruction is a widely-used algorithm for reconstructing a surface from an oriented point cloud. To facilitate applications where only partial surface information is available, or scanning is performed sequentially, a recent line of work proposes to incorporate uncertainty into the reconstructed surface via Gaussian process models. The resulting algorithms first perform Gaussian process interpolation, then solve a set of volumetric partial differential equations globally in space, resulting in a computationally expensive two-stage procedure. In this work, we apply recently-developed techniques from geometric Gaussian processes to combine interpolation and surface reconstruction into a single stage, requiring only one linear solve per sample. The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be queried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric meshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic collision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray casting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform next-view planning on a per-ray basis. They also do not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with diagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations, unlike prior methods. Results show that our approach provides a cleaner, more-principled, and more-flexible stochastic surface reconstruction pipeline.

Abstract: Realistic digital garment modeling remains a labor-intensive task due to the intricate process of translating 2D sewing patterns into high-fidelity, simulation-ready 3D garments. We introduce GarmageNet, a unified generative framework that automates the creation of 2D sewing patterns, the construction of sewing relationships, and the synthesis of 3D garment initializations compatible with physics-based simulation. Central to our approach is Garmage, a novel garment representation that encodes each panel as a structured geometry image, effectively bridging the semantic and geometric gap between 2D structural patterns and 3D garment shapes. GarmageNet employs a latent diffusion transformer to synthesize panel-wise geometry images and integrates GarmageJigsaw, a neural module for predicting point-to-point sewing connections along panel contours. To support training and evaluation, we build GarmageSet, a large-scale dataset comprising over 10,000 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and style annotations. Our method demonstrates versatility and efficacy across multiple application scenarios, including scalable garment generation from multi-modal design concepts (text prompts, sketches, photographs), automatic modeling from raw flat sewing patterns, pattern recovery from unstructured point clouds, and progressive garment editing using conventional instructions-laying the foundation for fully automated, production-ready pipelines in digital fashion.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&amp;effective score compared to GPT-4V.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling. The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain (MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.) benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/OmniCharacter.

Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D robotic manipulation have improved grasping of everyday objects, but transparent and specular materials remain challenging due to depth sensing limitations. While several 3D reconstruction and depth completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this, leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically, given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene. Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection. Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction effectiveness of SR3D.

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.

Summary: 
This study proposes a unified framework for motion control in video generation by integrating camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. Unlike previous methods that handle these motion types separately, this approach combines user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models through a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or a mix of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to create temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. The framework shows superior performance in various video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects, dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments demonstrate better controllability and visual quality compared to existing methods and commercial solutions. The approach remains compatible with different state-of-the-art video generation backbones. <div>

This paper discusses the potential of CLIP, a model trained for aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, for image synthesis without the need for a decoder or fine-tuning. The approach focuses on optimizing an implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. Several techniques are introduced to stabilize the inverse mapping process, including adversarially robust initialization, Orthogonal Procrustes projection, and a blending loss. These methods enable capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction without modifying the weights of CLIP. The study suggests that discriminative models like CLIP may have untapped generative potential, opening up new possibilities for image synthesis applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Graph Flow Matching (GFM) as an enhancement to existing flow matching networks for sample generation tasks. GFM incorporates neighbor information through a diffusion term in addition to the standard reaction term, improving velocity predictions and enhancing generation quality. By leveraging a graph neural module, GFM effectively captures correlations between points along the generation trajectory, leading to improved Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and recall in image generation benchmarks. Operating within the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM offers a lightweight solution that enhances existing flow models with minimal additional computational cost. Overall, GFM demonstrates its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to deep flow architectures for improved sample generation outcomes. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

Summary:<br />
Surveillance cameras are increasingly being used to detect violence, leading to a need for automated violence detection systems. Current methods like CNNs and Transformers struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. In response, a new architecture called Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF) has been proposed. This architecture combines a dual-branch design with a state-space model (SSM) backbone to capture both spatial features and temporal dynamics efficiently. A new benchmark has been created by merging multiple datasets, ensuring a clear separation between training and testing sets.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics, with continuous fusion via a gating mechanism. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, real-time surveillance violence detection.

Abstract: Amid the challenges posed by global population growth and climate change, traditional agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) systems is currently undergoing a significant digital transformation to facilitate efficient big data processing. While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant challenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge, difficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic environments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge acquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address these challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric multimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with edge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data (images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal reasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management decisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main innovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural "perception-decision-action" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive monitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in mission-critical tasks, even under the limitations of edge computing resources. This work advances intelligent real-time agricultural solutions and highlights the potential for deeper integration of agricultural IoT with LLMs.

Abstract: Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span

Summary:<br />
This study addresses the risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious purposes by proposing a method to incorporate neural fingerprinting. Existing methods have not achieved 100% attribution accuracy, making them impractical for deployment. The proposed approach leverages cyclic error correcting codes from coding theory to improve accuracy. By combining neural fingerprinting with text-to-image diffusion models, the study aims to strike a balance between attribution accuracy and generation quality. The open-source nature of generative models underscores the need for robust risk mitigation strategies. The use of coding theory concepts adds a novel dimension to the field of neural fingerprinting for text-to-image models. The research contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat misuse of AI technologies for malicious intents.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses, especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved $100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect} accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial, multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions, advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network (AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout, zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation -- to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based, multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces AURA-MFM, a multimodal foundation model that integrates third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text data for detailed human activity analysis. By combining these modalities, the model offers a comprehensive understanding of human behavior that surpasses existing methods.

AURA-MFM addresses the limitations of previous models by providing a multidimensional perspective on human activity, making it a promising advancement in behavior analysis using wearable devices. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis. Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment - Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

<div> privacy concerns, multimodal large language models, video understanding applications, membership inference attacks, Sharma-Mittal entropy<br />
Summary:<br />
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are being increasingly used in video understanding applications, raising concerns about privacy due to the inclusion of sensitive video content in their training datasets. Existing methods for membership inference attacks (MIAs) in MLLMs are not effective for video data due to scalability and temporal variations. A new method, Vid-SME, tailored for video understanding LLMs (VULLMs), is introduced to address these challenges. Vid-SME computes Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs, leveraging the confidence of model outputs and adapting parameters for improved accuracy. By comparing SME differences between natural and temporally-reversed video frames, Vid-SME provides robust membership scores to identify videos in a model's training set. Experimental results on various VULLMs show that Vid-SME is highly effective in determining improperly used videos during training. <div>
arXiv:2506.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs). Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

Summary: 
The article introduces TerraIncognita, a benchmark designed to assess multimodal models' ability to identify unknown insect species from image data. The dataset combines images of known and rare species from underexplored biodiversity hotspots. Models are evaluated on hierarchical taxonomic classification, detection of novel species, and generation of taxonomically aligned explanations. Top models show high proficiency at the Order level but struggle at the Species level, indicating the difficulty of fine taxonomic prediction. TerraIncognita will be regularly updated with new species, providing a platform for long-term benchmarking. The dataset, results, and future updates are available online. <div>

Abstract: The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data. Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level, highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$ Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All TerraIncognita data, results, and future updates are available \href{https://baskargroup.github.io/TerraIncognita/}{here}.

<div> Keywords: Continual learning, model merging, stability, plasticity, vision-language models

Summary:
Continual learning is typically approached through sequential fine-tuning, leading to a bias towards recent tasks at the expense of retaining prior knowledge. In this study, the authors introduce a new method based on model merging to balance stability and plasticity. Rather than solely updating model weights sequentially, they propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones to achieve a better equilibrium. They also suggest a mechanism to promote learning aligned weights with existing ones to prevent interference during the merging process. Evaluation on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrates that this approach reduces forgetting, enhances robustness to different task orders and similarities, and boosts generalization capabilities. The findings suggest that model merging can effectively address the challenges of continual learning by maintaining stability while still allowing for adaptation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is conventionally tackled through sequential fine-tuning, a process that, while enabling adaptation, inherently favors plasticity over the stability needed to retain prior knowledge. While existing approaches attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a bias towards recent tasks persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights, we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones, promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

Summary: <br />
Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) face challenges in generalization ability under test-time distribution shifts. Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are limited in leveraging internal knowledge for dynamic adaptation of complex visual semantic information. To address this, Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT) is proposed, introducing a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB) to store key-value prompt pairs as memory of seen samples. At test time, relevant pairs are retrieved to create Associative Prompts for adaptive visual guidance. MINT utilizes learnable text prompts for rapid VLM adaptation without retraining. The framework allows precise customization of visual contextual guidance by dynamically assembling associative prompts leveraging stored memory. <div>

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge. The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue. Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid, precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory, without source data or retraining. The code is available at https://github.com/Jamieyi2004/MINT.

Summary: 
- Unintentional falls are a major health concern for seniors, necessitating the need for an automated fall detection system.
- The proposed system uses a pre-trained 3D CNN model to extract both spatial and temporal features, reducing training time.
- A SVM classifier is then trained to classify activities as either falls or ADL using stratified shuffle five split cross-validation.
- The model utilizes the Sports1M dataset for pre-training and is tested on the GMDCSA and CAUCAFall datasets.
- The source code for the system is available at https://github.com/ekramalam/HFD_3DCNN. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unintentional or accidental falls are one of the significant health issues in senior persons. The population of senior persons is increasing steadily. So, there is a need for an automated fall detection monitoring system. This paper introduces a vision-based fall detection system using a pre-trained 3D CNN. Unlike 2D CNN, 3D CNN extracts not only spatial but also temporal features. The proposed model leverages the original learned weights of a 3D CNN model pre-trained on the Sports1M dataset to extract the spatio-temporal features. Only the SVM classifier was trained, which saves the time required to train the 3D CNN. Stratified shuffle five split cross-validation has been used to split the dataset into training and testing data. Extracted features from the proposed 3D CNN model were fed to an SVM classifier to classify the activity as fall or ADL. Two datasets, GMDCSA and CAUCAFall, were utilized to conduct the experiment.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are proficient in high-level visual reasoning but struggle with nuanced perceptual tasks, as revealed by the new benchmark HueManity. The dataset consists of images with alphanumeric strings embedded in challenging dot patterns, testing precise pattern recognition abilities. When compared to human and traditional computer vision benchmarks, MLLMs exhibited a notable performance deficit, achieving only 33.6% accuracy on the numeric task and a mere 3% on the alphanumeric task. In contrast, humans achieved nearly perfect scores, and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. The study also delves into architectural and training paradigm factors contributing to MLLMs' perceptual limitations. To encourage further research in enhancing MLLMs' perceptual robustness, the HueManity dataset and code have been made open-source.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Summary:
AutoSEP is a novel iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework that aims to improve the fine-grained image classification capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in an unsupervised manner. By leveraging unlabeled data, AutoSEP learns a description prompt to guide MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within images, ultimately enhancing classification accuracy. The framework iteratively improves the prompt using instance-level classification scoring functions, without the need for training or fine-tuning. Evaluation on multiple fine-grained classification datasets shows that AutoSEP consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, with an average improvement of 13% over standard zero-shot classification and 5% over the best-performing baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the self-supervised optimization framework in enhancing MLLM performance for fine-grained image classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/yq-hong/AutoSEP

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces GenSeC-PC, a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication framework for efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) in autonomous driving and extended reality applications. GenSeC-PC combines images and point clouds using a semantic encoder and PointDif decoder for high compression efficiency and superior reconstruction.

Abstract: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality, efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important. In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC. GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission, improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D images, and previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model, OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract complementary functionality information from two modules and model their interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and targeted carbon mitigation planning.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a method for learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). The proposed collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method addresses the instance-dependent noise generated by pre-trained models, making learning more challenging. The approach involves training two neural networks simultaneously to purify training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism and enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both label and feature representation spaces. The method can also utilize few-shot manually annotated valid labels for improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach compared to other denoising algorithms, annotation methods, and pre-trained model application schemes. The study highlights the potential of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve "manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Transformers, Dynamic Sparsity, Inference Speedup, Image Generation, Video Generation

Summary: 
Chipmunk introduces dynamic sparsity at inference time to reduce redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) without retraining. By analyzing activations in two state-of-the-art DiTs, Chipmunk identifies the fastest-changing intermediate activations and caches the rest. To address the challenges of sparse operations underutilizing GPU tensor cores and introduce overhead, Chipmunk utilizes column-wise sparsity and overlaps computation with other tasks. This approach results in a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to dense baselines. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. When stacked on top of full step caching, Chipmunk achieves a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while maintaining minimal quality impact.  <div>
arXiv:2506.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.

<div> Keywords: optical flow estimation, neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, iterative refinements, improvement

Summary: 
Recent advancements in optical flow estimation have utilized neural networks to predict flow fields between images. Traditional approaches involve fixed-step iterations for refinement, potentially leading to suboptimal results. This paper introduces a novel method utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) to predict flow derivatives in a continuous model. This approach dynamically adjusts the number of compute steps based on input data, offering improved performance tailored to specific data characteristics. By employing a specific neural architecture and ODE solver, the proposed model can match the updates of existing recurrent cell methods, but with increased adaptability. Extensive experiments on optical flow benchmarks showcase significant enhancements over baseline and existing models, achieved with just a single refinement step. <div>
arXiv:2506.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works, offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a single refinement step.

Summary:
SportMamba is a new adaptive hybrid multi-object tracking technique designed specifically for dynamic team sports. It introduces a mamba-attention mechanism to model non-linear motion patterns and a height-adaptive spatial association metric to handle ID switches caused by occlusions. The technique also includes adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. SportMamba demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the challenging SportsMOT dataset, known for its complex motion and severe occlusions. Furthermore, the technique shows generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the VIP-HTD ice hockey dataset. The innovative approach of SportMamba addresses the difficulties in tracking players in fast-paced team sports scenarios with ambiguous appearance cues and non-linear motion patterns, making it a valuable tool for sports analytics and video analysis in sports broadcasting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

The authors address this challenge by introducing ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning strategy with a reverse reward to enhance AoT awareness. They also create AoTBench, a new benchmark for testing temporal understanding. Experiments demonstrate that ArrowRL significantly improves performance on both AoTBench and standard video question answering benchmarks.

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Controlling defects in semiconductor processes is important for maintaining yield, improving production cost, and preventing time-dependent critical component failures. Electron beam-based imaging has been used as a tool to survey wafers in the line and inspect for defects. However, manual classification of images for these nano-scale defects is limited by time, labor constraints, and human biases. In recent years, deep learning computer vision algorithms have shown to be effective solutions for image-based inspection applications in industry. This work proposes application of vision transformer (ViT) neural networks for automatic defect classification (ADC) of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of wafer defects. We evaluated our proposed methods on 300mm wafer semiconductor defect data from our fab in IBM Albany. We studied 11 defect types from over 7400 total images and investigated the potential of transfer learning of DinoV2 and semi-supervised learning for improved classification accuracy and efficient computation. We were able to achieve classification accuracies of over 90% with less than 15 images per defect class. Our work demonstrates the potential to apply the proposed framework for a platform agnostic in-house classification tool with faster turnaround time and flexibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled accurate image-based geolocation, raising serious concerns about location privacy risks in everyday social media posts. However, current benchmarks remain coarse-grained, linguistically biased, and lack multimodal and privacy-aware evaluations. To address these gaps, we present KoreaGEO Bench, the first fine-grained, multimodal geolocation benchmark for Korean street views. Our dataset comprises 1,080 high-resolution images sampled across four urban clusters and nine place types, enriched with multi-contextual annotations and two styles of Korean captions simulating real-world privacy exposure. We introduce a three-path evaluation protocol to assess ten mainstream VLMs under varying input modalities and analyze their accuracy, spatial bias, and reasoning behavior. Results reveal modality-driven shifts in localization precision and highlight structural prediction biases toward core cities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.

Summary: 
This study explores the connection between urban sounds and visual scenes in London, New York, and Tokyo by comparing different visual representation methods. Street view embeddings show better alignment with environmental sounds than segmentation outputs. Remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories following a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. Embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This research contributes to the field of multimodal urban sensing by providing insights on incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.

<div> EigenCL, unsupervised contrastive learning, crop stress detection, NDRE dynamics, precision agriculture<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
A new approach, EigenCL, for early detection of crop stress in precision agriculture is introduced. By utilizing over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, EigenCL constructs five-point NDRE time series per patch and derives an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector, strongly correlated with NDRE values, defines stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. This method, based on biologically similar stress trajectories, enables early stress detection up to 12 days before traditional NDRE thresholds, achieving superior clustering metrics and high accuracy in downstream classification tasks. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable solution aligned with plant physiology, suitable for deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments. Validation on an independent dataset confirms its generalizability without the need for retraining. <div>

Abstract: Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.

<div> Efficient Vision Foundation Models, ViT-Split, CNN, VFM, adapters <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces ViT-Split, a novel approach for enhancing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) by dividing the model into extractor and adapter components. By eliminating the CNN branch and incorporating task and prior heads, ViT-Split addresses early layer gradient backpropagation and reduces complexity. The extractor focuses on learning low-level features, while the adapter tailors task-specific features, improving efficiency. The prior head leverages multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing parameter tuning and overfitting. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks validate ViT-Split's efficacy and efficiency, showcasing up to a 4x reduction in training time while achieving comparable or superior results, particularly on the ADE20K dataset. Overall, ViT-Split offers a streamlined and effective solution for optimizing VFMs and enhancing performance across diverse visual tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to $4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared to other VFM adapters.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the GeoVis-GNN method, which combines visual and geometric features for improved Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition. By using dual-attention feature fusion and entity graph learning, the model progressively builds from entity-specific representations towards high-level interaction understanding. A new dataset, MPHOI-120, captures dynamic multi-person interactions with concurrent actions and partial engagement, addressing challenges like complex dynamics and occlusions. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various HOI scenarios, including two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent interactions. <div>
arXiv:2506.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time. Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in inversion and instruction-based image editing, existing approaches primarily excel at editing single, prominent objects but significantly struggle when applied to complex scenes containing multiple entities. To quantify this gap, we first introduce RefEdit-Bench, a rigorous real-world benchmark rooted in RefCOCO, where even baselines trained on millions of samples perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets, outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that our model not only excels in referring expression tasks but also enhances performance on traditional benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to closed-source methods. We release data \& checkpoint for reproducibility.

<br />
Summary: This paper explores the use of rendering engines, particularly Unreal Engine 4, to generate synthetic images for deep learning computer vision models. Synthetic images offer advantages such as reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of training data without internet threats. The study evaluates the validity of synthetic images by testing their impact on model accuracy in binary classification tasks. Results show that adding synthetic images to real datasets can improve test accuracy and reduce the gap between training and test accuracy. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that using synthetic images allows researchers to train models with only a fraction of real images typically required. Guidelines for creating and utilizing synthetic images are provided, highlighting the potential performance improvements for data-scarce projects in computer vision. <div>
arXiv:2506.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how rendering engines, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE), can be used to create synthetic images to supplement datasets for deep computer vision (CV) models in image abundant and image limited use cases. Using rendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a method of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training sets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images from the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these generated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in two different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs Dog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an implementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using pre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and small (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional synthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the test-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test accuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10% additional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the classification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more real training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from rendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during training, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an example of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images, potential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce projects.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a robust neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification in the presence of label errors. RoNFA comprises two neural fields for feature and category representation. Each neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field (RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the representative neuron for its category, determined through soft clustering. During the prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts based on neuronal activation in FCR for improved accuracy. Experimental results on real-world FSL datasets with various label noise types show that RoNFA outperforms existing FSL methods. Its accuracy with noisy labels exceeds that of state-of-the-art methods trained on clean support sets, highlighting its robustness against label errors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label errors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are inevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model in the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification with noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category representation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field (RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the representative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the neuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning strategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning capability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results on real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even surpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean support sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition has received widespread attention in recent years due to its diverse range of application scenarios. Due to the different sources of human skeletons, skeleton data naturally exhibit heterogeneity. The previous works, however, overlook the heterogeneity of human skeletons and solely construct models tailored for homogeneous skeletons. This work addresses the challenge of heterogeneous skeleton-based action representation learning, specifically focusing on processing skeleton data that varies in joint dimensions and topological structures. The proposed framework comprises two primary components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified representation learning. The former first converts two-dimensional skeleton data into three-dimensional skeleton via an auxiliary network, and then constructs a prompted unified skeleton using skeleton-specific prompts. We also design an additional modality named semantic motion encoding to harness the semantic information within skeletons. The latter module learns a unified action representation using a shared backbone network that processes different heterogeneous skeletons. Extensive experiments on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various tasks of action understanding. Our approach can be applied to action recognition in robots with different humanoid structures.

The paper introduces CHIME, a framework designed to enhance time series diffusion models. CHIME addresses challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. By utilizing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures decomposed features to align the distribution of generated and original samples. The framework also includes a feature hallucination module that transfers temporal features during the conditional denoising process, enhancing category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that CHIME outperforms existing models, particularly in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generative generalization capabilities. <div>

Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.

This paper introduces a new lightweight event-based optical flow network called EDCFlow that aims to improve flow estimation at higher resolutions. The network utilizes a multi-scale temporal feature difference layer to efficiently capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution. By adaptively fusing high-resolution difference motion features with low-resolution correlation motion features, EDCFlow enhances motion representation and model generalization. Additionally, EDCFlow can be used as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Experimental results show that EDCFlow outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and complexity, offering superior generalization. <div>

Abstract: Recent learning-based methods for event-based optical flow estimation utilize cost volumes for pixel matching but suffer from redundant computations and limited scalability to higher resolutions for flow refinement. In this work, we take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.

<div> Keywords: Direct Preference Optimization, text-to-video diffusion models, DenseDPO, motion generation, Vision Language Models

Summary:
DenseDPO introduces a method to improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for text-to-video diffusion models. By using denoised copies of ground truth videos to create pairs for preference labeling, motion bias is neutralized, resulting in better motion generation. This method also allows for labeling preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, leading to a denser and more precise learning signal. DenseDPO achieves improvements in motion generation while maintaining text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency compared to vanilla DPO. Additionally, DenseDPO enables automatic preference annotation using Vision Language Models, with GPT accurately predicting segment-level preferences. By training on these predicted labels, DenseDPO performance is close to using human labels. This new approach addresses the limitations of traditional DPO methods and enhances the capabilities of text-to-video diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.

Summary: 
The article introduces Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) that focuses on transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain dealing with domain and unknown category shifts. It addresses the challenge of identifying common class samples and aligning them by searching for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text representation space. The proposed method, TArget Semantics Clustering (TASC), uses information maximization as an objective in two stages: searching for optimal text embeddings and refining encoders for domain alignment and private class clustering. Additionally, Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS) is introduced for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally tested on four benchmarks, the method proves effective and robust, achieving state-of-the-art performance in adapting to category shift scenarios. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) focuses on transferring source domain knowledge to the target domain under both domain shift and unknown category shift. Its main challenge lies in identifying common class samples and aligning them. Current methods typically obtain target domain semantics centers from an unconstrained continuous image representation space. Due to domain shift and the unknown number of clusters, these centers often result in complex and less robust alignment algorithm. In this paper, based on vision-language models, we search for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text representation space. The constrained space ensures almost no domain bias and appropriate semantic granularity for these centers, enabling a simple and robust adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we propose TArget Semantics Clustering (TASC) via Text Representations, which leverages information maximization as a unified objective and involves two stages. First, with the frozen encoders, a greedy search-based framework is used to search for an optimal set of text embeddings to represent target semantics. Second, with the search results fixed, encoders are refined based on gradient descent, simultaneously achieving robust domain alignment and private class clustering. Additionally, we propose Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS), a scoring function tailored for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally, we evaluate the universality of UniDA algorithms under four category shift scenarios. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Video-Skill-CoT (Video-SKoT) framework for domain-adaptive video reasoning by leveraging skill-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. The framework extracts domain-specific reasoning skills from training questions, clusters them into a shared skill taxonomy, and creates detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair. It then employs skill-specific expert learning modules, each specializing in a subset of reasoning skills and trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on three video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness. In-depth analyses are also provided, comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a framework for 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images. It addresses challenges such as inconsistent lighting conditions and artifacts by training two 3D Gaussian Splatting models in parallel. These models are guided by a consistency constraint to converge on reliable scene geometry while suppressing artifacts. To prevent shared failures, divergent masking strategies are employed, including multi-cue adaptive masks and self-supervised soft masks. A lightweight variant, Dynamic EMA Proxy, enhances efficiency by using an Exponential Moving Average proxy and alternating masking. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods and high efficiency. The codes and trained models will be made available for further research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal image fusion effectively aggregates information from diverse modalities, with fused images playing a crucial role in vision systems. However, existing methods often neglect frequency-domain feature exploration and interactive relationships. In this paper, we propose wavelet-aware Intra-inter Frequency Enhancement Fusion (WIFE-Fusion), a multimodal image fusion framework based on frequency-domain components interactions. Its core innovations include: Intra-Frequency Self-Attention (IFSA) that leverages inherent cross-modal correlations and complementarity through interactive self-attention mechanisms to extract enriched frequency-domain features, and Inter-Frequency Interaction (IFI) that enhances enriched features and filters latent features via combinatorial interactions between heterogeneous frequency-domain components across modalities. These processes achieve precise source feature extraction and unified modeling of feature extraction-aggregation. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate WIFE-Fusion's superiority over current specialized and unified fusion methods.

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2506.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements, with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/ControlThinker.

Abstract: Learning to use tools or objects in common scenes, particularly handling them in various ways as instructed, is a key challenge for developing interactive robots. Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.

Abstract: Edge computing decentralizes processing power to network edge, enabling real-time AI-driven decision-making in IoT applications. In industrial automation such as robotics and rugged edge AI, real-time perception and intelligence are critical for autonomous operations. Deploying transformer-based image captioning models at the edge can enhance machine perception, improve scene understanding for autonomous robots, and aid in industrial inspection.
  However, these edge or IoT devices are often constrained in computational resources for physical agility, yet they have strict response time requirements. Traditional deep learning models can be too large and computationally demanding for these devices. In this research, we present findings of transformer-based models for image captioning that operate effectively on edge devices. By evaluating resource-effective transformer models and applying knowledge distillation techniques, we demonstrate inference can be accelerated on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model performance using these techniques.

Abstract: Detecting lesions in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task in medical image processing due to the diverse types, sizes, and locations of lesions. Recently, various one-stage and two-stage framework networks have been developed to focus on lesion localization. We introduce a one-stage lesion detection framework, PDSE, by redesigning Retinanet to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency for detecting lesions in multimodal CT images. Specifically, we enhance the path aggregation flow by incorporating a low-level feature map. Additionally, to improve model representation, we utilize the adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block and integrate channel feature map attention. This approach has resulted in achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our method significantly improves the detection of small and multiscaled objects. When evaluated against other advanced algorithms on the public DeepLesion benchmark, our algorithm achieved an mAP of over 0.20.

<title>VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches</title>

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

<title>Isharah: A Large-Scale Multi-Scene Dataset for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>

Abstract: Current benchmarks for sign language recognition (SLR) focus mainly on isolated SLR, while there are limited datasets for continuous SLR (CSLR), which recognizes sequences of signs in a video. Additionally, existing CSLR datasets are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset of its type and size that has been collected in an unconstrained environment using signers' smartphone cameras. This setup resulted in high variations of recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of 30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally, the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT. The Isharah dataset is available on https://snalyami.github.io/Isharah_CSLR/.

<title>Negative-Guided Subject Fidelity Optimization for Zero-Shot Subject-Driven Generation</title>

arXiv:2506.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

Abstract: A major challenge in finger vein recognition is the lack of large-scale public datasets. Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn, we created FingerVeinSyn-5M -- the largest available finger vein dataset -- containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100 variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels, skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and fine-tuned with minimal real data achieve an average 53.91\% performance gain across multiple benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/EvanWang98/FingerVeinSyn-5M.

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

<title>Images are Worth Variable Length of Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03643</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://dove-encoder.github.io/dove-encoder.

<title>YOND: Practical Blind Raw Image Denoising Free from Camera-Specific Data Dependency</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03645</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of photography has created a growing demand for a practical blind raw image denoising method. Recently, learning-based methods have become mainstream due to their excellent performance. However, most existing learning-based methods suffer from camera-specific data dependency, resulting in performance drops when applied to data from unknown cameras. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel blind raw image denoising method named YOND, which represents You Only Need a Denoiser. Trained solely on synthetic data, YOND can generalize robustly to noisy raw images captured by diverse unknown cameras. Specifically, we propose three key modules to guarantee the practicality of YOND: coarse-to-fine noise estimation (CNE), expectation-matched variance-stabilizing transform (EM-VST), and SNR-guided denoiser (SNR-Net). Firstly, we propose CNE to identify the camera noise characteristic, refining the estimated noise parameters based on the coarse denoised image. Secondly, we propose EM-VST to eliminate camera-specific data dependency, correcting the bias expectation of VST according to the noisy image. Finally, we propose SNR-Net to offer controllable raw image denoising, supporting adaptive adjustments and manual fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on unknown cameras, along with flexible solutions for challenging cases, demonstrate the superior practicality of our method. The source code will be publicly available at the \href{https://fenghansen.github.io/publication/YOND}{project homepage}.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, text-to-image generation has achieved significant progress in image resolution, detail fidelity, and semantic alignment, particularly with models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, Stable Diffusion XL, and FLUX 1. However, generating emotionally expressive and abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g., Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line, light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally aligned images from text. Our work provides essential data and benchmarks for emotion-driven image synthesis and aims to advance fields such as affective computing, multimodal learning, and computational art, enabling applications in art therapy and creative design. The dataset and more details can be accessed via our project website.

<title>MambaNeXt-YOLO: A Hybrid State Space Model for Real-time Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.

<title>INP-Former++: Advancing Universal Anomaly Detection via Intrinsic Normal Prototypes and Residual Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03660</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03660</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed method significantly improves detection performance across single-class, multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

<title>Zero-Shot Temporal Interaction Localization for Egocentric Videos</title>

arXiv:2506.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in middle-aged groups.

Abstract: This paper introduces a preprocessing technique to speed up Structure-from-Motion (SfM) based pose estimation, which is critical for real-time applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and robotics. Our method leverages the concept of a dominating set from graph theory to preprocess SfM models, significantly enhancing the speed of the pose estimation process without losing significant accuracy. Using the OnePose dataset, we evaluated our method across various SfM-based pose estimation techniques. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in processing speed, ranging from 1.5 to 14.48 times, and a reduction in reference images and point cloud size by factors of 17-23 and 2.27-4, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate 3D pose estimation, balancing speed and accuracy in real-time applications.

<title>BiXFormer: A Robust Framework for Maximizing Modality Effectiveness in Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03675</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching (MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.

<title>How PARTs assemble into wholes: Learning the relative composition of images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled remarkable creative capabilities, yet it also raises urgent concerns regarding the safety of AI-generated visual content in real-world applications such as content moderation, platform governance, and digital media regulation. This includes unsafe material such as sexually explicit images, violent scenes, hate symbols, propaganda, and unauthorized imitations of copyrighted artworks. Existing image safety systems often rely on rigid category filters and produce binary outputs, lacking the capacity to interpret context or reason about nuanced, adversarially induced forms of harm. In addition, standard evaluation metrics (e.g., attack success rate) fail to capture the semantic severity and dynamic progression of toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Retrieval-Judgement (PRJ), a cognitively inspired framework that models toxicity detection as a structured reasoning process. PRJ follows a three-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language (perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and traits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative rules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect both explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical granularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a contextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different semantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety checkers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting structured category-level toxicity interpretation.

Abstract: In the childbirth process, traditional methods involve invasive vaginal examinations, but research has shown that these methods are both subjective and inaccurate. Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis offers an objective yet effective way to assess fetal head position via two key parameters: Angle of Progression (AoP) and Head-Symphysis Distance (HSD), calculated by segmenting the fetal head (FH) and pubic symphysis (PS), which aids clinicians in ensuring a smooth delivery process. Therefore, accurate segmentation of FH and PS is crucial. In this work, we propose a sparse self-attention network architecture with good performance and high computational efficiency, named DSSAU-Net, for the segmentation of FH and PS. Specifically, we stack varying numbers of Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) blocks at each stage to form a symmetric U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture. For a given query, DSSA is designed to explicitly perform one sparse token selection at both the region and pixel levels, respectively, which is beneficial for further reducing computational complexity while extracting the most relevant features. To compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, skip connections with convolutions are designed. Additionally, multiscale feature fusion is employed to enrich the model's global and local information. The performance of DSSAU-Net has been validated using the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024 \textit{test set} provided by the organizer in the MICCAI IUGC 2024 competition\footnote{\href{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18413\#learn\_the\_details}{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18413\#learn\_the\_details}}, where we win the fourth place on the tasks of classification and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) involves assigning labels to each pixel in an image based on textual descriptions, leveraging world models like CLIP. However, they encounter significant challenges in cross-domain generalization, hindering their practical efficacy in real-world applications. Embodied AI systems are transforming autonomous navigation for ground vehicles and drones by enhancing their perception abilities, and in this study, we present AetherVision-Bench, a benchmark for multi-angle segmentation across aerial, and ground perspectives, which facilitates an extensive evaluation of performance across different viewing angles and sensor modalities. We assess state-of-the-art OVSS models on the proposed benchmark and investigate the key factors that impact the performance of zero-shot transfer models. Our work pioneers the creation of a robustness benchmark, offering valuable insights and establishing a foundation for future research.

Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solutions for the three egocentric video localization tracks of the Ego4D Episodic Memory Challenge at CVPR 2025. All tracks require precise localization of the interval within an untrimmed egocentric video. Previous unified video localization approaches often rely on late fusion strategies, which tend to yield suboptimal results. To address this, we adopt an early fusion-based video localization model to tackle all three tasks, aiming to enhance localization accuracy. Ultimately, our method achieved first place in the Natural Language Queries, Goal Step, and Moment Queries tracks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods aim to predict the 3D structure of a scene directly from input images, providing a faster alternative to per-scene optimization approaches. Significant progress has been made in single-view and few-view reconstruction using learned priors that infer object shape and appearance, even for unobserved regions. However, there is substantial potential to enhance these methods by better leveraging information from multiple views when available. To address this, we propose a few-view reconstruction model that more effectively harnesses multi-view information. Our approach introduces a simple mechanism that connects the 3D representation with pixel rays from the input views, allowing for preferential sharing of information between nearby 3D locations and between 3D locations and nearby pixel rays. We achieve this by defining the 3D representation as a set of structured, feature-augmented lines; the Pl\"uckeRF representation. Using this representation, we demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality over the equivalent triplane representation and state-of-the-art feedforward reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Fully sparse 3D detectors have recently gained significant attention due to their efficiency in long-range detection. However, sparse 3D detectors extract features only from non-empty voxels, which impairs long-range interactions and causes the center feature missing. The former weakens the feature extraction capability, while the latter hinders network optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fully Sparse Hybrid Network (FSHNet). FSHNet incorporates a proposed SlotFormer block to enhance the long-range feature extraction capability of existing sparse encoders. The SlotFormer divides sparse voxels using a slot partition approach, which, compared to traditional window partition, provides a larger receptive field. Additionally, we propose a dynamic sparse label assignment strategy to deeply optimize the network by providing more high-quality positive samples. To further enhance performance, we introduce a sparse upsampling module to refine downsampled voxels, preserving fine-grained details crucial for detecting small objects. Extensive experiments on the Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FSHNet. The code is available at https://github.com/Say2L/FSHNet.

<title>ComRoPE: Scalable and Robust Rotary Position Embedding Parameterized by Trainable Commuting Angle Matrices</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position. Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity. In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation, which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new insights for future positional encoding research.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However, current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have, respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial & Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same quantity of parameters.

Abstract: Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides, we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be released when this paper is published.

<title>CoLa: Chinese Character Decomposition with Compositional Latent Components</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Humans can decompose Chinese characters into compositional components and recombine them to recognize unseen characters. This reflects two cognitive principles: Compositionality, the idea that complex concepts are built on simpler parts; and Learning-to-learn, the ability to learn strategies for decomposing and recombining components to form new concepts. These principles provide inductive biases that support efficient generalization. They are critical to Chinese character recognition (CCR) in solving the zero-shot problem, which results from the common long-tail distribution of Chinese character datasets. Existing methods have made substantial progress in modeling compositionality via predefined radical or stroke decomposition. However, they often ignore the learning-to-learn capability, limiting their ability to generalize beyond human-defined schemes. Inspired by these principles, we propose a deep latent variable model that learns Compositional Latent components of Chinese characters (CoLa) without relying on human-defined decomposition schemes. Recognition and matching can be performed by comparing compositional latent components in the latent space, enabling zero-shot character recognition. The experiments illustrate that CoLa outperforms previous methods in both character the radical zero-shot CCR. Visualization indicates that the learned components can reflect the structure of characters in an interpretable way. Moreover, despite being trained on historical documents, CoLa can analyze components of oracle bone characters, highlighting its cross-dataset generalization ability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like, context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Automatically estimating animal poses from videos is important for studying animal behaviors. Existing methods do not perform reliably since they are trained on datasets that are not comprehensive enough to capture all necessary animal behaviors. However, it is very challenging to collect such datasets due to the large variations in animal morphology. In this paper, we propose an animal pose labeling pipeline that follows a different strategy, i.e. test time optimization. Given a video, we fine-tune a lightweight appearance embedding inside a pre-trained general-purpose point tracker on a sparse set of annotated frames. These annotations can be obtained from human labelers or off-the-shelf pose detectors. The fine-tuned model is then applied to the rest of the frames for automatic labeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a reasonable annotation cost. We believe our pipeline offers a valuable tool for the automatic quantification of animal behavior.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Video transformer models require huge amounts of compute resources due to the spatio-temporal scaling of the input. Tackling this, recent methods have proposed to drop or merge tokens for image models, whether randomly or via learned methods. Merging tokens has many benefits: it can be plugged into any vision transformer, does not require model re-training, and it propagates information that would otherwise be dropped through the model. Before now, video token merging has not been evaluated on temporally complex datasets for video understanding. In this work, we explore training-free token merging for video to provide comprehensive experiments and find best practices across four video transformers on three datasets that exhibit coarse and fine-grained action recognition. Our results showcase the benefits of video token merging with a speedup of around $2.5$X while maintaining accuracy (avg. $-0.55\%$ for ViViT).

<title>Joint Video Enhancement with Deblurring, Super-Resolution, and Frame Interpolation Network</title>

Abstract: Video quality is often severely degraded by multiple factors rather than a single factor. These low-quality videos can be restored to high-quality videos by sequentially performing appropriate video enhancement techniques. However, the sequential approach was inefficient and sub-optimal because most video enhancement approaches were designed without taking into account that multiple factors together degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose a new joint video enhancement method that mitigates multiple degradation factors simultaneously by resolving an integrated enhancement problem. Our proposed network, named DSFN, directly produces a high-resolution, high-frame-rate, and clear video from a low-resolution, low-frame-rate, and blurry video. In the DSFN, low-resolution and blurry input frames are enhanced by a joint deblurring and super-resolution (JDSR) module. Meanwhile, intermediate frames between input adjacent frames are interpolated by a triple-frame-based frame interpolation (TFBFI) module. The proper combination of the proposed modules of DSFN can achieve superior performance on the joint video enhancement task. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other sequential state-of-the-art techniques on public datasets with a smaller network size and faster processing time.

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based cameras, especially in scenarios involving rapid motion or challenging lighting conditions. However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise, negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise. Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data, enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets (N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object classification system.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a practical cross-domain few-shot learning (pCDFSL) task, where a large-scale pre-trained model like CLIP can be easily deployed on a target dataset. The goal is to simultaneously classify all unseen classes under extreme domain shifts, by utilizing only a few labeled samples per class. The pCDFSL paradigm is source-free and moves beyond artificially created episodic training and testing regimes followed by existing CDFSL frameworks, making it more challenging and relevant to real-world applications. Towards that goal, we propose a novel framework, termed MIST (MultIple STochastic Prompt tuning), where multiple stochastic prompts are utilized to handle significant domain and semantic shifts. Specifically, multiple prompts are learnt for each class, effectively capturing multiple peaks in the input data. Furthermore, instead of representing the weights of the multiple prompts as point-estimates, we model them as learnable Gaussian distributions with two different strategies, encouraging an efficient exploration of the prompt parameter space, which mitigate overfitting due to the few labeled training samples. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on four CDFSL benchmarks adapted to this setting, show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model. Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \& Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time, thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows. We share our code here: https://github.com/cai4cai/Average-Calibration-Losses

Abstract: Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work, we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/aimagelab/RAID and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/RAID.

Abstract: Recent advances in few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have greatly expanded their ability to generalize across tasks using only a few labeled examples. However, existing approaches primarily build upon the strong zero-shot priors of these models by leveraging carefully designed, task-specific prompts. This dependence on predefined class names can restrict their applicability, especially in scenarios where exact class names are unavailable or difficult to specify. To address this limitation, we introduce vocabulary-free few-shot learning for VLMs, a setting where target class instances - that is, images - are available but their corresponding names are not. We propose Similarity Mapping (SiM), a simple yet effective baseline that classifies target instances solely based on similarity scores with a set of generic prompts (textual or visual), eliminating the need for carefully handcrafted prompts. Although conceptually straightforward, SiM demonstrates strong performance, operates with high computational efficiency (learning the mapping typically takes less than one second), and provides interpretability by linking target classes to generic prompts. We believe that our approach could serve as an important baseline for future research in vocabulary-free few-shot learning. Code is available at https://github.com/MaxZanella/vocabulary-free-FSL.

<title>Rex-Thinker: Grounded Object Referring via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04034</link>

Abstract: Object referring aims to detect all objects in an image that match a given natural language description. We argue that a robust object referring model should be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and faithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key properties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies its predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy, by learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given expression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box prediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject expressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a model that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given a referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances corresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs step-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the given expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by prompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a structured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to learn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train Rex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach the model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL learning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability on in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Monitoring aerial objects is crucial for security, wildlife conservation, and environmental studies. Traditional RGB-based approaches struggle with challenges such as scale variations, motion blur, and high-speed object movements, especially for small flying entities like insects and drones. In this work, we explore the potential of event-based vision for detecting and recognizing flying objects, in particular animals that may not follow short and long-term predictable patters. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution, low latency, and robustness to motion blur, making them well-suited for this task. We introduce EV-Flying, an event-based dataset of flying objects, comprising manually annotated birds, insects and drones with spatio-temporal bounding boxes and track identities. To effectively process the asynchronous event streams, we employ a point-based approach leveraging lightweight architectures inspired by PointNet. Our study investigates the classification of flying objects using point cloud-based event representations. The proposed dataset and methodology pave the way for more efficient and reliable aerial object recognition in real-world scenarios.

<title>Video Deblurring with Deconvolution and Aggregation Networks</title>

Abstract: In contrast to single-image deblurring, video deblurring has the advantage that neighbor frames can be utilized to deblur a target frame. However, existing video deblurring algorithms often fail to properly employ the neighbor frames, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a deconvolution and aggregation network (DAN) for video deblurring that utilizes the information of neighbor frames well. In DAN, both deconvolution and aggregation strategies are achieved through three sub-networks: the preprocessing network (PPN) and the alignment-based deconvolution network (ABDN) for the deconvolution scheme; the frame aggregation network (FAN) for the aggregation scheme. In the deconvolution part, blurry inputs are first preprocessed by the PPN with non-local operations. Then, the output frames from the PPN are deblurred by the ABDN based on the frame alignment. In the FAN, these deblurred frames from the deconvolution part are combined into a latent frame according to reliability maps which infer pixel-wise sharpness. The proper combination of three sub-networks can achieve favorable performance on video deblurring by using the neighbor frames suitably. In experiments, the proposed DAN was demonstrated to be superior to existing state-of-the-art methods through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public datasets.

Abstract: We introduce GlobalBuildingAtlas, a publicly available dataset providing global and complete coverage of building polygons, heights and Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) 3D building models. This is the first open dataset to offer high quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights (called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons, including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide, GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1 billion buildings. GBA.Height offers the most detailed and accurate global 3D building height maps to date, achieving a spatial resolution of 3x3 meters-30 times finer than previous global products (90 m), enabling a high-resolution and reliable analysis of building volumes at both local and global scales. Finally, we generated a global LoD1 building model (called GBA.LoD1) from the resulting GBA.Polygon and GBA.Height. GBA.LoD1 represents the first complete global LoD1 building models, including 2.68 billion building instances with predicted heights, i.e., with a height completeness of more than 97%, achieving RMSEs ranging from 1.5 m to 8.9 m across different continents. With its height accuracy, comprehensive global coverage and rich spatial details, GlobalBuildingAltas offers novel insights on the status quo of global buildings, which unlocks unprecedented geospatial analysis possibilities, as showcased by a better illustration of where people live and a more comprehensive monitoring of the progress on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated, varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV, LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The present paper is an extended version of the earlier conference paper by Brument et al. (in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024), featuring an accelerated and more robust algorithm as well as a broader empirical evaluation.

<title>Contour Errors: An Ego-Centric Metric for Reliable 3D Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

<title>UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation</title>

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos) of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1) a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.

<title>MMR-V: What's Left Unsaid? A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos</title>

Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame. (2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only 52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies (Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains. We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a very important task in video surveillance systems such as tracking people, finding people in public places, or analysing customer behavior in supermarkets. Although there have been many works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data (attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO), Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art Re-ID methods.

arXiv:2506.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has enabled various applications in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis due to its efficient rendering capabilities. However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\&amp;Temples scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://flexgs.github.io.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning language-aligned visual representations.

Abstract: Object detectors often suffer a decrease in performance due to the large domain gap between the training data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain). Diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable abilities in generating high-quality and diverse images, suggesting their potential for extracting valuable feature from various domains. To effectively leverage the cross-domain feature representation of diffusion models, in this paper, we train a detector with frozen-weight diffusion model on the source domain, then employ it as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels on the unlabeled target domain, which are used to guide the supervised learning of the student model on the target domain. We refer to this approach as Diffusion Domain Teacher (DDT). By employing this straightforward yet potent framework, we significantly improve cross-domain object detection performance without compromising the inference speed. Our method achieves an average mAP improvement of 21.2% compared to the baseline on 6 datasets from three common cross-domain detection benchmarks (Cross-Camera, Syn2Real, Real2Artistic}, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average of 5.7% mAP. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently brings improvements even in more powerful and complex models, highlighting broadly applicable and effective domain adaptation capability of our DDT.

<title>FullDiT2: Efficient In-Context Conditioning for Video Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2 leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention. Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3 times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging, especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated audio aligns with selected objects.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations (e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens, the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless, direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.

Abstract: Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: We introduce Oxford Day-and-Night, a large-scale, egocentric dataset for novel view synthesis (NVS) and visual relocalisation under challenging lighting conditions. Existing datasets often lack crucial combinations of features such as ground-truth 3D geometry, wide-ranging lighting variation, and full 6DoF motion. Oxford Day-and-Night addresses these gaps by leveraging Meta ARIA glasses to capture egocentric video and applying multi-session SLAM to estimate camera poses, reconstruct 3D point clouds, and align sequences captured under varying lighting conditions, including both day and night. The dataset spans over 30 $\mathrm{km}$ of recorded trajectories and covers an area of 40,000 $\mathrm{m}^2$, offering a rich foundation for egocentric 3D vision research. It supports two core benchmarks, NVS and relocalisation, providing a unique platform for evaluating models in realistic and diverse environments.

Abstract: Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera trajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D reconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo). Our method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data Engine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality and geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.

Abstract: We present LayerFlow, a unified solution for layer-aware video generation. Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent foreground, clean background, and blended scene. It also supports versatile variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus generating smooth videos with desired layers.

<title>mRAG: Elucidating the Design Space of Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: CubeSats offer a low-cost platform for space research, particularly for Earth observation. However, their resource-constrained nature and being in space, challenge the flexibility and complexity of the deployed image processing pipelines and their orchestration. This paper introduces two novel systems, DIPP and DISH, to address these challenges. DIPP is a modular and configurable image processing pipeline framework that allows for adaptability to changing mission goals even after deployment, while preserving robustness. DISH is a domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors.
  Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module uploads. Furthermore, we compare DISH to Lua, a general purpose scripting language, and demonstrate its comparable expressiveness and lower memory requirement.

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse learning scenarios, significantly impacting their performance and reliability. This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models must integrate information from different sources with inherent uncertainties. We propose Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL), a unified framework that effectively handles feature uncertainty in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. DUAL introduces three key innovations: Dynamic Feature Uncertainty Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy on CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.

<title>Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view</title>

Abstract: Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce radiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating precise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains challenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for contextual understanding. Existing models often struggle with maintaining both accuracy and contextual relevance. In this paper, we present LLaMA-XR, a novel framework that integrates LLaMA 3.1 with DenseNet-121-based image embeddings and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments conducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L score of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance benchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an effective and efficient AI system for automated radiology reporting, offering enhanced clinical utility and reliability.

Abstract: Digitizing cultural heritage collections has become crucial for preservation of historical artifacts and enhancing their availability to the wider public. Galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM institutions) are actively digitizing their holdings and creates extensive digital collections. Those collections are often enriched with metadata describing items but not exactly their contents. The Jagiellonian Digital Library, standing as a good example of such an effort, offers datasets accessible through protocols like OAI-PMH. Despite these improvements, metadata completeness and standardization continue to pose substantial obstacles, limiting the searchability and potential connections between collections. To deal with these challenges, we explore an integrated methodology of computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI), and semantic web technologies to enrich metadata and construct knowledge graphs for digitized manuscripts and incunabula.

<title>Dc-EEMF: Pushing depth-of-field limit of photoacoustic microscopy via decision-level constrained learning</title>

Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy holds the potential to measure biomarkers' structural and functional status without labels, which significantly aids in comprehending pathophysiological conditions in biomedical research. However, conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is hindered by a limited depth-of-field (DoF) due to the narrow depth range focused on a Gaussian beam. Consequently, it fails to resolve sufficient details in the depth direction. Herein, we propose a decision-level constrained end-to-end multi-focus image fusion (Dc-EEMF) to push DoF limit of PAM. The DC-EEMF method is a lightweight siamese network that incorporates an artifact-resistant channel-wise spatial frequency as its feature fusion rule. The meticulously crafted U-Net-based perceptual loss function for decision-level focus properties in end-to-end fusion seamlessly integrates the complementary advantages of spatial domain and transform domain methods within Dc-EEMF. This approach can be trained end-to-end without necessitating post-processing procedures. Experimental results and numerical analyses collectively demonstrate our method's robust performance, achieving an impressive fusion result for PAM images without a substantial sacrifice in lateral resolution. The utilization of Dc-EEMF-powered PAM has the potential to serve as a practical tool in preclinical and clinical studies requiring extended DoF for various applications.

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage, and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI, where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands. Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches, which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research. Data and code are available at https://github.com/panliangrui/ACM_MM_2025.

Abstract: Retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Macular Hole (MH) significantly impact vision and affect millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial, as DR, a complication of diabetes, damages retinal blood vessels, potentially leading to blindness, while MH disrupts central vision, affecting tasks like reading and facial recognition. This paper employed two lightweight and efficient Convolution Neural Network architectures, MobileNet and NASNetMobile, for the classification of Normal, DR, and MH retinal images. The models were trained on the RFMiD dataset, consisting of 3,200 fundus images, after undergoing preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation. To address data scarcity, this study leveraged transfer learning and data augmentation techniques, enhancing model generalization and performance. The experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy of 90.8%, outperforming NASNetMobile, which achieved 89.5% accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in retinal disease classification, providing a foundation for AI-assisted ophthalmic diagnosis and early intervention.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000 individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost, multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images, which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions. The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess critical parameters related to wound care.

Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies' heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades, surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection. Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs, incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness, and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13. Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial index (CI).

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level computer vision, where deep learning technologies have played a significant role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution models, investigating each component and discussing its implications. Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends, requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level taxonomy to guide current and future VSR research, enhancing the maturation and interpretation of VSR practices for various practical applications.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Quantification of amyloid plaques (A), neurofibrillary tangles (T2), and neurodegeneration (N) using PET and MRI is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and prognosis. Existing pipelines face limitations regarding processing time, variability in tracer types, and challenges in multimodal integration.
  METHODS: We developed petBrain, a novel end-to-end processing pipeline for amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and structural MRI. It leverages deep learning-based segmentation, standardized biomarker quantification (Centiloid, CenTauR, HAVAs), and simultaneous estimation of A, T2, and N biomarkers. The pipeline is implemented as a web-based platform, requiring no local computational infrastructure or specialized software knowledge.
  RESULTS: petBrain provides reliable and rapid biomarker quantification, with results comparable to existing pipelines for A and T2. It shows strong concordance with data processed in ADNI databases. The staging and quantification of A/T2/N by petBrain demonstrated good agreement with CSF/plasma biomarkers, clinical status, and cognitive performance.
  DISCUSSION: petBrain represents a powerful and openly accessible platform for standardized AD biomarker analysis, facilitating applications in clinical research.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing abnormal findings across multi-plane and whole-body scans-remains a significant challenge in clinical radiology. This work aims to address this challenge through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system, with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On benchmarks, we establish three representative evaluation tasks based on real clinical scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that OminiAbnorm-CT can significantly outperform existing methods on all the tasks and metrics.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing. Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power, cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules, establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures. Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and high-throughput are critical.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.

Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.

Abstract: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior research has focused on visual cues and advanced such fine-grained detection, audio features remain underexplored. In this study, we embed audio cues with visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

<title>Multi-Spectral Gaussian Splatting with Neural Color Representation</title>

Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024, which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization. Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a 3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate (TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Existing facial appearance capture methods can reconstruct plausible facial reflectance from smartphone-recorded videos. However, the reconstruction quality is still far behind the ones based on studio recordings. This paper fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the digital world. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yxuhan/DoRA.

<title>How Far Are We from Predicting Missing Modalities with Foundation Models?</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by at least 10% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ripl/splart.

Abstract: Visually impaired people could benefit from Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret text in their surroundings. However, current models often struggle with recognizing text in the photos taken by this population. Through in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, we identified common framing conventions that frequently result in misaligned text. Existing VQA benchmarks primarily feature well-oriented text captured by sighted users, under-representing these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce ROtated SAmpling (ROSA), a decoding strategy that enhances VQA performance in text-rich images with incorrectly oriented text. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7 absolute points in the best-performing model.

Abstract: Time-resolved CT is an advanced measurement technique that has been widely used to observe dynamic objects, including periodically varying structures such as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches significantly reduce random noise in the reconstructed images without blurring the sharp features of the observed objects. Equivalently, our methods can achieve the same reconstruction quality as gating-based methods but with a lower radiation dose. Our code is available at github.com/PeriodRecon.

Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images. With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative deep learning or large training datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) from R2* maps, but their decision-making remains opaque, raising concerns about interpretability. Previous studies suggest biases in model decisions, necessitating further analysis. This study uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and spectral clustering to explore classifier decision strategies across preprocessing and training configurations using R2* maps. We trained a 3D convolutional neural network on R2* maps, generating relevance heatmaps via LRP and applied spectral clustering to identify dominant patterns. t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization was used to assess clustering structure. Spectral clustering revealed distinct decision patterns, with the relevance-guided model showing the clearest separation between AD and normal control (NC) cases. The t-SNE visualization confirmed that this model aligned heatmap groupings with the underlying subject groups. Our findings highlight the significant impact of preprocessing and training choices on deep learning models trained on R2* maps, even with similar performance metrics. Spectral clustering offers a structured method to identify classification strategy differences, emphasizing the importance of explainability in medical AI.

<title>Rethinking the Stability-Plasticity Trade-off in Continual Learning from an Architectural Perspective</title>

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL. This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability. Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture, tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87% more compact in terms of parameters.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL, prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile solution for PTM-based CL.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However, current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based methods.

<title>DynTok: Dynamic Compression of Visual Tokens for Efficient and Effective Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work, we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance. It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves 65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper, we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity of the modalities.

Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group (RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively "dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly, we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules, akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative models of statistical ensembles in physics.

Abstract: Incidental detection and quantification of coronary calcium in CT scans could lead to the early introduction of lifesaving clinical interventions. However, over-reporting could negatively affect patient wellbeing and unnecessarily burden the medical system. Therefore, careful considerations should be taken when automatically reporting coronary calcium scores. A cluster-based conditional conformal prediction framework is proposed to provide score intervals with calibrated coverage from trained segmentation networks without retraining. The proposed method was tuned and used to calibrate predictive intervals for 3D UNet models (deterministic, MCDropout and deep ensemble) reaching similar coverage with better triage metrics compared to conventional conformal prediction. Meaningful predictive intervals of calcium scores could help triage patients according to the confidence of their risk category prediction.

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training. The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines, this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations aligned with clinical knowledge.

<title>Optimal Transport-based Domain Alignment as a Preprocessing Step for Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04071</link>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability. The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets.

<title>A Diffusion-Driven Temporal Super-Resolution and Spatial Consistency Enhancement Framework for 4D MRI imaging</title>

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has achieved significant performance improvements and holds great promise for future developments. This paper presents a comprehensive study on MIS based on DNNs. Intelligent Vision Systems are often evaluated based on their output levels, such as Data, Information, Knowledge, Intelligence, and Wisdom (DIKIW),and the state-of-the-art solutions in MIS at these levels are the focus of research. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an important research direction, as it aims to uncover the "black box" nature of previous DNN architectures to meet the requirements of transparency and ethics. The study emphasizes the importance of MIS in disease diagnosis and early detection, particularly for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients through timely diagnosis. XAI and early prediction are considered two important steps in the journey from "intelligence" to "wisdom." Additionally, the paper addresses existing challenges and proposes potential solutions to enhance the efficiency of implementing DNN-based MIS.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.

Abstract: Sparse-aspect multi-baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a crucial remote sensing technique. Compared to full-aspect observation, it needs only a few observation aspects to achieve a sufficiently clear 3D scene reconstruction, providing a cost-effective alternative. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR imaging. Recently, deep learning (DL) revolutionizes this field through its powerful data-driven representation capabilities and efficient inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods primarily depend on high-resolution radar images for supervising the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). This unimodal approach precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in imaging performance. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances 3D SAR imaging by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error transfer guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CMAR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse reconstruction algorithms based on CS and DL, with average improvements of 75.83% in PSNR and 47.85% in SSIM. Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for time-consuming full-aperture data preprocessing and relies solely on computer-rendered optical images, significantly reducing dataset construction costs. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.

Abstract: Deception detection has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the significant growth of digital media and heightened ethical and security concerns. It has been extensively studied using multimodal methods, including video, audio, and text. In addition, individual differences in deception production and detection are believed to play a crucial role.Although some studies have utilized individual information such as personality traits to enhance the performance of deception detection, current systems remain limited, partly due to a lack of sufficient datasets for evaluating performance. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal deception dataset MDPE. Besides deception features, this dataset also includes individual differences information in personality and emotional expression characteristics. It can explore the impact of individual differences on deception behavior. It comprises over 104 hours of deception and emotional videos from 193 subjects. Furthermore, we conducted numerous experiments to provide valuable insights for future deception detection research. MDPE not only supports deception detection, but also provides conditions for tasks such as personality recognition and emotion recognition, and can even study the relationships between them. We believe that MDPE will become a valuable resource for promoting research in the field of affective computing.

Abstract: The majority of quantization methods have been proposed to reduce the model size of Vision Transformers, yet most of them have overlooked the quantization of non-linear operations. Only a few works have addressed quantization for non-linear operations, but they applied a single quantization method across all non-linear operations. We believe that this can be further improved by employing a different quantization method for each non-linear operation. Therefore, to assign the most error-minimizing quantization method from the known methods to each non-linear layer, we propose a mixed non-linear quantization that considers layer-wise quantization sensitivity measured by SQNR difference metric. The results show that our method outperforms I-BERT, FQ-ViT, and I-ViT in both 8-bit and 6-bit settings for ViT, DeiT, and Swin models by an average of 0.6%p and 19.6%p, respectively. Our method outperforms I-BERT and I-ViT by 0.6%p and 20.8%p, respectively, when training time is limited. We plan to release our code at https://gitlab.com/ones-ai/mixed-non-linear-quantization.

Abstract: This paper introduces EasyInv, an easy yet novel approach that significantly advances the field of DDIM Inversion by addressing the inherent inefficiencies and performance limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods. At the core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion noise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the inversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates rich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the iterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical aggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current state, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and mitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of delivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the conventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the model's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce. Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding inference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques.

Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

Abstract: Point cloud sequence-based 3D action recognition has achieved impressive performance and efficiency. However, existing point cloud sequence modeling methods cannot adequately balance the precision of limb micro-movements with the integrity of posture macro-structure, leading to the loss of crucial information cues in action inference. To overcome this limitation, we introduce D-Hyperpoint, a novel data type generated through a D-Hyperpoint Embedding module. D-Hyperpoint encapsulates both regional-momentary motion and global-static posture, effectively summarizing the unit human action at each moment. In addition, we present a D-Hyperpoint KANsMixer module, which is recursively applied to nested groupings of D-Hyperpoints to learn the action discrimination information and creatively integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance spatio-temporal interaction within D-Hyperpoints. Finally, we propose KAN-HyperpointNet, a spatio-temporal decoupled network architecture for 3D action recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets: MSR Action3D and NTU-RGB+D 60, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Abstract: Synthesizing anomaly samples has proven to be an effective strategy for self-supervised 2D industrial anomaly detection. However, this approach has been rarely explored in multi-modality anomaly detection, particularly involving 3D and RGB images. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-modality augmentation method for 3D anomaly synthesis, which is simple and capable of mimicking the characteristics of 3D defects. Incorporating with our anomaly synthesis method, we introduce a reconstruction-based discriminative anomaly detection network, in which a dual-modal discriminator is employed to fuse the original and reconstructed embedding of two modalities for anomaly detection. Additionally, we design an augmentation dropout mechanism to enhance the generalizability of the discriminator. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on detection precision and achieves competitive segmentation performance on both MVTec 3D-AD and Eyescandies datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation. However, we have identified that recent methods suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss in an efficient way. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks show that MMAR significantly outperforms most of the existing joint multi-modal models, surpassing the method that employs pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. Meanwhile, MMAR is able to generate high quality images. We also show that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.

<title>Objective drives the consistency of representational similarity across datasets</title>

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis claims that recent foundation models are converging to a shared representation space as a function of their downstream task performance, irrespective of the objectives and data modalities used to train these models (Huh et al., 2024). Representational similarity is generally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent across datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model representations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine learning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational similarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the representations. We find that the objective function is a crucial factor in determining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets. Specifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose relative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another compared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the correspondence between representational similarities and the models' task behavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain datasets. Our work provides a framework for analyzing similarities of model representations across datasets and linking those similarities to differences in task behavior.

<title>Large-Scale Text-to-Image Model with Inpainting is a Zero-Shot Subject-Driven Image Generator</title>

Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to produce images of a new subject within a desired context by accurately capturing both the visual characteristics of the subject and the semantic content of a text prompt. Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject alignment, while recent zero-shot approaches leverage on-the-fly image prompting, often sacrificing subject alignment. In this paper, we introduce Diptych Prompting, a novel zero-shot approach that reinterprets as an inpainting task with precise subject alignment by leveraging the emergent property of diptych generation in large-scale text-to-image models. Diptych Prompting arranges an incomplete diptych with the reference image in the left panel, and performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel. We further prevent unwanted content leakage by removing the background in the reference image and improve fine-grained details in the generated subject by enhancing attention weights between the panels during inpainting. Experimental results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods, resulting in images that are visually preferred by users. Additionally, our method supports not only subject-driven generation but also stylized image generation and subject-driven image editing, demonstrating versatility across diverse image generation applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring transferable 3D representations from unlabeled 3D point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural program. Extensive experiments further suggest that current self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on the semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

Abstract: We address the problem of gaze target estimation, which aims to predict where a person is looking in a scene. Predicting a person's gaze target requires reasoning both about the person's appearance and the contents of the scene. Prior works have developed increasingly complex, hand-crafted pipelines for gaze target estimation that carefully fuse features from separate scene encoders, head encoders, and auxiliary models for signals like depth and pose. Motivated by the success of general-purpose feature extractors on a variety of visual tasks, we propose Gaze-LLE, a novel transformer framework that streamlines gaze target estimation by leveraging features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder. We extract a single feature representation for the scene, and apply a person-specific positional prompt to decode gaze with a lightweight module. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several gaze benchmarks and provide extensive analysis to validate our design choices. Our code is available at: http://github.com/fkryan/gazelle .

Abstract: While unlabeled image data is often plentiful, the costs of high-quality labels pose an important practical challenge: Which images should one select for labeling to use the annotation budget for a particular target task most effectively? To address this problem, we focus on single-pass data selection, which refers to the process of selecting all data to be annotated at once before training a downstream model. Prior methods for single-pass data selection rely on image-level representations and fail to reliably outperform random selection for object detection and segmentation. We propose Object-Focused Data Selection (OFDS) which leverages object-level features from foundation models and ensures semantic coverage of all target classes. In extensive experiments across tasks and target domains, OFDS consistently outperforms random selection and all baselines. The best results for constrained annotation budgets are obtained by combining human labels from OFDS with autolabels from foundation models. Moreover, using OFDS to select the initial labeled set for active learning yields consistent improvements

Abstract: In this paper, we present a contrastive learning based framework, ExeChecker, for the interpretation of rehabilitation exercises. Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.

Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multi-person human mesh recovery (HMR) consists in detecting all individuals in a given input image, and predicting the body shape, pose, and 3D location for each detected person. The dominant approaches to this task rely on neural networks trained to output a single prediction for each detected individual. In contrast, we propose CondiMen, a method that outputs a joint parametric distribution over likely poses, body shapes, intrinsics and distances to the camera, using a Bayesian network. This approach offers several advantages. First, a probability distribution can handle some inherent ambiguities of this task -- such as the uncertainty between a person's size and their distance to the camera, or simply the loss of information when projecting 3D data onto the 2D image plane. Second, the output distribution can be combined with additional information to produce better predictions, by using e.g. known camera or body shape parameters, or by exploiting multi-view observations. Third, one can efficiently extract the most likely predictions from the output distribution, making our proposed approach suitable for real-time applications. Empirically we find that our model i) achieves performance on par with or better than the state-of-the-art, ii) captures uncertainties and correlations inherent in pose estimation and iii) can exploit additional information at test time, such as multi-view consistency or body shape priors. CondiMen spices up the modeling of ambiguity, using just the right ingredients on hand.

Abstract: Diffusion models, particularly latent diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable success in text-driven human motion generation. However, it remains challenging for latent diffusion models to effectively compose multiple semantic concepts into a single, coherent motion sequence. To address this issue, we propose EnergyMoGen, which includes two spectrums of Energy-Based Models: (1) We interpret the diffusion model as a latent-aware energy-based model that generates motions by composing a set of diffusion models in latent space; (2) We introduce a semantic-aware energy model based on cross-attention, which enables semantic composition and adaptive gradient descent for text embeddings. To overcome the challenges of semantic inconsistency and motion distortion across these two spectrums, we introduce Synergistic Energy Fusion. This design allows the motion latent diffusion model to synthesize high-quality, complex motions by combining multiple energy terms corresponding to textual descriptions. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on various motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion generation, compositional motion generation, and multi-concept motion generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to extend motion datasets and improve the text-to-motion task.

Abstract: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Flag manifolds encode nested sequences of subspaces and serve as powerful structures for various computer vision and machine learning applications. Despite their utility in tasks such as dimensionality reduction, motion averaging, and subspace clustering, current applications are often restricted to extracting flags using common matrix decomposition methods like the singular value decomposition. Here, we address the need for a general algorithm to factorize and work with hierarchical datasets. In particular, we propose a novel, flag-based method that decomposes arbitrary hierarchical real-valued data into a hierarchy-preserving flag representation in Stiefel coordinates. Our work harnesses the potential of flag manifolds in applications including denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively researched for large language models in downstream tasks. Among all the existing approaches, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for its streamlined design by incorporating low-rank matrices into existing pre-trained models. Though effective, LoRA, as well as its adaptive optimizations, either allocate the same matrix to all the modules or adjust the interior rank of the components based on importance scoring indicators. In this paper, we argue that not all the modules in LLMs are suitable and necessary to be fine-tuned. Enlightened by this insight, we propose a new PEFT scheme called DiffoRA, which enables adaptive adoption of the low-rank decomposition matrices. At the core of DiffoRA lies a Differential Adaptation Matrix (DAM) to determine which module is the most suitable and essential for fine-tuning. We theoretically explain how the designed matrix impacts the convergence rate and generalization capability of a pre-trained model. We then construct the DAM via continuous relaxation and discretization with weight-sharing optimizations. We fully implement DiffoRA and design comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that DiffoRA delivers state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce a highly multimodal transformer to represent many remote sensing modalities - multispectral optical, synthetic aperture radar, elevation, weather, pseudo-labels, and more - across space and time. These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.

Abstract: Image tokenization has enabled major advances in autoregressive image generation by providing compressed, discrete representations that are more efficient to process than raw pixels. While traditional approaches use 2D grid tokenization, recent methods like TiTok have shown that 1D tokenization can achieve high generation quality by eliminating grid redundancies. However, these methods typically use a fixed number of tokens and thus cannot adapt to an image's inherent complexity. We introduce FlexTok, a tokenizer that projects 2D images into variable-length, ordered 1D token sequences. For example, a 256x256 image can be resampled into anywhere from 1 to 256 discrete tokens, hierarchically and semantically compressing its information. By training a rectified flow model as the decoder and using nested dropout, FlexTok produces plausible reconstructions regardless of the chosen token sequence length. We evaluate our approach in an autoregressive generation setting using a simple GPT-style Transformer. On ImageNet, this approach achieves an FID<2 across 8 to 128 tokens, outperforming TiTok and matching state-of-the-art methods with far fewer tokens. We further extend the model to support to text-conditioned image generation and examine how FlexTok relates to traditional 2D tokenization. A key finding is that FlexTok enables next-token prediction to describe images in a coarse-to-fine "visual vocabulary", and that the number of tokens to generate depends on the complexity of the generation task.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated image (AIGI) models presents new challenges for evaluating image quality, particularly across three aspects: perceptual quality, prompt correspondence, and authenticity. To address these challenges, we introduce M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enable more human-aligned, holistic evaluation of AI-generated images across both visual and textual domains. Besides, our framework features a structured multi-round evaluation process, generating and analyzing intermediate image descriptions to provide deeper insight into these three aspects. By aligning model outputs more closely with human judgment, M3-AGIQA delivers robust and interpretable quality scores. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on tested datasets and aspects, and exhibits strong generalizability in most cross-dataset settings. Code is available at https://github.com/strawhatboy/M3-AGIQA.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) for object detection aims to enhance detectors' performance in unseen scenarios. This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning. Our benchmark and code would be available at \href{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual_modality_role}{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual\_modality\_role}.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that, when trained at scale, uni-modal 2D vision and text encoders converge to learned features that share remarkable structural properties, despite arising from different representations. However, the role of 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored. Furthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are typically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen encoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the possibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from uni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive post-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in limited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding feature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes significantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval tasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared subspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a baseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces, and helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data compared to other representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete representations for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, unified image tokenizers have sparked exploration within research community, which is designed to capture high-level semantic features for understanding and retaining low-level pixel features for generation. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss for semantic distillation and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through a novel semantic-guided hierarchical codebook, which builds pixel sub-codebooks on a pretrained semantic codebook. This design decouples semantic and pixel both in terms of structure and training strategy, enabling the tokenizer to capture pixel features while retaining its ability to comprehend high-level semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves SOTA performance in image reconstruction and multimodal understanding under LLaVA-v1.5 setting. Further, we develop a unified MLLM with SemHiTok, which exhibits superior performance across multimodal understanding and generation tasks. For understanding, SemHiTok achieves impressive performance on most benchmarks. For generation, our model achieves SOTA performance on MJHQ30K in unified MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is crucial for robust video understanding but remains underexplored in existing multimodal benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding. COVER establishes a new standard for assessing MLLMs' logical reasoning abilities in dynamic environments. Our work is available at https://github.com/gongyifan-hash/COVER-Benchmark.

Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.

Abstract: We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively addresses the vanishing advantages dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini. The Skywork R1V2 model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B.

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style information across existing source domains under the data decentralization scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum, ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.

Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings. In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism. The code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/Hunan-Tiger/ReactDiff}{github}.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Abstract: Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) is proposed to adapt a source model to unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. Previous approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.

Abstract: Object orientation understanding represents a fundamental challenge in visual perception critical for applications like robotic manipulation and augmented reality. Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability, often conflating it with positional relationships and general scene understanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning Intelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation perception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of orientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations, relative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding. Through carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories across synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how multi-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the best models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular orientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring reference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the need for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show systematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation changes across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting limitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first diagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in multimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D scene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH), from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

Abstract: Dropout as a common regularizer to prevent overfitting in deep neural networks has been less effective in convolutional layers than in fully connected layers. This is because Dropout drops features randomly, without considering local structure. When features are spatially correlated, as in the case of convolutional layers, information from the dropped features can still propagate to subsequent layers via neighboring features. To address this problem, structured forms of Dropout have been proposed. A drawback of these methods is that they do not adapt to the data. In this work, we leverage the structure in the outputs of convolutional layers and introduce a novel structured regularization method named DropCluster. Our approach clusters features in convolutional layers, and drops the resulting clusters randomly during training iterations. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and APPA-REAL datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective and controls overfitting better than other approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is essential for determining their effectiveness as helpful assistants. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, which provides more nuanced evaluations of alignment capabilities and is the first benchmark specifically designed for Chinese visual contexts. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we develop CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4's evaluation ability. Additionally, we measure the "alignment score", a quantitative metric designed to assess the robustness and stability of models across diverse prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of representative VLMs on AlignMMBench, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of different VLM architectures. The evaluation code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/AlignMMBench.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large models has advanced artificial intelligence, introducing unprecedented levels of performance and functionality. However, optimizing these models remains challenging due to historically isolated paths of model-centric and data-centric developments, leading to suboptimal outcomes and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present a new sandbox suite tailored for integrated data-model co-development. This sandbox provides a feedback-driven experimental platform, enabling cost-effective iteration and guided refinement of both data and models. Our proposed ``Probe-Analyze-Refine'' workflow, validated through practical use cases on multimodal tasks such as image-text pre-training with CLIP, image-to-text generation with LLaVA-like models, and text-to-video generation with DiT-based models, yields transferable and notable performance boosts, such as topping the VBench leaderboard. A comprehensive set of over 100 experiments demonstrated the suite's usability and extensibility, while also uncovering insights into the interplay between data quality, diversity, model behavior, and computational costs. All codes, datasets, and models are open-sourced to foster future research and applications that would otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated co-development infrastructure.

Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.

Abstract: Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.

<title>Rate-In: Information-Driven Adaptive Dropout Rates for Improved Inference-Time Uncertainty Estimation</title>

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for deploying neural networks in risk-sensitive applications such as medical diagnosis. Monte Carlo Dropout is a widely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performing stochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using static dropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertainty estimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individual inputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during training using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that cannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in Monte Carlo simulations.
  In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts dropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by dropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise injection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts dropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth labels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we adaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse medical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical study on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that Rate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to fixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance. Rate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing dropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical applications.

Abstract: IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive capabilities in multimodal systems. To address this crucial gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework, which comprises a large-scale training set with 4,776 visual reasoning problems and 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms. Through systematic evaluation of existing open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (33.17% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal models in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide. Moreover, inspired by the recent surge of large reasoning models, we also release a multimodal reasoning model as the baseline that is trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward functions, reaching competitive performance to the state-of-the-art with a notably smaller model size.

Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed.
  We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score.
  We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).

Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.

Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.

Abstract: Consistency Training (CT) has recently emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion models for image generation. However, non-distillation CT often suffers from high variance and instability, motivating ongoing research into its training dynamics. We propose Variational Consistency Training (VCT), a flexible and effective framework compatible with various forward kernels, including those in flow matching. Its key innovation is a learned noise-data coupling scheme inspired by Variational Autoencoders, where a data-dependent encoder models noise emission. This enables VCT to adaptively learn noise-todata pairings, reducing training variance relative to the fixed, unsorted pairings in classical CT. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate significant improvements: our method surpasses baselines, achieves state-of-the-art FID among non-distillation CT approaches on CIFAR-10, and matches SoTA performance on ImageNet 64 x 64 with only two sampling steps. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/vct.

Abstract: Rapid bone scintigraphy is crucial for diagnosing skeletal disorders and detecting tumor metastases in children, as it shortens scan duration and reduces discomfort. However, accelerated acquisition often degrades image quality, impairing the visibility of fine anatomical details and potentially compromising diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy. Our approach employs two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, supported by three specialized modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules inject domain-specific semantic cues from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM preserves coherent semantic feature representations across both cascaded stages. Moreover, we present RBS, a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset comprising paired standard (20 cm/min) and rapid (40 cm/min) scans from 137 pediatric patients aged 0.5 - 16 years, making it the first dataset tailored for pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy restoration. Extensive experiments on both a public endoscopic dataset and our RBS dataset demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing techniques in PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS metrics.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now firmly at the center of evidence-based medicine. Despite many success stories that edge the path of AI's rise in healthcare, there are comparably many reports of significant shortcomings and unexpected behavior of AI in deployment. A major reason for these limitations is AI's reliance on association-based learning, where non-representative machine learning datasets can amplify latent bias during training and/or hide it during testing. To unlock new tools capable of foreseeing and preventing such AI bias issues, we present G-AUDIT. Generalized Attribute Utility and Detectability-Induced bias Testing (G-AUDIT) for datasets is a modality-agnostic dataset auditing framework that allows for generating targeted hypotheses about sources of bias in training or testing data. Our method examines the relationship between task-level annotations (commonly referred to as ``labels'') and data properties including patient attributes (e.g., age, sex) and environment/acquisition characteristics (e.g., clinical site, imaging protocols). G-AUDIT quantifies the extent to which the observed data attributes pose a risk for shortcut learning, or in the case of testing data, might hide predictions made based on spurious associations. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing large-scale medical datasets for three distinct modalities and machine learning tasks: skin lesion classification in images, stigmatizing language classification in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and mortality prediction for ICU tabular data. In each setting, G-AUDIT successfully identifies subtle biases commonly overlooked by traditional qualitative methods, underscoring its practical value in exposing dataset-level risks and supporting the downstream development of reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Idiomatic expressions present a unique challenge in NLP, as their meanings are often not directly inferable from their constituent words. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.

Abstract: Differentiable vector graphics (VGs) are widely used in image vectorization and vector synthesis, while existing representations are costly to optimize and struggle to achieve high-quality rendering results for high-resolution images. This work introduces a new differentiable VG representation, dubbed B\'ezier Splatting, that enables fast yet high-fidelity VG rasterization. B\'ezier Splatting samples 2D Gaussians along B\'ezier curves, which naturally provide positional gradients at object boundaries. Thanks to the efficient splatting-based differentiable rasterizer, B\'ezier Splatting achieves 30x and 150x faster per forward and backward rasterization step for open curves compared to DiffVG. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive pruning and densification strategy that dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of curves to escape local minima, further improving VG quality. Furthermore, our new VG representation supports conversion to standard XML-based SVG format, enhancing interoperability with existing VG tools and pipelines. Experimental results show that B\'ezier Splatting significantly outperforms existing methods with better visual fidelity and significant optimization speedup.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of glioma, having a 5-year survival rate of 6.9%. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response, radiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to categorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical features: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep learning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work aimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO criteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and tested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction of input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model architectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The pipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96% was achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency Maps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast, Grad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions observed in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it effectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for future studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO criteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role when assessing the tumor's response to treatment.

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+ images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking. Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to 1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, the explosive advancement of deepfake technology has posed a critical and escalating threat to public security: diffusion-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.

Abstract: Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information, crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.

Summary: 
InfoSAM introduces an information-theoretic approach to enhance the fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by distilling and preserving its pre-trained segmentation knowledge. The proposed approach focuses on two mutual information-based objectives: compressing domain-invariant relations from pre-trained SAM and maximizing mutual information between the teacher (pre-trained SAM) and the student (fine-tuned model). This framework establishes a robust distillation process for SAM's parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm InfoSAM's effectiveness in improving performance in specialized scenarios and real-world tasks, showcasing its adaptability and superiority within the SAM family. <div>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model, exhibits impressive zero-shot capabilities in general tasks but struggles in specialized domains. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a promising approach to unleash the potential of SAM in novel scenarios. However, existing PEFT methods for SAM neglect the domain-invariant relations encoded in the pre-trained model. To bridge this gap, we propose InfoSAM, an information-theoretic approach that enhances SAM fine-tuning by distilling and preserving its pre-trained segmentation knowledge. Specifically, we formulate the knowledge transfer process as two novel mutual information-based objectives: (i) to compress the domain-invariant relation extracted from pre-trained SAM, excluding pseudo-invariant information as possible, and (ii) to maximize mutual information between the relational knowledge learned by the teacher (pre-trained SAM) and the student (fine-tuned model). The proposed InfoSAM establishes a robust distillation framework for PEFT of SAM. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate InfoSAM's effectiveness in improving SAM family's performance on real-world tasks, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in handling specialized scenarios.

<div> Keywords: continual visual instruction tuning, online sample selection, adaptive sampling, multi-modal data, real-time adaptation

Summary: 
OASIS is a new adaptive online sample selection approach for continual visual instruction tuning scenarios, where multi-modal data arrives in an online streaming manner. It dynamically adjusts the selected samples per batch based on inter-batch informativeness and minimizes redundancy through iterative selection score updates. This approach addresses training delays from large-scale data and the unknown future data in CVIT setups. Empirical results show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data training using only 25% of the data, outperforming existing methods. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across various MLLMs such as LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-VL-2.5. <div>

Abstract: In continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) scenarios, where multi-modal data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. While existing data selection strategies reduce training overheads, they rely on pre-trained reference models, which are impractical in CVIT setups due to unknown future data. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this issue but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k), causing them to suffer from distribution shifts where informativeness varies across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive online sample selection approach for CVIT that: (1) dynamically adjusts selected samples per batch based on relative inter-batch informativeness, and (2) minimizes redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score updates. Empirical results across various MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-VL-2.5, show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data training using only 25% of the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Summary:<br /><br />Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) technology transcribes speech by analyzing lip movements. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into VSR systems has shown significant performance improvements. This study delves into optimizing the utilization of LLMs in VSR tasks through three key contributions. Firstly, a scaling test reveals the impact of LLM size on VSR performance, highlighting a scaling law. Secondly, incorporating contextual text for guiding LLM decoding enhances recognition accuracy. Lastly, the proposed iterative polishing technique refines LLM outputs progressively to reduce recognition errors. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that these strategies effectively harness the potential of LLMs and result in substantial enhancements in VSR performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs, the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant VSR performance improvement.

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios. Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge. However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle, enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

Summary:  
The article introduces a new Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework for text-to-image generation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs have shown improvements in image understanding and generation but struggle with fine-grained visual comprehension. OSPO leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs without external datasets or models by focusing on high-quality preference pair data. It autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through object-centric prompt perturbation, densification, and VQA scoring to improve preference optimization. This process eliminates ambiguous variations in generated preference pairs, enhancing optimization effectiveness. Validated on three compositional text-to-image benchmarks, OSPO outperforms baseline models significantly, showcasing its potential in enhancing text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved both image understanding and generation capabilities. Despite these improvements, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual comprehension, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks. While preference optimization methods have been explored to address these limitations in image understanding tasks, their application to image generation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework designed for text-to-image generation by MLLMs. OSPO leverages the intrinsic reasoning abilities of MLLMs without requiring any external datasets or models. OSPO emphasizes the importance of high-quality preference pair data, which is critical for effective preference optimization. To achieve this, it introduces a self-improving mechanism that autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through object-centric prompt perturbation, densification and VQA scoring. This process eliminates ambiguous or disproportionate variations commonly found in naively generated preference pairs, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of preference optimization. We validate OSPO on three representative compositional text-to-image benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains over baseline models.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method for improving adversarial robustness in DNNs by leveraging layer-wise features to construct feature paths and computing correlations between example feature paths and class-centered feature paths. Experimental results on ResNet-20 and ResNet-18 models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a trade-off between clean and adversarial accuracy without relying on computationally intensive defense strategies. Specifically, the method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial accuracy on ResNet-20, outperforming adversarial training. On ResNet-18, similar advantages are observed with respective metrics of 80.01% clean accuracy and 46.1% adversarial accuracy. These results suggest that DNNs may possess inherent adversarial robustness, challenging the conventional belief of their weak adversarial robustness. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies. Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

<div> keywords: Automatic Gender Recognition, gender classification, non-binary, fairness, feedback mechanism

Summary:
Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems often classify individuals based on observable features correlated with male or female sex, leading to unreliable results for non-binary and gender non-conforming people. The article suggests a rethinking of AGR systems by emphasizing the distinction between sex, gender, and gender expression. It proposes enabling users to correct the system's output, similar to human-human interactions where misgendering can be re-evaluated and corrected. Despite concerns about diminishing system autonomy, implementing a feedback mechanism in AGR can significantly increase fairness levels and respect individuals' rights and self-expression. This conceptual shift advocates for AGR tools that prioritize individuals' autonomy and self-determination in gender identification.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread application in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are typically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based on observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In addition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of view, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between the categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto which their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender cannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR tools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender non-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR systems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender expression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic misgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of re-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be recreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output. While implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing the system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness levels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that we advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting individuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal embeddings, contrastive learning, hard negative mining, gradient analysis, explicit gradient amplifier

Summary:
In recent years, there has been significant progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like CLIP, which offer powerful multi-modal embeddings. However, the core contrastive learning paradigm in MLLMs has remained unchanged, with the effective mining of hard negative samples being crucial for performance improvement. This study analyzes the gradients of the info-NCE loss concerning query, positive, and negative samples, shedding light on the significance of hard negatives in model parameter updates. A novel approach, the Explicit Gradient Amplifier, is proposed to amplify gradients related to hard negative samples, promoting the learning of more discriminative embeddings. The model, based on LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods. Additionally, when integrated with the QQMM MLLM, the approach achieves the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. All code and models are publicly available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model, trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone. Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on https://github.com/QQ-MM/QQMM-embed.

<div> Keywords: dataset distillation, video datasets, redundancy reduction, temporal resolution, reinforcement learning

Summary:
Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD) is introduced as a novel approach for reducing redundancy in video datasets by optimizing the temporal resolution based on video semantics. Existing dataset distillation methods do not effectively handle the varying levels of temporal redundancy present in different video semantics, limiting their performance on video datasets. DAViD utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach with a teacher-in-the-loop reward function to predict the optimal temporal resolution of synthetic videos. This adaptive approach outperforms existing methods, improving performance significantly. By introducing semantic-aware video dataset distillation, DAViD showcases the potential for more efficient and effective distillation techniques in the future. This work opens up new possibilities for research in the field of video dataset distillation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However, while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

<div> benchmark, multimodal large language models, visual perception errors, human accuracy, task complexity

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in reasoning but struggle with visual perception. A new benchmark dataset, "Do You See Me", evaluates MLLM visual skills across seven human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D. Findings show a stark performance gap between MLLMs and humans, with MLLMs averaging below 50% accuracy while humans achieve 96.49%. This performance deficit increases with task complexity, indicating challenges such as misallocated visual attention and unstable internal representations. The study emphasizes the need for MLLMs with robust visual perception to enhance reasoning capabilities. The dataset, source code, and evaluation scripts are available for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show reasoning promise, yet their visual perception is a critical bottleneck. Strikingly, MLLMs can produce correct answers even while misinterpreting crucial visual elements, masking these underlying failures. Our preliminary study on a joint perception-reasoning dataset revealed that for one leading MLLM, 29% of its correct answers to reasoning questions still exhibited visual perception errors. To systematically address this, we introduce "Do You See Me", a scalable benchmark with 1,758 images and 2,612 questions. It spans seven human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D, featuring controllable complexity to rigorously evaluate MLLM visual skills. Our findings on 3 leading closed-source and 5 major open-source models reveal a stark deficit: humans achieve 96.49% accuracy, while top MLLMs average below 50%. This performance gap widens rapidly with increased task complexity (e.g., from 12% to 45% in the visual form constancy subtask). Further analysis into the root causes suggests that failures stem from challenges like misallocated visual attention and the instability of internal representations for fine-grained details, especially at or below encoder patch resolution. This underscores an urgent need for MLLMs with truly robust visual perception. The benchmark dataset, source code and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Do-You-See-Me.

Summary:
This article proposes a novel approach for learning alignment between language and vision by leveraging cycle consistency as a supervisory signal, eliminating the need for costly human or AI preferences. By mapping text back to image space and measuring similarity between the original image and its reconstruction, as well as textual similarity between input captions and their reconstructions, the authors construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison pairs. The reward model trained on this dataset outperforms existing alignment metrics on detailed captioning tasks and is more scalable during inference. Additionally, the dataset improves performance in vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation using DPO and Diffusion DPO. The dataset, model, and code are available online for further research and experimentation.

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge, especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex. Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text, we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore, performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation.

Summary: 
SAB3R introduces the new task of Map and Locate, merging object segmentation and 3D reconstruction. The objective is to generate point clouds from unposed videos and segment object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task bridges reconstruction, recognition, and reorganization, crucial for real-world embodied AI applications. SAB3R, a novel baseline method, improves upon previous techniques by incorporating a distillation strategy that transfers dense semantic features from 2D vision backbones like CLIP and DINOv2 to enhance 3D reconstruction capabilities. By generating per-pixel semantic features and constructing cohesive point maps in a single pass without additional networks, SAB3R outperforms separate implementations of MASt3R and CLIP on the Map and Locate benchmark. The model is evaluated on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across various applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

<div> Deformable medical image registration, computer-assisted interventions, oncological treatments, AI methods, implicit registration


Summary:
Deformable medical image registration is crucial for oncological treatments, requiring precise image alignment to track tumor growth and assess treatment response. Traditional techniques are surpassed in accuracy and speed by AI methods but often produce unreliable deformations. A novel implicit registration framework is introduced in this work, reformulating image registration as a signal reconstruction problem. By learning a kernel function to recover dense displacement fields from sparse keypoint correspondences, accurate and reliable deformations can be predicted. The hierarchical architecture of the method allows for efficient refinement at test time, enabling clinicians to adjust registrations easily. Validated on challenging intra-patient tasks, the method demonstrates competitive accuracy, bridges the gap between implicit and explicit registration techniques, and generates deformations preserving anatomical relationships. Its performance matches that of specialized commercial systems, indicating potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper, we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100 high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
- The study compares brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification.
- A new approach using decision variable correlation (DVC) was proposed to measure the similarity of decision strategies.
- Model--model similarity is similar to monkey--monkey similarity, while model--monkey similarity is lower and decreases with higher ImageNet-1k performance.
- Adversarial training improves model--model similarity but does not impact model--monkey similarity.
- Pre-training on larger datasets also does not enhance model--monkey similarity, indicating a difference in task-relevant representations between monkey V4/IT and models trained on image classification tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and, surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical - scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year, tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval (TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see, but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty.

This paper introduces Diff2Flow, a framework that enhances the transfer of knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to flow matching tasks. By rescaling timesteps, aligning interpolants, and deriving flow matching-compatible velocity fields from diffusion predictions, Diff2Flow enables efficient and direct flow matching finetuning of diffusion priors without additional computation overhead. Experiment results show that Diff2Flow outperforms naive flow matching and diffusion finetuning, especially under parameter-efficient constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps, aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However, current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion, resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and physics-based motion models.

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations, enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP, surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

The article introduces Rig3R, a model for estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs in embodied AI applications like autonomous driving. Rig3R incorporates rig structure when available and learns to infer it when not, using optional rig metadata and developing a rig-aware latent space. It predicts pointmaps, pose raymaps relative to a global frame, and rig raymaps relative to a rig-centric frame across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure from input images without metadata. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, surpassing traditional and learned methods with a 17-45% mAA improvement across real-world rig datasets in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new benchmark for mixed-modal image retrieval, addressing the need for deep cross-modal contextual understanding. The benchmark includes two challenging query types - single entity-image queries and multi-entity-image queries. Two datasets are presented: the Entity Image Dataset, containing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset, derived from the WIT dataset. These datasets are validated empirically and through crowd-sourced human annotations. The benchmark serves as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The datasets are accessible through the GitHub page: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit-retrieval.

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

Summary:
The article introduces the Medical World Model (MeWM), a novel world model in medicine that predicts future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises vision-language models as policy models and tumor generative models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or regression under treatment conditions. An inverse dynamics model applies survival analysis to evaluate treatment efficacy and select optimal clinical action plans. MeWM simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with high specificity validated by radiologists. The inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs in optimizing individualized treatment protocols. MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, enhancing the selection of optimal treatment protocols.

Abstract: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i) vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists. Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably, MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, boosting F1-score in selecting the optimal TACE protocol by 13%, paving the way for future integration of medical world models as the second readers.

<div> Keywords: Generalized Category Discovery, Reciprocal Learning Framework, Class-wise Distribution Regularization, parametric-based approaches, unlabeled samples

Summary:
Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) is introduced in the context of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) to improve base discrimination in parametric-based methods. It incorporates an auxiliary branch for base classification during training, improving the reliability of self-supervision. The auxiliary branch provides more reliable soft labels to the main branch, creating a virtuous cycle that enhances performance. Class-wise Distribution Regularization (CDR) is implemented to mitigate bias towards base classes and increase prediction confidence of unlabeled data, improving performance with novel classes. The proposed method, RLCD, combines RLF and CDR to achieve superior performance across all classes with minimal additional computation. Extensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate the effectiveness of RLCD. The codes for RLCD are publicly available for reference and use. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of 31.3% on the HM3D dataset. And on the more challenging MP3D dataset, RATE-Nav shows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.

Summary:
Referring video object segmentation aims to segment objects in a video based on natural language expressions. Existing approaches mostly focus on localizing a single target object, overlooking interactions with other entities. The InterRVOS task introduced in this work involves segmenting both actor and target entities in interactions, described by complementary expressions. A large-scale dataset, InterRVOS-8K, with diverse interaction-aware expressions, is introduced, along with a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, achieving strong performance. An actor-target-aware evaluation setting enables targeted assessment of interaction understanding. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling complex object interactions for referring video object segmentation, laying the groundwork for future research in interaction-centric video understanding. The project page for InterRVOS is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/InterRVOS.

<br /><br />Summary: Referring video object segmentation is extended to include interactions between actor and target entities, with the introduction of the InterRVOS task and dataset. A baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, achieves strong performance, and an actor-target-aware evaluation setting enables focused assessment of interaction understanding. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods in modeling complex object interactions, paving the way for further exploration in interaction-centric video understanding. <div>
arXiv:2506.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for future research in interaction-centric video understanding.

<div> fine-grained classification, pavement types, road surface classification, autonomous driving, vision-based

Summary:
Road surface classification (RSC) is crucial for enhancing road safety and traffic management, especially in autonomous driving scenarios. Current visual methods lack fine-grained classification of pavement types. A novel vision-based RSC method called RoadFormer integrates local and global features using convolutional and transformer modules. The approach includes a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) to extract fine-grained context features, overcoming intra-class differences and enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results on large and simplified datasets show Top-1 accuracies of 92.52% and 96.50%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 5.69% to 12.84%. RoadFormer significantly improves pavement perception reliability in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and 96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods. These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement perception in autonomous driving systems.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to training object detection models without the need for ground truth labels. By utilizing vision-language foundation models to generate pseudo "ground truth" labels, the traditional labeling costs are circumvented. This method allows for the training of lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient, reducing labeling time and costs significantly. The approach was tested across various labeling configurations, inference models, and datasets, establishing it as a viable alternative to standard labeling. The results show competitive performance on multiple datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of this auto-labeling methodology in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2506.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore, alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results, we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially reduces labeling time and costs.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) for denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) degraded by mixed noise. The DU-TRPCA alternates between low-rank and sparse modules, inspired by tensor robust principal component analysis. The low-rank module uses thresholded tensor singular value decomposition for global spatial-spectral structure capture, while the sparse module removes localized outliers and complex noise. This tightly integrated architecture enhances representational capacity through attention mechanisms, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in denoising under severe mixed noise. The approach offers interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by iterative optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs validate the effectiveness of DU-TRPCA, emphasizing its potential for practical applications. The code is available for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules, resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules: low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by iterative optimization.

<div> Keywords: Data sampling, classifier efficiency, granular-ball method, approximate borderline sampling, class noise datasets

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new data sampling method for classification tasks, called approximate borderline sampling using granular-balls (GBABS). This method addresses limitations of existing sampling methods by preventing overlap between granular-balls through a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method. GBABS also incorporates the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbor to handle both borderline sampling and improve the quality of class noise datasets. By focusing on borderline samples and incorporating noise detection, GBABS achieves superior performance on noisy datasets without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results show that GBABS outperforms existing GB-based sampling methods and other representative sampling techniques. The source code for GBABS is publicly available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets. Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new architecture, ViTNF, for generalized category discovery (GCD) that replaces the MLP head in ViT with a neural field-based classifier. The proposed classifier consists of two coupled static neural fields that store feature information of support samples and known categories. By pre-training the feature extractor and training the NF classifier separately, ViTNF reduces the demand for training samples and model training complexity. Additionally, an algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field enhances the model's ability to identify new categories. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard Cars datasets show significant accuracy improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in both new and all classes, highlighting ViTNF's advantage in GCD. <div>
arXiv:2506.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data. By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process, increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made, traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action Anticipation (m\&amp;m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

<div> Keywords: Infrared small target detection, recurrent reusable-convolution attention network, reusable-convolution block, dual interactive attention aggregation module, DpT-k loss <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new method, RRCA-Net, for infrared small target detection. It addresses the challenges of detecting small, dim, and shapeless targets by using a recurrent reusable-convolution block (RuCB) and a dual interactive attention aggregation module (DIAAM). The RuCB helps maintain and refine high-level information of small targets in deep layers, while the DIAAM promotes the fusion of refined information. Additionally, a target characteristic-inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) is designed to ensure steady convergence. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that RRCA-Net achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and can be used as a plug-and-play module to improve the performance of existing methods. The code for RRCA-Net will be available on GitHub soon. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network (RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence, we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/ soon.

Summary:
The research addresses the challenge of converting nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness, which has not been extensively studied. The Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND) framework is introduced to overcome limitations in existing methods. The framework includes a data synthesis pipeline that enforces brightness consistency and a restoration model integrating a pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This approach enables efficient night-to-day brightness mapping and realistic lighting reconstruction. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and model in joint haze removal and brightness mapping. <div>

Abstract: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND) framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze removal and brightness mapping.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by LiDAR semantic segmentation models in adverse weather conditions and proposes a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC) framework to address these issues. The GRC framework separates feature extraction for geometry and reflectance, utilizing a dual-branch architecture and multi-level feature collaboration module to enhance robustness and generalization. By effectively extracting intrinsic scene information while suppressing interference, the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in adverse weather conditions without the need for complex simulations or augmentations. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks validate the superiority of the GRC framework, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR semantic segmentation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC) framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new state-of-the-art results.

Summary:
The paper introduces the concept of "Modelship Attribution" to trace the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. It presents a novel method, the modelship attribution transformer (MAT), designed to effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. To simulate real-world scenarios, the authors utilize three generative models to create the first modelship dataset comprising 83,700 images. The focus is on characterizing each model's distinctive editing patterns rather than extracting blended fingerprints, as later edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models. Extensive experiments and comparative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for modelship attribution. Ablation studies further support the findings, promising a solution for tracing complex iterative manipulations in authentic visuals. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging. Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models, StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

Summary: 
Pre-trained encoders followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) have improved cancer diagnosis in pathology. However, the lack of fine-tuning and disjoint optimization hinders performance. To address this, the paper introduces an end-to-end (E2E) learning approach called ABMILX that optimizes sparse-attention MIL. By incorporating global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms, ABMILX enhances performance. Additionally, efficient multi-scale random patch sampling improves computational efficiency. Through E2E training with ABMILX, the model surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on challenging benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. This highlights the potential of E2E learning in computational pathology and emphasizes the need for further research in this area.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is https://github.com/DearCaat/E2E-WSI-ABMILX.

<div> Diffusion models, medical image registration, semantic correspondences, deformable image registration networks, feature extraction <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of diffusion models, originally trained for image generation, as feature extractors for identifying semantic correspondences in medical images. The researchers propose using diffusion model features as a similarity measure to improve deformable image registration networks. Traditional intensity-based similarity losses are shown to be less effective in challenging scenarios where certain anatomies are present in one image but not in another, resulting in inaccurate alignments. By leveraging semantic correspondences, the proposed method aligns meaningful structures across images, leading to more accurate registrations. The approach is validated on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted MRI), demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. The code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images. Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted MRI).

Abstract: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups. Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI decoding models.

The paper introduces a framework called Video-Level Language-Driven VVI-ReID (VLD) for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification. It addresses the challenge of matching pedestrian sequences across different modalities by leveraging language prompts. The framework consists of two core modules: Invariant-Modality Language Prompting (IMLP) and Spatial-Temporal Prompting (STP). IMLP generates modality-shared text prompts aligned with visual features, mitigating modality differences. STP incorporates spatiotemporal information using the Spatial-Temporal Hub (STH) and Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (STA) submodules. STH aggregates spatiotemporal information into the ViT layers, while STA focuses on identity-relevant feature aggregation. The VLD framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach in addressing modality gaps in person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework, video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules: invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting (STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space, thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub (STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

This article introduces a novel framework for Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints. Current approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. The proposed method synchronously generates HOI videos and motion by integrating visual appearance and motion patterns. It implements tri-modal adaptive modulation and 3D full-attention for feature aligning and modeling dependencies. A vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model generates explicit 3D interaction sequences, enhancing video-motion consistency without predefined object models.

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

The article introduces ANT, an Adaptive Neural Temporal-Aware architecture inspired by biological morphogenesis. ANT addresses the temporal-frequency demands of text-to-motion generation by incorporating three key components. Firstly, the Semantic Temporally Adaptive Module automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement. Secondly, the Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio for improved efficiency and fidelity. Finally, Temporal-semantic reweighting aligns text influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT enhances model performance across various baselines and achieves state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion. <div>

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) focuses on adapting pre-trained models during inference to changing environments. This paper explores the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights, specifically the magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. The pairwise angular structure is found to be stable across different domains, preserving domain-invariant semantic information. PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition) is proposed as a CTTA method that decomposes weights into magnitude and direction, introducing a learnable orthogonal matrix to globally rotate direction while maintaining pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only magnitudes and orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on four CTTA benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of preserving pairwise angular structure in adaptation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks, demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet effective principle for CTTA.

<div> scene synthesis, editing, 3D indoor scenes, autoregressive language models, object addition<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces ReSpace, a new generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Current approaches for 3D indoor scenes have limitations such as oversimplifying object semantics or ignoring room boundaries. ReSpace addresses these challenges by providing a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries, allowing for more accurate scene editing. The framework utilizes a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment to train a language model for object addition. Experimental results show that ReSpace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in object addition while maintaining competitive results in full scene synthesis. Additionally, a novel voxelization-based evaluation method is introduced to capture fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. <div>

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on full scene synthesis.

<div> Keywords: Continual test-time adaptive object detection, computational efficiency, sensitivity-guided channel pruning, sparsity regularization, stochastic channel reactivation

Summary:  
Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) methods typically focus on effectiveness but overlook computational efficiency. This paper proposes an efficient CTTA-OD method through pruning, which identifies and eliminates domain-sensitive feature channels to focus adaptation efforts on important ones. A sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies, and weighted sparsity regularization is applied to suppress and prune sensitive channels. A stochastic channel reactivation mechanism is introduced to restore pruned channels, mitigating the risk of early pruning. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in adaptation performance while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs. <div>

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent SOTA method.

Abstract: Stroke rehabilitation often demands precise tracking of patient movements to monitor progress, with complexities of rehabilitation exercises presenting two critical challenges: fine-grained and sub-second (under one-second) action detection. In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer (HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained), sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general datasets, achieving Edit Score (ES) of 70.1 on StrokeRehab Video, 69.4 on StrokeRehab IMU, and 88.4 on 50Salads.

<div> shape, material, object, image, perception

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel conditional denoising-diffusion model for perceiving shape and material of objects from a single image. Inspired by human behavior, the model generates shape-and-material maps from short videos of objects undergoing differential motions. Using a parameter-efficient architecture trained directly in pixel-space, the model disentangles shape and material attributes simultaneously. Trained on synthetic object-motion videos with supervision, the model produces diverse, multimodal shape-and-material predictions for static observations and converges quickly to accurate explanations for moving objects. It also generates high-quality estimates for real-world objects. By incorporating continuous motion observations, this work suggests a generative perception approach to enhance visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained. Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

<title>Towards Better De-raining Generalization via Rainy Characteristics Memorization and Replay</title>

arXiv:2506.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset, leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data, mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning. Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

<title>Flexiffusion: Training-Free Segment-Wise Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02488</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark, comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image encoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding module to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments across multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction accuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/jcliu0428/ZeroPlane.

Abstract: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances, synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However, both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models (LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end, we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in generation quality and overall editing performance.

<title>Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Weak Supervision from Imperfect Labels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks, including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels, domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration, we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m). The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated through ablation studies. Code is available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/weakim2h.

<title>MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis, enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.

Abstract: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis, and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database, SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants: SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Qwen2.5-Max).

Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder, downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

<title>DCI: Dual-Conditional Inversion for Boosting Diffusion-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing, and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks, significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

<title>Contrast &amp; Compress: Learning Lightweight Embeddings for Short Trajectories</title>

Abstract: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

<title>BEVCALIB: LiDAR-Camera Calibration via Geometry-Guided Bird's-Eye View Representations</title>

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation, rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best reproducible baseline by one order of magnitude. Our code and demo results are available at https://cisl.ucr.edu/BEVCalib.

<title>Hyperspectral Image Generation with Unmixing Guided Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

Abstract: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types. There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.

<title>One-Step Diffusion-based Real-World Image Super-Resolution with Visual Perception Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02605</link>

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model. Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

<title>Hierarchical Question-Answering for Driving Scene Understanding Using Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree, where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g., "Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent, contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover, qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of iris image synthesis methods, which can alleviate the issues associated with gathering large, diverse datasets of biometric data from living individuals, which are considered pivotal for biometric methods development. These methods for synthesizing iris data range from traditional, hand crafted image processing-based techniques, through various iterations of GAN-based image generators, variational autoencoders (VAEs), as well as diffusion models. The potential and fidelity in iris image generation of each method is discussed and examples of inferred predictions are provided. Furthermore, the risks of individual biometric features leakage from the training sets are considered, together with possible strategies for preventing them, which have to be implemented should these generative methods be considered a valid replacement of real-world biometric datasets.

Abstract: This paper proposes ControlMambaIR, a novel image restoration method designed to address perceptual challenges in image deraining, deblurring, and denoising tasks. By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.

<title>Small Aid, Big Leap: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models with AdaptNet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation. To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial intelligence, with profound applications in education, computer-aided design, and computational graphics. Despite its significance, automating GPS remains challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable breakthroughs, particularly for SAT-level problems, yet the field remains fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing, and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm, assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this, we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.

arXiv:2506.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840 on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness. These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative orientation for MER.

Abstract: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge, adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions. Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model, enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications. Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

<title>ToothForge: Automatic Dental Shape Generation using Synchronized Spectral Embeddings</title>

Abstract: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets. By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore, synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods, which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes from various clinics is unrealistic.

Abstract: Image scoring is a crucial task in numerous real-world applications. To trust a model's judgment, understanding its rationale is essential. This paper proposes a novel training method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate not only image scores but also corresponding justifications in natural language. Leveraging only an image scoring dataset and an instruction-tuned VLM, our method enables self-training, utilizing the VLM's generated text without relying on external data or models. In addition, we introduce a simple method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Abstract: Existing optical flow datasets focus primarily on real-world simulation or synthetic human motion, but few are tailored to Celluloid(cel) anime character motion: a domain with unique visual and motion characteristics. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

Abstract: Compound figures, which are multi-panel composites containing diverse subfigures, are ubiquitous in biomedical literature, yet large-scale subfigure extraction remains largely unaddressed. Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.

<title>VTGaussian-SLAM: RGBD SLAM for Large Scale Scenes with Splatting View-Tied 3D Gaussians</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02741</link>

arXiv:2506.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering. However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied 3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels, without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances. Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability.

<title>RobustSplat: Decoupling Densification and Dynamics for Transient-Free 3DGS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation, allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS) metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths. This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and 31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection. Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/DTNet.

Abstract: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically, FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation. Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene, graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and controllability in a range of applications.

Abstract: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing potential for clinical application.

<title>Random Registers for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises (i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition. This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/shuaiyi308/REAP.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets are limited to Earth's gravitational conditions. However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts. We establish baselines using state-of-the-art models. All data, annotations, and code are available at https://github.com/LEI-QI-233/HAR-in-Space.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR) texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images, and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input. PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes, outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

<title>Learning Pyramid-structured Long-range Dependencies for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

arXiv:2506.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques, generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption, but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics. Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime scenarios. Dataset and Source Code can be accessed here "https://github.com/AhsanBaidar/MVTD".

Abstract: Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter satellite imagery is increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications.

<title>GaRA-SAM: Robustifying Segment Anything Model with Gated-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module. This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM, significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC, a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in automatic facial behavior analysis systems from computing communities such as vision, multimodal interaction, robotics, and affective computing. Building upon the widespread utility of prior open-source facial analysis systems, we introduce OpenFace 3.0, an open-source toolkit capable of facial landmark detection, facial action unit detection, eye-gaze estimation, and facial emotion recognition. OpenFace 3.0 contributes a lightweight unified model for facial analysis, trained with a multi-task architecture across diverse populations, head poses, lighting conditions, video resolutions, and facial analysis tasks. By leveraging the benefits of parameter sharing through a unified model and training paradigm, OpenFace 3.0 exhibits improvements in prediction performance, inference speed, and memory efficiency over similar toolkits and rivals state-of-the-art models. OpenFace 3.0 can be installed and run with a single line of code and operate in real-time without specialized hardware. OpenFace 3.0 code for training models and running the system is freely available for research purposes and supports contributions from the community.

<title>Dense Match Summarization for Faster Two-view Estimation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense matchers.

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

<title>Towards Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines: A Benchmark through 3D LiDAR Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02914</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide: Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines, eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2) projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid. Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem, underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

<title>MIND: Material Interface Generation from UDFs for Non-Manifold Surface Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images, extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases. To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources, including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD, the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies, setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Abstract: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research. However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i) broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12 state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose \textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/DFBench.

Abstract: BlackSky introduces Smartflow, a cloud-based framework enabling scalable spatiotemporal geospatial research built on open-source tools and technologies. Using STAC-compliant catalogs as a common input, heterogeneous geospatial data can be processed into standardized datacubes for analysis and model training. Model experimentation is managed using a combination of tools, including ClearML, Tensorboard, and Apache Superset. Underpinning Smartflow is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the provisioning and execution of workflows to support both horizontal and vertical scalability. This combination of features makes Smartflow well-suited for geospatial model development and analysis over large geographic areas, time scales, and expansive image archives.
  We also present a novel neural architecture, built using Smartflow, to monitor large geographic areas for heavy construction. Qualitative results based on data from the IARPA Space-based Machine Automated Recognition Technique (SMART) program are presented that show the model is capable of detecting heavy construction throughout all major phases of development.

<title>Sparse-vDiT: Unleashing the Power of Sparse Attention to Accelerate Video Diffusion Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.

Abstract: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

Abstract: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts. However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across various datasets and sub-tasks. Demo, Code and Model: https://orangesodahub.github.io/ORV

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons, accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However, conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos. Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare intra-operative irregularities.

Abstract: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work, we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding. Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to baselines on unimodal tasks.

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast optimization and efficient memory usage.

arXiv:2506.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Editing images with instructions to reflect non-rigid motions, camera viewpoint shifts, object deformations, human articulations, and complex interactions, poses a challenging yet underexplored problem in computer vision. Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.

<title>Revisiting Continuity of Image Tokens for Cross-domain Few-shot Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data, which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens, encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/shuaiyi308/ReCIT.

Abstract: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate, the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts. Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress. We make our code available at: https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/tree-detection-framework.

<title>Targeted Forgetting of Image Subgroups in CLIP Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples, and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

Abstract: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate that our PoseFuse3D model improves interpolation fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene, characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot. Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536) and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8 task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels. Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials (including all data and code) are available at https://zju-real.github.io/SVGenius.

Abstract: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos. Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method, we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms of both camera controllability and visual quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

arXiv:2506.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's abstract reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large, annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification, segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal compact representation better disentangles features from different structural parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: Previous works in the literature apply 3D spatial-only models on 4D functional MRI data leading to possible sub-par feature extraction to be used for downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we aim to develop a novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal dynamics. Experimental results show promising performance in capturing spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model improves Alzheimers disease diagnosis for rs-fMRI data, enabling earlier detection and better interventions. Future research could explore task-based fMRI applications and regression tasks, enhancing understanding of cognitive performance and disease progression.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an additional network that generates the weights of the primary network dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in enabling continual learning for improved performance.

<title>Robust Federated Learning against Noisy Clients via Masked Optimization</title>

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are available via https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim .

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels. Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures. CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical, implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for intestines, and +36% for vessels.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable, challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning patterns.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the applicability of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide framework to Artificial Intelligence (AI) software projects, highlighting key limitations and proposing tailored adaptations. Unlike traditional projects, AI initiatives rely heavily on complex data, iterative experimentation, and specialized expertise while navigating significant ethical considerations. Our analysis identifies gaps in the PMBOK Guide, including its limited focus on data management, insufficient support for iterative development, and lack of guidance on ethical and multidisciplinary challenges. To address these deficiencies, we recommend integrating data lifecycle management, adopting iterative and AI project management frameworks, and embedding ethical considerations within project planning and execution. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches that better align with AI's dynamic and exploratory nature. We aim to enhance project management practices for AI software projects by bridging these gaps.

<title>Dual encoding feature filtering generalized attention UNET for retinal vessel segmentation</title>

Abstract: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist, hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization. Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets (DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models. Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods in cross-validation model generalization.

Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.

Abstract: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the $\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes, while employing far fewer network parameters.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and diagnostic value.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies. Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task, and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper, we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data. However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses. We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles. High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$ score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/HiLO .

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping depends heavily on representative and timely sample data. However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution. Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring high-quality images. Its code can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/TSRNet.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.

Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore, inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter}, a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space, we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding. Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a 3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

<title>SiamNAS: Siamese Surrogate Model for Dominance Relation Prediction in Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective, balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost. This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality, diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas, viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information, including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and codes are available in the project website, http://cvlab.snu.ac.kr/research/PhysGaia.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for dietary monitoring, medical nutrition management, and food intake analysis. Existing 3D Food Volume estimation methods accurately compute the food volume but lack for food portions selection. We present VolTex, a framework that improves \change{the food object selection} in food volume estimation. Allowing users to specify a target food item via text input to be segmented, our method enables the precise selection of specific food objects in real-world scenes. The segmented object is then reconstructed using the Neural Surface Reconstruction method to generate high-fidelity 3D meshes for volume computation. Extensive evaluations on the MetaFood3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in isolating and reconstructing food items for accurate volume estimation.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: We present PartComposer: a framework for part-level concept learning from single-image examples that enables text-to-image diffusion models to compose novel objects from meaningful components. Existing methods either struggle with effectively learning fine-grained concepts or require a large dataset as input. We propose a dynamic data synthesis pipeline generating diverse part compositions to address one-shot data scarcity. Most importantly, we propose to maximize the mutual information between denoised latents and structured concept codes via a concept predictor, enabling direct regulation on concept disentanglement and re-composition supervision. Our method achieves strong disentanglement and controllable composition, outperforming subject and part-level baselines when mixing concepts from the same, or different, object categories.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures. To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets. Video results are available at https://zju3dv.github.io/humanram/.

Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated  token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Understanding the informative structures of scenes is essential for low-level vision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay.

Abstract: Most consumer cameras use rolling shutter (RS) exposure, which often leads to distortions such as skew and jelly effects. These videos are further limited by bandwidth and frame rate constraints. In this paper, we explore the potential of event cameras, which offer high temporal resolution. We propose a framework to recover global shutter (GS) high-frame-rate videos without RS distortion by combining an RS camera and an event camera. Due to the lack of real-world datasets, our framework adopts a self-supervised strategy based on a displacement field, a dense 3D spatiotemporal representation of pixel motion during exposure. This enables mutual reconstruction between RS and GS frames and facilitates slow-motion recovery. We combine RS frames with the displacement field to generate GS frames, and integrate inverse mapping and RS frame warping for self-supervision. Experiments on four datasets show that our method removes distortion, reduces bandwidth usage by 94 percent, and achieves 16 ms per frame at 32x interpolation.

Abstract: Robust 6DoF pose estimation with mobile devices is the foundation for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and digital twin localization. In this paper, we extensively investigate the robustness of existing RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation methods against varying levels of depth sensor noise. We highlight that existing 6DoF pose estimation methods suffer significant performance discrepancies due to depth measurement inaccuracies. In response to the robustness issue, we present a simple and effective transformer-based 6DoF pose estimation approach called DTTDNet, featuring a novel geometric feature filtering module and a Chamfer distance loss for training. Moreover, we advance the field of robust 6DoF pose estimation and introduce a new dataset -- Digital Twin Tracking Dataset Mobile (DTTD-Mobile), tailored for digital twin object tracking with noisy depth data from the mobile RGBD sensor suite of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTTDNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at least 4.32, up to 60.74 points in ADD metrics on the DTTD-Mobile. More importantly, our approach exhibits superior robustness to varying levels of measurement noise, setting a new benchmark for robustness to measurement noise.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation tasks naturally require high-resolution information for pixel-wise segmentation and global context information for class prediction. While existing vision transformers demonstrate promising performance, they often utilize high-resolution context modeling, resulting in a computational bottleneck. In this work, we challenge conventional wisdom and introduce the Low-Resolution Self-Attention (LRSA) mechanism to capture global context at a significantly reduced computational cost, i.e., FLOPs. Our approach involves computing self-attention in a fixed low-resolution space regardless of the input image's resolution, with additional 3x3 depth-wise convolutions to capture fine details in the high-resolution space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LRSA approach by building the LRFormer, a vision transformer with an encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on the ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that LRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/LRFormer.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), initially developed for static scenes, have inspired many video novel view synthesis techniques. However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a consequence of object or camera movements during exposure, which hinders the precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a novel motion deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called MoBluRF, consisting of a Base Ray Initialization (BRI) stage and a Motion Decomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. In the BRI stage, we coarsely reconstruct dynamic 3D scenes and jointly initialize the base rays which are further used to predict latent sharp rays, using the inaccurate camera pose information from the given blurry frames. In the MDD stage, we introduce a novel Incremental Latent Sharp-rays Prediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion components. We further propose two loss functions for effective geometry regularization and decomposition of static and dynamic scene components without any mask supervision. Experiments show that MoBluRF outperforms qualitatively and quantitatively the recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is a crucial challenge in computer vision, driving extensive research into a diverse range of methods, from advanced meta-learning techniques to simple transfer learning baselines. With the emergence of vision foundation models (VFM) serving as generalist feature extractors, we seek to explore the adaptation of these models for FSS. While current FSS benchmarks focus on adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with few images, they emphasize in-domain generalization, making them less suitable for VFM trained on large-scale web datasets. To address this, we propose a novel realistic benchmark with a simple and straightforward adaptation process tailored for this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent VFM and semantic segmentation models. To evaluate their effectiveness, we leverage various adaption methods, ranging from linear probing to parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Our findings show that models designed for segmentation can be outperformed by self-supervised (SSL) models. On the other hand, while PEFT methods yields competitive performance, they provide little discrepancy in the obtained results compared to other methods, highlighting the critical role of the feature extractor in determining results. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the adaptation of VFM for FSS.

Abstract: Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. "a CEO" and "an Assistant"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74\% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.

Abstract: The development and adoption of Vision Transformers and other deep-learning architectures for image classification tasks has been rapid. However, the "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps.

Abstract: In this paper, we present and study a new instance-level retrieval task: PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM), which aims to identify the exact cross-modal instance that matches a given point-cloud query or text query. PTM has potential applications in various scenarios, such as indoor/urban-canyon localization and scene retrieval. However, there is a lack of suitable and targeted datasets for PTM in practice. To address this issue, we present a new PTM benchmark dataset, namely SceneDepict-3D2T. We observe that the data poses significant challenges due to its inherent characteristics, such as the sparsity, noise, or disorder of point clouds and the ambiguity, vagueness, or incompleteness of texts, which render existing cross-modal matching methods ineffective for PTM. To overcome these challenges, we propose a PTM baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method (RoMa). RoMa consists of two key modules: a Dual Attention Perception module (DAP) and a Robust Negative Contrastive Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages token-level and feature-level attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on useful local and global features, and aggregate them into common representations, thereby reducing the adverse impact of noise and ambiguity. To handle noisy correspondence, RNCL enhances robustness against mismatching by dividing negative pairs into clean and noisy subsets and assigning them forward and reverse optimization directions, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on our benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of our RoMa.

Abstract: This paper introduces the physics-inspired synthesized underwater image dataset (PHISWID), a dataset tailored for enhancing underwater image processing through physics-inspired image synthesis. For underwater image enhancement, data-driven approaches (e.g., deep neural networks) typically demand extensive datasets, yet acquiring paired clean atmospheric images and degraded underwater images poses significant challenges. Existing datasets have limited contributions to image enhancement due to lack of physics models, publicity, and ground-truth atmospheric images. PHISWID addresses these issues by offering a set of paired atmospheric and underwater images. Specifically, underwater images are synthetically degraded by color degradation and marine snow artifacts from atmospheric RGB-D images. It is enabled based on a physics-based underwater image observation model. Our synthetic approach generates a large quantity of the pairs, enabling effective training of deep neural networks and objective image quality assessment. Through benchmark experiments with some datasets and image enhancement methods, we validate that our dataset can improve the image enhancement performance. Our dataset, which is publicly available, contributes to the development in underwater image processing.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in large-scale image classification. However, when training from scratch on small datasets, there is still a significant performance gap between ViTs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is attributed to the lack of inductive bias. To address this issue, we propose a Graph-based Vision Transformer (GvT) that utilizes graph convolutional projection and graph-pooling. In each block, queries and keys are calculated through graph convolutional projection based on the spatial adjacency matrix, while dot-product attention is used in another graph convolution to generate values. When using more attention heads, the queries and keys become lower-dimensional, making their dot product an uninformative matching function. To overcome this low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, we employ talking-heads technology based on bilinear pooled features and sparse selection of attention tensors. This allows interaction among filtered attention scores and enables each attention mechanism to depend on all queries and keys. Additionally, we apply graph-pooling between two intermediate blocks to reduce the number of tokens and aggregate semantic information more effectively. Our experimental results show that GvT produces comparable or superior outcomes to deep convolutional networks and surpasses vision transformers without pre-training on large datasets. The code for our proposed model is publicly available on the website.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve low-illumination images. However, existing methods face two challenges: (1) uncertainty in restoration from diverse brightness degradations; (2) loss of texture and color information caused by noise suppression and light enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement approach, CodeEnhance, by leveraging quantized priors and image refinement to address these challenges. In particular, we reframe LLIE as learning an image-to-code mapping from low-light images to discrete codebook, which has been learned from high-quality images. To enhance this process, a Semantic Embedding Module (SEM) is introduced to integrate semantic information with low-level features, and a Codebook Shift (CS) mechanism, designed to adapt the pre-learned codebook to better suit the distinct characteristics of our low-light dataset. Additionally, we present an Interactive Feature Transformation (IFT) module to refine texture and color information during image reconstruction, allowing for interactive enhancement based on user preferences. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that the incorporation of prior knowledge and controllable information transfer significantly enhances LLIE performance in terms of quality and fidelity. The proposed CodeEnhance exhibits superior robustness to various degradations, including uneven illumination, noise, and color distortion.

Abstract: We introduce VectorPainter, a novel framework designed for reference-guided text-to-vector-graphics synthesis. Based on our observation that the style of strokes can be an important aspect to distinguish different artists, our method reforms the task into synthesize a desired vector graphics by rearranging stylized strokes, which are vectorized from the reference images. Specifically, our method first converts the pixels of the reference image into a series of vector strokes, and then generates a vector graphic based on the input text description by optimizing the positions and colors of these vector strokes. To precisely capture the style of the reference image in the vectorized strokes, we propose an innovative vectorization method that employs an imitation learning strategy. To preserve the style of the strokes throughout the generation process, we introduce a style-preserving loss function. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing works in stylized vector graphics synthesis, as well as the effectiveness of the various components of our method.

Abstract: Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. Additionally, this work introduces OralBBNet, an architecture featuring distinct segmentation and detection heads as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for teeth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over U-Net over various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score when compared with other segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

Abstract: Efficient computation in deep neural networks is crucial for real-time object detection. However, recent advancements primarily result from improved high-performing hardware rather than improving parameters and FLOP efficiency. This is especially evident in the latest YOLO architectures, where speed is prioritized over lightweight design. As a result, object detection models optimized for low-resource environments like microcontrollers have received less attention. For devices with limited computing power, existing solutions primarily rely on SSDLite or combinations of low-parameter classifiers, creating a noticeable gap between YOLO-like architectures and truly efficient lightweight detectors. This raises a key question: Can a model optimized for parameter and FLOP efficiency achieve accuracy levels comparable to mainstream YOLO models? To address this, we introduce two key contributions to object detection models using MSCOCO as a base validation set. First, we propose LeNeck, a general-purpose detection framework that maintains inference speed comparable to SSDLite while significantly improving accuracy and reducing parameter count. Second, we present LeYOLO, an efficient object detection model designed to enhance computational efficiency in YOLO-based architectures. LeYOLO effectively bridges the gap between SSDLite-based detectors and YOLO models, offering high accuracy in a model as compact as MobileNets. Both contributions are particularly well-suited for mobile, embedded, and ultra-low-power devices, including microcontrollers, where computational efficiency is critical.

Abstract: Facial analysis is a key component in a wide range of applications such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and entertainment. Despite the availability of various facial RGB datasets, the thermal modality, which plays a crucial role in life sciences, medicine, and biometrics, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce the T-FAKE dataset, a new large-scale synthetic thermal dataset with sparse and dense landmarks. To facilitate the creation of the dataset, we propose a novel RGB2Thermal loss function, which enables the domain-adaptive transfer of RGB faces to thermal style. By utilizing the Wasserstein distance between thermal and RGB patches and the statistical analysis of clinical temperature distributions on faces, we ensure that the generated thermal images closely resemble real samples. Using RGB2Thermal style transfer based on our RGB2Thermal loss function, we create the large-scale synthetic thermal T-FAKE dataset with landmark and segmentation annotations. Leveraging our novel T-FAKE dataset, probabilistic landmark prediction, and label adaptation networks, we demonstrate significant improvements in landmark detection methods on thermal images across different landmark conventions. Our models show excellent performance with both sparse 70-point landmarks and dense 478-point landmark annotations. Moreover, our RGB2Thermal loss leads to notable results in terms of perceptual evaluation and temperature prediction.

Abstract: Predicting and reasoning how a video would make a human feel is crucial for developing socially intelligent systems. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive video understanding capabilities, they tend to focus more on the semantic content of videos, often overlooking emotional stimuli. Hence, most existing MLLMs fall short in estimating viewers' emotional reactions and providing plausible explanations. To address this issue, we propose StimuVAR, a spatiotemporal Stimuli-aware framework for Video Affective Reasoning (VAR) with MLLMs. StimuVAR incorporates a two-level stimuli-aware mechanism: frame-level awareness and token-level awareness. Frame-level awareness involves sampling video frames with events that are most likely to evoke viewers' emotions. Token-level awareness performs tube selection in the token space to make the MLLM concentrate on emotion-triggered spatiotemporal regions. Furthermore, we create VAR instruction data to perform affective training, steering MLLMs' reasoning strengths towards emotional focus and thereby enhancing their affective reasoning ability. To thoroughly assess the effectiveness of VAR, we provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol with extensive metrics. StimuVAR is the first MLLM-based method for viewer-centered VAR. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in understanding viewers' emotional responses to videos and providing coherent and insightful explanations. Our code is available at https://github.com/EthanG97/StimuVAR

Abstract: Physics simulation is paramount for modeling and utilization of 3D scenes in various real-world applications. However, its integration with state-of-the-art 3D scene rendering techniques such as Gaussian Splatting (GS) remains challenging. Existing models use additional meshing mechanisms, including triangle or tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, or cage meshes. As an alternative, we can modify the physics grounded Newtonian dynamics to align with 3D Gaussian components. Current models take the first-order approximation of a deformation map, which locally approximates the dynamics by linear transformations. In contrast, our Gaussian Splatting for Physics-Based Simulations (GASP) model uses such a map (without any modifications) and flat Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces). Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity within a 3D space. Consequently, the problem of modeling Gaussian components is reduced to working with 3D points. Additionally, the information on mesh faces can be used to incorporate further properties into the physics model, facilitating the use of triangles. Resulting solution can be integrated into any physics engine that can be treated as a black box. As demonstrated in our studies, the proposed model exhibits superior performance on a diverse range of benchmark datasets designed for 3D object rendering.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often comes with widespread hallucination issues, making cost-effective and comprehensive assessments increasingly vital. Current approaches mainly rely on costly annotations and are not comprehensive -- in terms of evaluating all aspects such as relations, attributes, and dependencies between aspects. Therefore, we introduce the FIHA (autonomous Fine-graIned Hallucination evAluation evaluation in LVLMs), which could access hallucination LVLMs in the LLM-free and annotation-free way and model the dependency between different types of hallucinations. FIHA can generate Q&amp;A pairs on any image dataset at minimal cost, enabling hallucination assessment from both image and caption. Based on this approach, we introduce a benchmark called FIHA-v1, which consists of diverse questions on various images from MSCOCO and Foggy. Furthermore, we use the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to organize the structure among Q&amp;A pairs, in which we can increase the reliability of the evaluation. We evaluate representative models using FIHA-v1, highlighting their limitations and challenges. We released our code and data.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) capabilities is accompanied by a concerning rise in its misuse. In particular the generation of credible misinformation in the form of images poses a significant threat to the public trust in democratic processes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tools to reliably distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. The majority of detection methods are based on neural networks that are trained to recognize forensic artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples under real-world conditions. Through extensive experiments, comprising four detection methods and five attack algorithms, we show that an attacker can dramatically decrease classification performance, without internal knowledge of the detector's architecture. Notably, most attacks remain effective even when images are degraded during the upload to, e.g., social media platforms. In a case study, we demonstrate that these robustness challenges are also found in commercial tools by conducting black-box attacks on HIVE, a proprietary online GenAI media detector. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of using generated features of a robust pre-trained model and showed that this increases the robustness, while not reaching the performance on benign inputs. These results, along with the increasing potential of GenAI to erode public trust, underscore the need for more research and new perspectives on methods to prevent its misuse.

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually bear a significant amount of computational overhead despite sparsity of information in them when compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy.

Abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) is a crucial technology for observing, monitoring, and interpreting our planet, with broad applications across geoscience, economics, humanitarian fields, etc. While artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has achieved significant advances in RS, unique challenges persist in developing more intelligent RS systems, including the complexity of Earth's environments, diverse sensor modalities, distinctive feature patterns, varying spatial and spectral resolutions, and temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans.

<title>Visual-TCAV: Concept-based Attribution and Saliency Maps for Post-hoc Explainability in Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen significant performance improvements in recent years. However, due to their size and complexity, they function as black-boxes, leading to transparency concerns. State-of-the-art saliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the input image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of interest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation. On the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a concept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show its location within the input image. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc explainability framework, Visual-TCAV, which aims to bridge the gap between these methods by providing both local and global explanations for CNN-based image classification. Visual-TCAV uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to generate saliency maps that show where concepts are recognized by the network. Moreover, it can estimate the attribution of these concepts to the output of any class using a generalization of Integrated Gradients. This framework is evaluated on popular CNN architectures, with its validity further confirmed via experiments where ground truth for explanations is known, and a comparison with TCAV. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataSciencePolimi/Visual-TCAV.

Abstract: We propose a general approach to optimize noise schedules for training and sampling in diffusion models. Our approach optimizes the noise schedules to ensure a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process. Any distance metric for measuring the probability-distributional change is applicable to our approach, and we introduce three distance metrics. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on unconditional and class-conditional image-generation tasks using the LSUN (Horse, Bedroom, Church), ImageNet, FFHQ, and CIFAR10 datasets. Through extensive experiments, we confirmed that our approach broadly improves the performance of pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models regardless of the dataset, sampler, and number of function evaluations ranging from 5 to 250. Notably, by using our approach for optimizing both training and sampling schedules, we achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.03 without sacrificing mode coverage on LSUN Horse 256 $\times$ 256.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance rapidly, rigorous evaluation has become essential, providing further guidance for their development. In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in six key perception abilities (ranging from counting, OCR, to understanding structural data), focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse types of questions, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current main-stream MLLMs, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models; (2) uncover interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; (3) reveal the primary reason of ability conflict is data mixing ratio and LLM model size; and (4) discuss the effectiveness of some straightforward strategies \eg, fine-tuning and model merging, to solve the ability conflict. The benchmark and online leaderboard is released in https://github.com/Chenfeng1271/AbilityLens.

<title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

<title>VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in critical fields where predictions need to be accompanied by justifications is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In this paper, we introduce P-TAME (Perturbation-based Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a model-agnostic method for explaining DNN-based image classifiers. P-TAME employs an auxiliary image classifier to extract features from the input image, bypassing the need to tailor the explanation method to the internal architecture of the backbone classifier being explained. Unlike traditional perturbation-based methods, which have high computational requirements, P-TAME offers an efficient alternative by generating high-resolution explanations in a single forward pass during inference. We apply P-TAME to explain the decisions of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, three distinct and widely used image classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method matches or outperforms previous explainability methods, including model-specific approaches. Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been leveraged to address inverse problems without additional training, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) (Chung et al., 2022a) is among the most popular approaches. Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal Language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts, pushing the frontiers of the omni-modal language model to a large extent. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of architectural design, data curation, and training strategies essential for building a robust omni-modal model. Ola incorporates advanced visual understanding and audio recognition capabilities through several critical and effective improvements over mainstream baselines. Moreover, we rethink inter-modal relationships during omni-modal training, emphasizing cross-modal alignment with video as a central bridge, and propose a progressive training pipeline that begins with the most distinct modalities and gradually moves towards closer modality alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is crucial for enhancing the spatial resolution of Earth System Model (ESM) data, thereby enabling more precise analysis of environmental processes. This paper introduces ViFOR, a novel SR algorithm integrating Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Fourier-based Implicit Neural Representation Networks (INRs). ViFOR effectively captures global context and high-frequency details essential for accurate SR reconstruction by embedding Fourier-based activation functions within the transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViFOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including ViT, SIREN, and SRGANs, in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both global and local imagery. ViFOR achieves PSNR improvements of up to 4.18 dB, 1.56 dB, and 1.73 dB over ViT on full-image Source Temperature, Shortwave, and Longwave Flux datasets. These results highlight ViFOR's effectiveness and potential for advancing high-resolution climate data analysis.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations. We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities. We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DC (Decouple)-ControlNet, a highly flexible and precisely controllable framework for multi-condition image generation. The core idea behind DC-ControlNet is to decouple control conditions, transforming global control into a hierarchical system that integrates distinct elements, contents, and layouts. This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and Inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships. Extensive evaluations show that DC-ControlNet significantly outperforms existing ControlNet models and Layout-to-Image generative models in terms of control flexibility and precision in multi-condition control.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated the underlying risk of generating various unwanted content, such as sexual elements. To address this issue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any undesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether training-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side, i.e., texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to limitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image content. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the output side, i.e., generated images, may be more direct and effective, we propose Concept Corrector. It checks target concepts based on visual features provided by final generated images predicted at certain time steps. Further, it incorporates Concept Removal Attention to erase generated concept features. It overcomes the limitations of existing methods, which are either unable to remove the concept features that have been generated in images or rely on the assumption that the related concept words are contained in input prompts. In the whole pipeline, our method changes no model parameters and only requires a given target concept as well as the corresponding replacement content, which is easy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure method based on intermediate-generated images, achieving the ability to erase concepts on the fly. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its impressive erasure performance.

Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limits generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and improve the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-model attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaozhen228/Bayes-PFL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4 points vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recognizing arbitrary or previously unseen categories is essential for comprehensive real-world 3D scene understanding. Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training or together at inference. This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes derived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes. Our exhaustive experiments on SceneSplat-7K demonstrate the significant benefit of the proposed method over the established baselines.

Abstract: We present Video Motion Graphs, a system designed to generate realistic human motion videos. Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

Abstract: Shapes and textures are the basic building blocks of visual perception. The ability to identify shapes regardless of orientation, texture, or context, and to recognize textures and materials independently of their associated objects, is essential for a general visual understanding of the world. This work introduces the Large Shape and Textures dataset (LAS&amp;T), a giant collection of highly diverse shapes and textures, created by unsupervised extraction of patterns from natural images. This dataset is used to benchmark how effectively leading Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) understand shapes, textures, and materials in 2D and 3D scenes. For shape recognition, we test the models' ability to match images of identical shapes that differ in orientation, texture, color, or environment. Our results show that the shape recognition capabilities of the LVLMs remain significantly below human performance. LVLMs rely predominantly on high-level and semantic features and struggle with abstract shapes lacking clear class associations. For texture and material recognition, we evaluated the models' ability to identify images with identical textures and materials across different objects and environments. Interestingly, leading LVLMs approach human-level performance in recognizing materials in 3D scenes, yet substantially underperform humans when identifying simpler more abstract 2D textures. These results are consistent across a wide range of leading VLMs (GPT/Gemini/LLama/Qwen) and foundation vision models (DINO/CLIP), exposing major deficiencies in the ability of leading models to understand fundamental visual concepts. In contrast, simple nets trained directly for these tasks achieve high accuracy. The LAS&amp;T dataset has been made available.

<title>PixelCAM: Pixel Class Activation Mapping for Histology Image Classification and ROI Localization</title>

Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods allow training models to classify images and localize ROIs. WSOL only requires low-cost image-class annotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier. Standard WSOL methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according to a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations with histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and scarce localization cues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between classification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal because it is constrained to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with classification. This allows learning discriminant features and accurate delineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localization and image classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/background pixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object localization. Using partial-cross entropy, PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a pretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneously using standard gradient descent. In addition, our pixel classifier can easily be integrated into CNN- and transformer-based architectures without any modifications.

Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in audio-driven talking head generation, text-driven methods remain underexplored. In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: This paper studies continual test-time adaptation (CTTA), the task of adapting a model to constantly changing unseen domains in testing while preserving previously learned knowledge. Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online test-time domain generalization framework for CTTA, dubbed TestDG. TestDG aims to learn features invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing, improving the potential for effective generalization to future domains. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. TestDG achieved state of the art on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.

Abstract: Real-time wildlife detection in drone imagery supports critical ecological and conservation monitoring. However, standard detection models like YOLO often fail to generalize across locations and struggle with rare species, limiting their use in automated drone deployments. We present MMLA, a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude drone dataset collected across three sites (Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The Wilds in Ohio), featuring six species (zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African wild dogs). The dataset contains 811K annotations from 37 high-resolution videos. Baseline YOLO models show performance disparities across locations while fine-tuning YOLOv11m on MMLA improves mAP50 to 82%, a 52-point gain over baseline. Our results underscore the need for diverse training data to enable robust animal detection in autonomous drone systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Recent developments in prompt learning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in target-specific tasks. However, these prompting methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or generalizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that overfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge. The general knowledge has a strong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Features Matrix (FM) approach designed to enhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and leverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the FM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective, preserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of overfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is compatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2) the FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific tasks (base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset generalization), achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D models from 2D sketches is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and sparsity of sketch data. In this paper, we present S3D, a novel framework that converts simple hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D models. Our method utilizes a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture to convert sketches into face segmentation masks, which are then used to generate a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel views. To ensure robust consistency between the sketch domain and the 3D output, we introduce a novel style-alignment loss that aligns the U-Net bottleneck features with the initial encoder outputs of the 3D generation module, significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity. To further enhance the network's robustness, we apply augmentation techniques to the sketch dataset. This streamlined framework demonstrates the effectiveness of S3D in generating high-quality 3D models from sketch inputs.

Abstract: Mobile robots are reaching unprecedented speeds, with platforms like Unitree B2, and Fraunhofer O3dyn achieving maximum speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. However, effectively utilizing such speeds remains a challenge due to the limitations of RGB cameras, which suffer from motion blur and fail to provide real-time responsiveness. Event cameras, with their asynchronous operation, and low-latency sensing, offer a promising alternative for high-speed robotic perception. In this work, we introduce MTevent, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation and moving object detection in highly dynamic environments with large detection distances. Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an RGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16 unique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles, varying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine high-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions, making it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To establish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's FoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with ground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in such dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve perception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity, identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation time.

Abstract: We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs) to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients. However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training, histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples, and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme, eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference. This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic, immersive scenarios.

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5\% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MCU.

However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot classification abilities, demonstrating great potential for generating weakly supervised labels. Unfortunately, existing weakly supervised learning methods are short of ability in generating accurate labels via VLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised labeling setting, namely True-False Labels (TFLs) which can achieve high accuracy when generated by VLMs. The TFL indicates whether an instance belongs to the label, which is randomly and uniformly sampled from the candidate label set. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator to explore and utilize the conditional probability distribution information of TFLs. Besides, we propose a convolutional-based Multi-modal Prompt Retrieving (MRP) method to bridge the gap between the knowledge of VLMs and target learning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TFL setting and MRP learning method. The code to reproduce the experiments is at https://github.com/Tranquilxu/TMP.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in sign language video processing, including the task of sign to written language translation, is how we learn representations of sign language in an effective and efficient way that preserves the important attributes of these languages, while remaining invariant to irrelevant visual differences. Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body pose of the signer. However, instead of fully relying on pose estimation from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn a representation of the complex handshapes and facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar translation performance, using less than 3\% of the compute.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are widely utilized for mapping and exploration tasks due to their cost-effectiveness. Multi-robot systems offer scalability and efficiency, especially in terms of the number of robots deployed in more complex environments. These tasks belong to the set of Multi-Robot Informative Path Planning (MRIPP) problems. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for the MRIPP problem. We aim to maximize the number of discovered stationary targets in an unknown 3D environment while operating under resource constraints (such as path length). Here, each robot aims to maximize discovered targets, avoid unknown static obstacles, and prevent inter-robot collisions while operating under communication and resource constraints. We utilize the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm to train a single policy neural network. A key aspect of our approach is our coordination graph that prioritizes visiting regions not yet explored by other robots. Our learned policy can be copied onto any number of robots for deployment in more complex environments not seen during training. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 26.2% in terms of the number of discovered targets while requiring a planning time of less than 2 sec per step. We present results for more complex environments with up to 64 robots and compare success rates against baseline planners.

<title>Eliminating Oversaturation and Artifacts of High Guidance Scales in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is crucial for improving both generation quality and alignment between the input condition and final output in diffusion models. While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: Text-based image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3, hold significant potential in content creation and publishing workflows, making them the focus in recent years. Despite their remarkable capability to generate diverse and vivid images, considerable efforts are being made to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as abusive, violent, or pornographic material. To assess the safety of existing models, we introduce a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which compromises image generation models through a step-by-step editing process. Specifically, for malicious queries that cannot bypass the safeguards with a single prompt, we intentionally decompose the query into multiple sub-queries. The image generation models are then prompted to generate and iteratively edit images based on these sub-queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CoJ attack method, we constructed a comprehensive dataset, CoJ-Bench, encompassing nine safety scenarios, three types of editing operations, and three editing elements. Experiments on four widely-used image generation services provided by GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, demonstrate that our CoJ attack method can successfully bypass the safeguards of models for over 60% cases, which significantly outperforms other jailbreaking methods (i.e., 14%). Further, to enhance these models' safety against our CoJ attack method, we also propose an effective prompting-based method, Think Twice Prompting, that can successfully defend over 95% of CoJ attack. We release our dataset and code to facilitate the AI safety research.

<title>Learning on Model Weights using Tree Experts</title>

Abstract: The number of publicly available models is rapidly increasing, yet most remain undocumented. Users looking for suitable models for their tasks must first determine what each model does. Training machine learning models to infer missing documentation directly from model weights is challenging, as these weights often contain significant variation unrelated to model functionality (denoted nuisance). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a weight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e., zero-shot model classification.

<title>Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes will be released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.

Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.

Abstract: The Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Document VQA (PFL-DocVQA) competition challenged the community to develop provably private and communication-efficient solutions in a federated setting for a real-life use case: invoice processing. The competition introduced a dataset of real invoice documents, along with associated questions and answers requiring information extraction and reasoning over the document images. Thereby, it brings together researchers and expertise from the document analysis, privacy, and federated learning communities. Participants fine-tuned a pre-trained, state-of-the-art Document Visual Question Answering model provided by the organizers for this new domain, mimicking a typical federated invoice processing setup. The base model is a multi-modal generative language model, and sensitive information could be exposed through either the visual or textual input modality. Participants proposed elegant solutions to reduce communication costs while maintaining a minimum utility threshold in track 1 and to protect all information from each document provider using differential privacy in track 2. The competition served as a new testbed for developing and testing private federated learning methods, simultaneously raising awareness about privacy within the document image analysis and recognition community. Ultimately, the competition analysis provides best practices and recommendations for successfully running privacy-focused federated learning challenges in the future.

Abstract: Splenomegaly, the enlargement of the spleen, is an important clinical indicator for various associated medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease (SCD). Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely used metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a surrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing spleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but these are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high prevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline, DeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound images. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational autoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated segmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and our best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under single-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In addition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume estimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which further support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We evaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated by a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D ultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning to estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment.

Abstract: Sign language processing has traditionally relied on task-specific models, limiting the potential for transfer learning across tasks. Pre-training methods for sign language have typically focused on either supervised pre-training, which cannot take advantage of unlabeled data, or context-independent (frame or video segment) representations, which ignore the effects of relationships across time in sign language. We introduce SHuBERT (Sign Hidden-Unit BERT), a self-supervised contextual representation model learned from approximately 1,000 hours of American Sign Language video. SHuBERT adapts masked token prediction objectives to multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to predict multiple targets corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks including sign language translation, isolated sign language recognition, and fingerspelling detection.

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically [$^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.

Abstract: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has proven effective for parameter-efficient adaptation of pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks by inserting task-specific learnable prompt tokens. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on the recently established connection between Mixture of Experts (MoE) and prompt-based methods, wherein each attention head can be conceptualized as a composition of multiple MoE models, we reinterpret VPT as the introduction of new prompt experts into these MoE structures. We identify a key limitation in existing VPT frameworks: the restricted functional expressiveness of prompt experts, which remain static and thus limited in their adaptability. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a novel method that endows prompt experts with enhanced expressiveness while preserving parameter efficiency. Empirical evaluations on VTAB-1K and FGVC demonstrate that VAPT achieves substantial performance improvements, surpassing fully fine-tuned baselines by 7.34% and 1.04%, respectively. Moreover, VAPT consistently outperforms VPT while requiring fewer additional parameters. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis indicates that VAPT achieves optimal sample efficiency. Collectively, these results underscore the theoretical grounding and empirical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained visual-language models (VLMs) to a range of downstream tasks. While optimizing the context can be effective for improving performance on specific tasks, it can often lead to poor generalization performance on unseen classes or datasets sampled from different distributions. It may be attributed to the fact that textual prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions, leading to the forgetting of generalized knowledge derived from hand-crafted prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Similarity Paradigm with Textual Regularization (SPTR) for prompt learning without forgetting. SPTR is a two-pronged design based on hand-crafted prompts that is an inseparable framework. 1) To avoid forgetting general textual knowledge, we introduce the optimal transport as a textual regularization to finely ensure approximation with hand-crafted features and tuning textual features. 2) In order to continuously unleash the general ability of multiple hand-crafted prompts, we propose a similarity paradigm for natural alignment score and adversarial alignment score to improve model robustness for generalization. Both modules share a common objective in addressing generalization issues, aiming to maximize the generalization capability derived from multiple hand-crafted prompts. Four representative tasks (i.e., non-generalization few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset generalization, domain generalization) across 11 datasets demonstrate that SPTR outperforms existing prompt learning methods.

Abstract: Medical images are acquired at high resolutions with large fields of view in order to capture fine-grained features necessary for clinical decision-making. Consequently, training deep learning models on medical images can incur large computational costs. In this work, we address the challenge of downsizing medical images in order to improve downstream computational efficiency while preserving clinically-relevant features. We introduce MedVAE, a family of six large-scale 2D and 3D autoencoders capable of encoding medical images as downsized latent representations and decoding latent representations back to high-resolution images. We train MedVAE autoencoders using a novel two-stage training approach with 1,052,730 medical images. Across diverse tasks obtained from 20 medical image datasets, we demonstrate that (1) utilizing MedVAE latent representations in place of high-resolution images when training downstream models can lead to efficiency benefits (up to 70x improvement in throughput) while simultaneously preserving clinically-relevant features and (2) MedVAE can decode latent representations back to high-resolution images with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates that large-scale, generalizable autoencoders can help address critical efficiency challenges in the medical domain.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

<title>We Should Chart an Atlas of All the World's Models</title>

Abstract: Public model repositories now contain millions of models, yet most models remain undocumented and effectively lost. In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.

Abstract: There have been many attempts to leverage multiple diffusion models for collaborative generation, extending beyond the original domain. A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often produce suboptimal results when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused; modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.

Abstract: Information Visualization (InfoVis) systems utilize visual representations to enhance data interpretation. Understanding how visual attention is allocated is essential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking (ET) data presents challenges related to cost, privacy, and scalability. Computational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby advancing InfoVis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40 participants who analyzed graphs while responding to questions of varying complexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths with synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer. Our research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how question complexity and number of nodes influence performance. This work contributes to the development of predictive modeling in visual analytics, offering insights that can enhance the design and effectiveness of InfoVis systems.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance across a wide range of applications, current computational pathology models face significant diagnostic efficiency challenges due to their reliance on high-magnification whole-slide image analysis. This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.

Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on perspective video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and perspective video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The project website is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

<title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms</title>

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

<title>VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.

Summary:
GARE is a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that addresses the modality gap and false negatives in text-video retrieval. It introduces pair-specific increments to alleviate tension in representation space alignment. The ideal form of the increment is derived through a trust-region constrained approximation of the InfoNCE loss. A neural module is employed to compute the increment based on the semantic gap between text-video pairs. Regularization techniques are applied to stabilize learning and improve interpretability. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GARE enhances alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, showcasing the efficacy of gap-aware tension mitigation. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap), and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy. Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

Abstract: Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.

Summary: 
Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG) is introduced as a model-agnostic mechanism for providing efficient negative guidance in diffusion models. Unlike Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), NAG remains effective even under aggressive sampling step compression by applying extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG is able to restore effective negative guidance where CFG fails, while also maintaining fidelity across different architectures, sampling regimes, and modalities. Extensive experimentation demonstrates consistent improvements in text alignment, fidelity, and human-perceived quality. Ablation studies validate the design components of NAG, and user studies confirm a significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a training-free, model-agnostic inference-time approach, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

Summary: The article introduces a 3D detailizer, a neural model that can quickly transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a detailed asset based on an input text prompt. The model is trained using the text prompt to define shape class and details appearance. The coarse 3D proxy allows for structure control over the final shape and the model can be reused to generate various shapes with consistent style and appearance. Training involves distilling knowledge from a multi-view image diffusion model and using Score Distillation Sampling. The model is trained in two stages to generate shapes of increasing complexity. Results show superior quality compared to existing models and quick refining of shapes in less than a second. The method enables interactive 3D modeling workflow and shows strong generalizability across styles, structures, and object categories. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on the impact of reasoning length on multimodal large language models' ability to generate extended reasoning chains.
- Longer reasoning chains can lead to increased hallucination, as models drift away from image-grounded content towards language priors.
- The RH-AUC metric is introduced to measure how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, assessing visual grounding during reasoning.
- The RH-Bench diagnostic benchmark evaluates the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination across various multimodal tasks.
- Findings suggest that larger models achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, with training data types and domains influencing this balance more than volume. This highlights the need for evaluation frameworks that consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

arXiv:2505.21523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

Summary:
CogAD is a novel end-to-end autonomous driving model that mimics human cognitive processes. It incorporates global-to-local context processing for perception and intent-conditioned multi-mode trajectory generation for planning. The method offers advantages such as comprehensive environmental understanding, robust planning exploration, and diverse yet reasonable trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive demonstrate CogAD's state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end planning, particularly excelling in long-tail scenarios and generalizing well to complex real-world driving conditions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, prevailing methods remain fundamentally misaligned with human cognitive principles in both perception and planning. In this paper, we propose CogAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving model that emulates the hierarchical cognition mechanisms of human drivers. CogAD implements dual hierarchical mechanisms: global-to-local context processing for human-like perception and intent-conditioned multi-mode trajectory generation for cognitively-inspired planning. The proposed method demonstrates three principal advantages: comprehensive environmental understanding through hierarchical perception, robust planning exploration enabled by multi-level planning, and diverse yet reasonable multi-modal trajectory generation facilitated by dual-level uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive demonstrate that CogAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end planning, exhibiting particular superiority in long-tail scenarios and robust generalization to complex real-world driving conditions.

<div> annotation, image caption, vision-language alignment, AI-in-the-loop, human annotation

Summary:
Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) is an AI-in-the-loop methodology that aims to optimize human annotation efforts for image captions. It utilizes sequential annotation to reduce redundant workload and increase efficiency. By leveraging a multimodal interface that allows annotators to talk while annotating, CoTalk maximizes the number of annotated samples and improves their comprehensiveness within fixed budget constraints. The framework is evaluated based on intrinsic evaluations that measure the comprehensiveness of semantic units and extrinsic evaluations that assess the practical usage of annotated captions in vision-language alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that CoTalk improves annotation speed and retrieval performance compared to traditional parallel annotation methods, showing promise for enhancing the learning of robust vision-language alignment through optimized human annotation efforts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13% vs. 40.52%) over the parallel method.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel approach to procedure-aware video representation learning by utilizing state-change descriptions and counterfactuals as supervision signals for video encoders. By incorporating these signals, the model is able to understand how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations influence the sequence of action steps. The use of state-change descriptions helps the model better comprehend the cause and effect of each step in an activity, leading to improved performance on tasks such as temporal action segmentation and error detection. Through experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated, showcasing significant advancements in procedure-aware video understanding. <div>
arXiv:2506.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet, existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a framework for integrating perception, reasoning, and control for legged robots using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). VeBrain reformulates robotic control tasks into text-based MLLM objectives in a 2D visual space. A robotic adapter converts textual commands from MLLMs into motion policies for real robots, increasing adaptability and flexibility. The VeBrain-600k dataset, containing various capabilities of VeBrain, is created using multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) for mixing different capabilities. Experimental results show VeBrain outperforms existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL on 13 multimodal benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks. When deployed on legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain demonstrates strong adaptability, flexibility, and compositional capabilities, achieving substantial gains on tasks like MMVet and outperforming existing methods by 50% on average in legged robot tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted increasing attention to extend them to physical entities like legged robot. This typically requires MLLMs to not only grasp multimodal understanding abilities, but also integrate visual-spatial reasoning and physical interaction capabilities. Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these capabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common text-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and mapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to convert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots. From the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality instruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In VeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the data, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different capabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL. When deployed to legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain shows strong adaptability, flexibility, and compositional capabilities compared to existing methods. For example, compared to Qwen2.5-VL, VeBrain not only achieves substantial gains on MMVet by +5.6%, but also excels in legged robot tasks with +50% average gains.

<div> Keywords: Sign Language Translation, skeletal representations, hyperbolic geometry, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks, geometric contrastive loss

Summary:
Geo-Sign introduces a novel approach to Sign Language Translation by utilizing hyperbolic geometry to enhance skeletal representations. By projecting skeletal features derived from ST-GCNs into the Poincaré ball model, Geo-Sign aims to create more discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger articulations. The method includes a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fréchet mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss to improve the representations within the language model. By incorporating these components into an end-to-end translation framework as a regularisation function, Geo-Sign demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic geometry in improving Sign Language Translation. This approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art RGB methods but also preserves privacy and improves computational efficiency. The code for Geo-Sign is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project, involves the marsh deer in the Paran\'a Delta, while the second, WiMoBo, focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuy\'u National Park. A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance wildlife monitoring and management practices.

Abstract: FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for a classification and a regression task, despite the non-triviality of task heterogeneity with only a subtle correlation. The approach addresses the classification of a detected object (occupying the entire image frame) and regression for modeling a continuous property variable (for instances of an object class), a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves a label transformation approach that is amenable for use with only a single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss weighting schemes, when learning both tasks are collectively considered (classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error of 2.4%). The experiments performed used "Advanced Steel Property Dataset" contributed by us https://github.com/fastcandr/AdvancedSteel-Property-Dataset. The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with discrete object classes and its hardness property that can take continuous values. Our proposed FastCAR approach for task consolidation achieves training time efficiency (2.52x quicker) and reduced inference latency (55% faster) than benchmark MTL networks.

Summary: 
The article introduces Ctrl-Crash, a model for generating realistic car crash videos by conditioning on signals like bounding boxes, crash types, and initial image frames. This approach allows for creating counterfactual scenarios with minor variations in input leading to different crash outcomes. The model leverages classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal to provide fine-grained control during inference. Ctrl-Crash outperforms previous diffusion-based methods in terms of quantitative video quality metrics and human evaluations of physical realism and video quality. The model aims to address the challenge of generating realistic and controllable accident simulations to improve traffic safety. <div>

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years; however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.

<div> Keywords: Natural disasters, Visual question answering, VLMs, Zero-shot learning, FloodNet dataset

Summary:
Visual question answering (VQA) models play a crucial role in understanding damages caused by natural disasters. However, existing models lack the ability to answer open-ended questions. To address this limitation, a VLM-based zero-shot VQA method, called ZeShot-VQA, is proposed. This approach leverages large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and zero-shot learning to enable the model to answer questions with new possible answers without the need for fine-tuning. The method is tested on the post-disaster FloodNet dataset and shows flexibility in processing and generating answers that were not seen during training. By utilizing VLMs and zero-shot learning, ZeShot-VQA offers a more efficient and adaptable solution for disaster response teams, enabling them to gain deeper insights into the impact of natural disasters on affected communities. <div>
arXiv:2506.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures. Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which demonstrates its flexibility.

Summary: 

This work focuses on enhancing video understanding models by incorporating frame-grounded reasoning traces in natural language. The researchers introduce CoF-Data, a comprehensive dataset containing questions, answers, and reasoning traces linked to relevant video frames. They fine-tune existing video LLMs on this dataset to generate chain-of-thoughts (CoT) that accurately reference key frames in videos. Unlike previous methods, this approach does not require auxiliary networks for frame selection or captioning. The resulting models based on CoF exhibit improved performance on various video understanding benchmarks, outperforming leading video LLMs and reducing hallucination rates. The research showcases the effectiveness of grounding reasoning steps in video frames for enhanced video understanding. <div>
arXiv:2506.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that eliciting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate reasoning traces in natural language before answering the user's request can significantly improve their performance across tasks. This approach has been extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts (CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and, unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the hallucination rate.

Summary:
The paper explores the use of uncertainty-based confidence maps in training optical flow and stereo depth models to account for varying difficulties in learning across pixels and regions. The Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss is introduced to focus on challenging pixels and regions by using an error-based confidence measure. Additionally, the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss is proposed to handle difficult areas affected by occlusions, guiding the network towards more reliable feature matching. By combining the DB and OA losses, the training process effectively manages challenging pixels and regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in both optical flow and stereo depth tasks when applying the combined losses. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering spatially varying learning difficulties and providing tailored solutions for improved model training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional training for optical flow and stereo depth models typically employs a uniform loss function across all pixels. However, this one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences. To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training. Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed combination of the DB and OA losses.

Abstract: Although deep learning-based visual tracking methods have made significant progress, they exhibit vulnerabilities when facing carefully designed adversarial attacks, which can lead to a sharp decline in tracking performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models, termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding defense performance and efficiency.

Summary: <br />
This paper explores the utilization of latent diffusion models for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) tasks by leveraging the perceptual consistency within these models. The proposed Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG) algorithm utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to guide on-manifold sampling and generate consistent multi-scale feature maps. By incorporating perceptual features and input measurements, the method, named LGDM, achieves state-of-the-art performance on IQA datasets. This work is significant as it is the first to guide diffusion models with perceptual features for NR-IQA tasks, showcasing the superior generalization capabilities of diffusion models in generating high-quality image data. <div>

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements. Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA. Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

<div> Keywords: object detection, open-vocabulary, image captioning, natural language, performance improvement

Summary:
In this study, a plug-and-play solution called Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) is introduced to enhance user-specified class vocabularies for open-vocabulary object detection models. By utilizing an image captioner, VocAda automatically refines the vocabulary based on visible objects in an image, without the need for training. VocAda operates at inference time in three steps: generating image captions, extracting relevant nouns, and selecting classes from the user-defined vocabulary. Experimental evaluation on COCO and Objects365 datasets using state-of-the-art detectors demonstrates the consistent performance improvement offered by VocAda. The tool proves to be versatile and beneficial in tailoring object detection tasks to specific image contexts. The code for VocAda is openly available for further exploration and application.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection models allow users to freely specify a class vocabulary in natural language at test time, guiding the detection of desired objects. However, vocabularies can be overly broad or even mis-specified, hampering the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) to refine the user-defined vocabulary, automatically tailoring it to categories that are relevant for a given image. VocAda does not require any training, it operates at inference time in three steps: i) it uses an image captionner to describe visible objects, ii) it parses nouns from those captions, and iii) it selects relevant classes from the user-defined vocabulary, discarding irrelevant ones. Experiments on COCO and Objects365 with three state-of-the-art detectors show that VocAda consistently improves performance, proving its versatility. The code is open source.

Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Existing prompt-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in continual learning, leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for classification tasks; however, the tight coupling between foreground-background information and the coupled attention between prompts and image-text tokens present significant challenges in incremental medical object detection tasks, due to the conceptual gap between medical and natural domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the \method~framework, which comprises two main components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (\ipg), which decouples fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (\dpa), which decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and multi-category datasets, referred to as \dataset, and experiments demonstrate that \method~outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of 5.44\%, 4.83\%, 12.88\%, and 4.59\% in full data, 1-shot, 10-shot, and 50-shot settings, respectively.

Summary: 
The article introduces Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight framework for high-resolution image synthesis in generative modeling. LWD enables ultra-high-resolution image generation without additional computational overhead by incorporating scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective, wavelet energy maps, and time-dependent masking strategy. These components enhance spectral fidelity, localize detail-rich regions, and focus denoising supervision on high-frequency components during training.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware, signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for high-resolution generative modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the crucial task of brain tumor segmentation in medical imaging and propose innovative approaches to enhance its performance. The current state-of-the-art nnU-Net has shown promising results but suffers from extensive training requirements and underutilization of pre-trained weights. To overcome these limitations, we integrate Axial-Coronal-Sagittal convolutions and pre-trained weights from ImageNet into the nnU-Net framework, resulting in reduced training epochs, reduced trainable parameters, and improved efficiency. Two strategies for transferring 2D pre-trained weights to the 3D domain are presented, ensuring the preservation of learned relationships and feature representations critical for effective information propagation. Furthermore, we explore a joint classification and segmentation model that leverages pre-trained encoders from a brain glioma grade classification proxy task, leading to enhanced segmentation performance, especially for challenging tumor labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods in the fast training settings achieve comparable or even outperform the ensemble of cross-validation models, a common practice in the brain tumor segmentation literature.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) approaches in recognizing Bangla handwritten characters and numerals using limited labeled data. It demonstrates the applicability of these methods to scripts with intricate and complex structures, where dataset scarcity is a common challenge. Given the complexity of Bangla script, we hypothesize that models performing well on these characters can generalize effectively to languages of similar or lower structural complexity. To this end, we introduce SynergiProtoNet, a hybrid network designed to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten characters and digits. The model integrates advanced clustering techniques with a robust embedding framework to capture fine-grained details and contextual nuances. It leverages multi-level (both high- and low-level) feature extraction within a prototypical learning framework. We rigorously benchmark SynergiProtoNet against several state-of-the-art few-shot learning models: BD-CSPN, Prototypical Network, Relation Network, Matching Network, and SimpleShot, across diverse evaluation settings including Monolingual Intra-Dataset Evaluation, Monolingual Inter-Dataset Evaluation, Cross-Lingual Transfer, and Split Digit Testing. Experimental results show that SynergiProtoNet consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark in few-shot learning for handwritten character and digit recognition.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel graph attention network called BAGNet for point cloud semantic segmentation. BAGNet leverages boundary points to capture intricate spatial structural information using a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer). This reduces computational cost compared to traditional graph-based methods. Additionally, BAGNet utilizes a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract global features, ensuring model accuracy. Experimental results on standard datasets show that BAGNet outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and inference time, making it a promising approach for point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the point cloud data is inherently irregular and unstructured, point cloud semantic segmentation has always been a challenging task. The graph-based method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand, BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.

Summary: 
UNSURF is introduced as a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface reconstruction in clinical brain MRI scans, capable of handling scans of varying orientation, resolution, and contrast. It relies on comparing predicted with actual voxel-wise signed distance functions (SDFs) to estimate uncertainty accurately. Traditional uncertainty measures like voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance are found inadequate for this task. UNSURF effectively enables automated quality control of surface reconstructions at different levels and enhances performance in Alzheimer's disease classification tasks. The experiments conducted on real clinical scans validate UNSURF's ability to estimate uncertainties that align well with ground truth errors, making it a valuable tool in improving the accuracy and reliability of cortical surface reconstruction in clinical settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose UNSURF, a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface reconstruction of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and contrast. It relies on the discrepancy between predicted voxel-wise signed distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures, such as voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate that UNSURF estimates correlate well with the ground truth errors and: \textit{(i)}~enable effective automated quality control of surface reconstructions at the subject-, parcel-, mesh node-level; and \textit{(ii)}~improve performance on a downstream Alzheimer's disease classification task.

Summary:<br /> 
The article introduces a new framework called SSAM for Test-time adaption (TTA) in image-text association modeling. The existing methods in TTA freeze the image encoder, which limits its ability to handle distribution shifts between training and test data. SSAM addresses this limitation by proposing dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase association learning. It consists of two components: Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE) and Prototype-anchored Image Reconstruction (PIR). SPE estimates probabilistic category associations to guide feature space reorganization, while PIR enforces encoder stability through cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments show that SSAM outperforms current TTA baselines while being computationally efficient. The framework is architecture-agnostic and minimally dependent on hyperparameters, making it practical for various applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaption (TTA) has witnessed important progress in recent years, the prevailing methods typically first encode the image and the text and design strategies to model the association between them. Meanwhile, the image encoder is usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios. We identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images often exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods persistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit supervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's crucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To address this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling), a new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase association learning. Our method operates via two synergistic components: 1) Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE), which estimates probabilistic category associations to guide feature space reorganization, and 2) Prototype-anchored Image Reconstruction (PIR), enforcing encoder stability through cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across diverse baseline methods and benchmarks demonstrate that SSAM can surpass state-of-the-art TTA baselines by a clear margin while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's architecture-agnostic design and minimal hyperparameter dependence further enhance its practical applicability.

<div> Distribution Matching Distillation, Text-to-Image Models, Large-Scale Models, Implicit Distribution Alignment, Intra-Segment Guidance

Summary: 
Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been effective for text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion 1.5, but struggles with convergence on larger models like SD 3.5 and FLUX. Analyzing these problems, the paper introduces implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to regulate generator and fake distribution distances. The intra-segment guidance (ISG) technique relocates timestep importance distribution from the teacher model. Employing IDA alone, DMD achieves convergence for SD 3.5, while using both IDA and ISG leads to convergence for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1 dev. With scaled-up discriminator models and the proposed improvements, the final model, named SenseFlow, demonstrates superior distillation performance for diffusion-based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and flow-matching models like SD 3.5 Large and FLUX. The source code for SenseFlow will be available at https://github.com/XingtongGe/SenseFlow.

Abstract: The Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been successfully applied to text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5. However, vanilla DMD suffers from convergence difficulties on large-scale flow-based text-to-image models, such as SD 3.5 and FLUX. In this paper, we first analyze the issues when applying vanilla DMD on large-scale models. Then, to overcome the scalability challenge, we propose implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to regularize the distance between the generator and fake distribution. Furthermore, we propose intra-segment guidance (ISG) to relocate the timestep importance distribution from the teacher model. With IDA alone, DMD converges for SD 3.5; employing both IDA and ISG, DMD converges for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1 dev. Along with other improvements such as scaled up discriminator models, our final model, dubbed \textbf{SenseFlow}, achieves superior performance in distillation for both diffusion based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and flow-matching models such as SD 3.5 Large and FLUX.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets using asynchronous cameras. It addresses the challenges of trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization simultaneously. By extending the trajectory intersection method, it eliminates the need for camera synchronization. Models for camera temporal information and target motion are developed, optimizing parameters for accurate trajectory reconstruction without precise time parameters. The method also optimizes camera rotations, improving reconstruction accuracy, especially with inaccurate rotations. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.

ViVo addresses this gap by including human-centric characteristics and dynamic visual phenomena in its video sequences.

The ViVo dataset stands out for its realistic and diverse content, serving as a valuable resource for advancing volumetric video technologies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As research on neural volumetric video reconstruction and compression flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However, existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin, hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid, etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks, highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Diffusion models have enabled precise facial editing, leading to the need for tracking sequences of edits like hair, makeup, etc. However, this poses challenges in attribution and robustness without datasets tailored for the task. To address this, the SEED dataset with over 90,000 images of sequentially edited faces is introduced. Each image has detailed edit sequences and attributes, facilitating research on tracking and analysis. A transformer-based model FAITH is proposed, incorporating high-frequency cues to enhance sensitivity to subtle changes in sequential edits. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of FAITH and the challenges presented by SEED. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled precise and photorealistic facial editing across a wide range of semantic attributes. Beyond single-step modifications, a growing class of applications now demands the ability to analyze and track sequences of progressive edits, such as stepwise changes to hair, makeup, or accessories. However, sequential editing introduces significant challenges in edit attribution and detection robustness, further complicated by the lack of large-scale, finely annotated benchmarks tailored explicitly for this task. We introduce SEED, a large-scale Sequentially Edited facE Dataset constructed via state-of-the-art diffusion models. SEED contains over 90,000 facial images with one to four sequential attribute modifications, generated using diverse diffusion-based editing pipelines (LEdits, SDXL, SD3). Each image is annotated with detailed edit sequences, attribute masks, and prompts, facilitating research on sequential edit tracking, visual provenance analysis, and manipulation robustness assessment. To benchmark this task, we propose FAITH, a frequency-aware transformer-based model that incorporates high-frequency cues to enhance sensitivity to subtle sequential changes. Comprehensive experiments, including systematic comparisons of multiple frequency-domain methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of FAITH and the unique challenges posed by SEED. SEED offers a challenging and flexible resource for studying progressive diffusion-based edits at scale. Dataset and code will be publicly released at: https://github.com/Zeus1037/SEED.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow, encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning, comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

Abstract: The characterization of mechanical properties for high-dynamic, high-velocity target motion is essential in industries. It provides crucial data for validating weapon systems and precision manufacturing processes etc. However, existing measurement methods face challenges such as limited dynamic range, discontinuous observations, and high costs. This paper presents a new approach leveraging an event-based multi-view photogrammetric system, which aims to address the aforementioned challenges. First, the monotonicity in the spatiotemporal distribution of events is leveraged to extract the target's leading-edge features, eliminating the tailing effect that complicates motion measurements. Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the target's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods. Finally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling accurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a light gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation of 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer.

<div> Keywords: prostate cancer, multimodal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, transrectal ultrasound, registration

Summary:
Prostate cancer diagnosis relies on multimodal imaging, notably MRI and TRUS. Current challenges in accurate registration between modalities due to dimensional and anatomical differences are addressed by a novel two-stage framework. The first stage involves a probe-location-independent TRUS 3D reconstruction using clustering-based feature matching. The second stage utilizes an unsupervised diffusion-based framework for cross-modal registration, mapping MR and US into a pseudo intermediate modality for easier alignment. An anatomy-aware registration strategy prioritizes internal structural coherence, improving alignment accuracy. Extensive validation shows superior registration accuracy and realistic deformations compared to existing methods, achieved in an unsupervised manner. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis through improved multimodal imaging registration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagnosis of prostate cancer increasingly depends on multimodal imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of 2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely unsupervised fashion.

<div> decoupling, segmentation, multimodal, attention, dataset

Summary:
Seg2Any is a novel segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) framework that addresses challenges in spatial layout control in text-to-image models. It utilizes advanced multimodal diffusion transformers and decouples segmentation masks into regional semantic and high-frequency shape components for semantic and shape consistency. The Semantic Alignment Attention Mask ensures entities adhere to text prompts, while the Entity Contour Map guides image spatial structure. An Attribute Isolation Attention Mask prevents attribute leakage across entities in multi-entity scenarios. The SACap-1M dataset contains 1 million images for open-set S2I generation, along with detailed region captions, evaluated using the SACap-Eval benchmark. Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained spatial and attribute control of entities on open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I) models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e. accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations. Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts. However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions, along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained spatial and attribute control of entities.

Abstract: We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research.

Summary:<br />
SatDreamer360 introduces a novel framework for generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery. It addresses the challenge of producing temporally and geometrically consistent sequences without relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps. The framework utilizes a compact tri-plane representation to encode scene geometry directly from a single satellite image. A pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane to ensure accurate cross-view correspondence. An epipolar-constrained temporal attention module aligns features across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. The proposed framework achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes. The work also introduces a large-scale dataset, VIGOR++, for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. <div>

Abstract: Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation, autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane, enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes.

Abstract: With the advancement of modern medicine and the development of technologies such as MRI, CT, and cellular analysis, it has become increasingly critical for clinicians to accurately interpret various diagnostic images. However, modern medical education often faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality teaching materials, stemming from privacy concerns and a shortage of educational resources (Balogh et al., 2015). In this context, image data generated by machine learning models, particularly generative models, presents a promising solution. These models can create diverse and comparable imaging datasets without compromising patient privacy, thereby supporting modern medical education.

<div> Keyword: personalization, diffusion models, consistency optimization, rescaling technique, prompt alignment

Summary:
Personalizing diffusion models for specific users or concepts with limited reference images remains a challenge. Existing methods like DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit, leading to misalignment between generated images and text prompts. Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) partially alleviates this issue but struggles with complex or stylized prompts. This paper proposes a parallel rescaling technique for personalized diffusion models that decomposes the consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, interference with CFG is minimized while preserving the subject's identity. No additional training data or expensive annotations are required. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity, even on challenging stylized prompts. This technique shows promise in providing stable and accurate personalization for diverse user inputs.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available. Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods, even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization for diverse user inputs.

The article introduces a new method, permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion (PI-H2T), to tackle the challenges posed by imbalanced long-tailed data in deep learning models. The method addresses issues of deformed representation space and biased classifiers by enhancing the representation space through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF) and transferring semantic information from head to tail classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF). Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that PI-H2T optimizes both the representation space and decision boundaries, leading to improved recognition accuracy for tail classes. The plug-and-play design of PI-H2T allows for easy integration into existing methods, offering a straightforward path to enhancing performance on long-tailed benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2506.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imbalanced distribution of long-tailed data presents a significant challenge for deep learning models, causing them to prioritize head classes while neglecting tail classes. Two key factors contributing to low recognition accuracy are the deformed representation space and a biased classifier, stemming from insufficient semantic information in tail classes. To address these issues, we propose permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion (PI-H2T), a highly adaptable method. PI-H2T enhances the representation space through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF), yielding more clustered features and automatic class margins. Additionally, it adjusts the biased classifier by transferring semantic information from head to tail classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF), improving tail class diversity. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that PI-H2T optimizes both the representation space and decision boundaries. Its plug-and-play design ensures seamless integration into existing methods, providing a straightforward path to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of PI-H2T.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel architecture for Text-to-CT image generation, combining a latent diffusion model and 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining. By using a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports, a shared embedding space is established for conditioning input. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space with a pretrained volumetric VAE for efficient 3D denoising diffusion. The model performs well on the CT-RATE dataset, showing superior performance compared to previous baselines in terms of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. The synthesized CT scans by the framework can effectively help improve diagnostic performance when augmenting real data. The study highlights the importance of modality-specific vision-language alignment for high-quality 3D medical image generation, offering a scalable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, with potential applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion, our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method called Video Signature (VIDSIG) for watermarking in generated videos. This method aims to address concerns around intellectual property protection and content tracing in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). VIDSIG integrates watermarking during the video generation process, providing a more efficient and balanced approach compared to post-generation methods. By fine-tuning the latent decoder with Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) and introducing a Temporal Alignment module, VIDSIG ensures high visual quality and temporal consistency in the generated videos. Experimental results demonstrate that VIDSIG outperforms existing methods in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. Additionally, VIDSIG shows robustness against tampering, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2506.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: image classifiers, adversarial attacks, pretrained vision transformers, low-rank adaptation, fine-tuning

Summary:
This study investigates the vulnerability of image classifiers, especially in applications like autonomous vehicle navigation, to adversarial attacks that can manipulate input images. The focus is on perturbations that can lead to misclassification without noticeable alterations to the images. To combat these attacks, the proposed solution involves adjusting the weights and classes of pretrained vision transformers. This adjustment includes a low-rank adaptation to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. By implementing this countermeasure, the pretrained models can be fine-tuned without the need for extensive retraining, making the approach scalable. This method aims to improve the resilience of image classifiers to attacks aimed at compromising their performance and reliability. The findings suggest that incorporating low-rank adaptation in the fine-tuning process can effectively enhance the defense mechanisms of vision transformers against adversarial manipulation.

arXiv:2506.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classifiers, such as those used for autonomous vehicle navigation, are largely known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that target the input image set. There is extensive discussion on adversarial attacks including perturbations that alter the input images to cause malicious misclassifications without perceivable modification. This work proposes a countermeasure for such attacks by adjusting the weights and classes of pretrained vision transformers with a low-rank adaptation to become more robust against adversarial attacks and allow for scalable fine-tuning without retraining.

Abstract: Robust scene segmentation and keyframe extraction are essential preprocessing steps in video understanding pipelines, supporting tasks such as indexing, summarization, and semantic retrieval. However, existing methods often lack generalizability across diverse video types and durations. We present a unified, adaptive framework for automatic scene detection and keyframe selection that handles formats ranging from short-form media to long-form films, archival content, and surveillance footage. Our system dynamically selects segmentation policies based on video length: adaptive thresholding for short videos, hybrid strategies for mid-length ones, and interval-based splitting for extended recordings. This ensures consistent granularity and efficient processing across domains. For keyframe selection, we employ a lightweight module that scores sampled frames using a composite metric of sharpness, luminance, and temporal spread, avoiding complex saliency models while ensuring visual relevance. Designed for high-throughput workflows, the system is deployed in a commercial video analysis platform and has processed content from media, education, research, and security domains. It offers a scalable and interpretable solution suitable for downstream applications such as UI previews, embedding pipelines, and content filtering. We discuss practical implementation details and outline future enhancements, including audio-aware segmentation and reinforcement-learned frame scoring.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces CineMA, an AI model developed to automate the extraction of clinically important measurements from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on a large dataset of cine CMR studies and demonstrated superior performance in tasks such as ventricle and myocardium segmentation, ejection fraction calculation, disease detection, and landmark localization. The model outperformed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieved comparable results with fewer annotations, reducing the burden of clinician labeling. CineMA's label efficiency makes it a valuable tool for future cardiac imaging applications, potentially replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning of foundation models. The availability of models and code on GitHub promotes reproducibility and facilitates access to high-performance models, enhancing clinical translation and accelerating research in cardiovascular medicine. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research. However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective. We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation. CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational resources, promoting reproducibility and accelerating clinical translation.

Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX) is introduced as a novel approach for interpreting Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) by identifying concept-specific token combinations. The framework utilizes two methods: a sample-level explanation method to analyze token importance scores in individual images, and a codebook-level explanation method to explore the entire codebook for globally relevant tokens. Experimental results show CORTEX's effectiveness in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, surpassing baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. CORTEX not only enhances the transparency of VQGMs but also finds applications in targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

<div> deformable phase plates, fovea stacking, aberration correction, optical systems, computational imaging <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Fovea Stacking, a novel imaging system utilizing deformable phase plates for localized aberration correction. By optimizing these deformations through a differentiable optical model, Fovea Stacking corrects off-axis aberrations locally, resulting in a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point. Multiple foveated images, each with a different fixation point, can be stacked to generate a composite image free from aberrations. The system efficiently covers the entire field of view through joint optimization of deformations under imaging budget constraints. A neural network-based control model is introduced for improved alignment between simulation and hardware performance due to the nonlinear behavior of DPP devices. Fovea stacking is shown to outperform traditional focus stacking for extended depth-of-field imaging. Additionally, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track objects of interest using object detection or eye-tracking, enabling real-time foveated video suitable for applications like surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays. <div>
arXiv:2506.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.
  In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates (DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware performance.
  We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays.

<div> Keywords: Human vision, Gestalt principles, Vision Transformers, Masked Autoencoding, Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench

Summary: 
The study explores whether modern vision models exhibit behaviors consistent with Gestalt principles observed in human vision. Using Vision Transformers trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE), the researchers found activation patterns in the models aligning with Gestalt laws, such as illusory contour completion and figure-ground segregation. A new testbench, DiSRT, was introduced to evaluate global spatial sensitivity in models, demonstrating that self-supervised models outperform supervised ones in capturing global structure information. The study also showed that ConvNeXt models trained with MAE exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations without attention architectures. However, classification finetuning can diminish this capability. Inspired by biological vision, a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism was proposed to enhance global sensitivity in models. These findings highlight training conditions that influence Gestalt-like perception in vision models and establish DiSRT as a tool for assessing global structure sensitivity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge. We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE) exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures. Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations, suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However, classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision, we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global structure sensitivity across models.

Summary:
The article introduces COinCO, a dataset created by inpainting objects in COCO images to generate unique images with both coherent and inconsistent contexts. Each inpainted object is evaluated and categorized through language model assessment. The dataset enables context learning and analysis of semantic priors affecting inpainting success across object categories. Key tasks include training context classifiers, Objects-from-Context prediction, and context-enhanced fake detection. The dataset serves as a testbed for context-aware visual understanding and image forensics. Code and data are available at the provided GitHub link. <div>
arXiv:2506.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in- or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3) context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations, establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in computer vision and image forensics.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to compressing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant disease classification, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The proposed method combines Weight Pruning and Knowledge Distillation, along with the integration of DenseNet with Involutional Layers to enhance spatial feature capture efficiency. The compressed models show promising results, with ResNet50 achieving high accuracy rates on PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets post-compression. A new, efficient DenseNet-based model also demonstrates excellent accuracy with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Agriculture is vital for global food security, but crops are vulnerable to diseases that impact yield and quality. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) accurately classify plant diseases using leaf images, their high computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained settings such as smartphones, edge devices, and real-time monitoring systems. This study proposes a two-step model compression approach integrating Weight Pruning and Knowledge Distillation, along with the hybridization of DenseNet with Involutional Layers. Pruning reduces model size and computational load, while distillation improves the smaller student models performance by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher network. The hybridization enhances the models ability to capture spatial features efficiently. These compressed models are suitable for real-time applications, promoting precision agriculture through rapid disease identification and crop management. The results demonstrate ResNet50s superior performance post-compression, achieving 99.55% and 98.99% accuracy on the PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets, respectively. The DenseNet-based model, optimized for efficiency, recorded 99.21% and 93.96% accuracy with a minimal parameter count. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieved 98.87% and 97.10% accuracy, supporting the practical deployment of energy-efficient devices for timely disease intervention and sustainable farming practices.

Summary:
ArtiScene is an innovative automated pipeline for designing 3D scenes based on text descriptions. It leverages text-to-image models trained on web-scale images to generate diverse and visually appealing 2D layouts, which are then used as intermediaries for guiding 3D synthesis. By extracting object shape and appearance from the 2D images, ArtiScene creates 3D models and assembles them into final scenes using geometry and pose information. This approach eliminates the need for additional training and outperforms existing benchmarks in layout and aesthetic quality. Through user studies and evaluation with GPT-4o, ArtiScene demonstrates superior performance with a high winning rate. The project page provides further details and showcases the capabilities of ArtiScene in scene design. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89% winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project page: https://artiscene-cvpr.github.io/

Abstract: Video processing for real-time analytics in resource-constrained environments presents a significant challenge in balancing energy consumption and video semantics. This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient video processing by proposing a system that dynamically optimizes processing configurations to minimize energy usage on the edge, while preserving essential video features for deep learning inference. We first gather an extensive offline profile of various configurations consisting of device CPU frequencies, frame filtering features, difference thresholds, and video bitrates, to establish apriori knowledge of their impact on energy consumption and inference accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an online system that employs multi-objective Bayesian optimization to intelligently explore and adapt configurations in real time. Our approach continuously refines processing settings to meet a target inference accuracy with minimal edge device energy expenditure. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in reducing video processing energy use while maintaining high analytical performance, offering a practical solution for smart devices and edge computing applications.

The paper introduces a novel depth-aware framework for motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) that utilizes 3D features for object association. By estimating depth through a zero-shot approach and incorporating it as an independent feature in the association process, the framework enhances tracking accuracy in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects.

Abstract: Current motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) approaches rely heavily on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for object association. Without using 3D features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features (monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Milad-Khanchi/DepthMOT

Summary: 
The paper introduces a system that generates realistic medical images from text descriptions and validates their accuracy with a classification model. A pretrained diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation on a dataset of colorectal histopathology tissue types. A ResNet-18 classification model achieved high accuracy in identifying the correct label for the generated images. The generative model underwent training multiple times with domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. An iterative process was used to filter inaccurate outputs and regenerate them until correctly classified. The system achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with high precision and recall. The self-validating approach demonstrates reliability in synthesizing domain-specific medical images. The system's potential applications include diagnostic support and clinical education, with future work focusing on prompt-specific accuracy and expanding to other medical imaging areas.

Abstract: Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other areas of medical imaging.

<div> alignment, medical vision-language models, preference data, context-aware, trustworthiness

Summary:
The paper introduces HSCR, a novel approach for improving alignment in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs). HSCR addresses the challenges of generating high-quality preference data cost-effectively and capturing nuanced preferences for enhanced alignment. By leveraging Med-VLMs' ability to generate dispreferred responses, HSCR identifies modality-coupled tokens causing misalignment and replaces them with hallucinated ones to produce high-quality dispreferred data. HSCR also implements a multi-level preference optimization strategy that incorporates nuanced implicit preferences for more precise alignment. Experimental results across various medical tasks show that HSCR enhances zero-shot performance and significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with minimal training data. This approach has the potential to enhance the reliability of Med-VLMs in clinical settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.

Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

<title>L3A: Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation for Multi-Label Class Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-zx/L3A.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving remarkable performance in face restoration. However, the heavy computations of diffusion models make it difficult to deploy them on devices like smartphones. In this work, we propose QuantFace, a novel low-bit quantization for one-step diffusion face restoration models, where the full-precision (\ie, 32-bit) weights and activations are quantized to 4$\sim$6-bit. We first analyze the data distribution within activations and find that they are highly variant. To preserve the original data information, we employ rotation-scaling channel balancing. Furthermore, we propose Quantization-Distillation Low-Rank Adaptation (QD-LoRA) that jointly optimizes for quantization and distillation performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy. We formulate such a strategy as an integer programming problem, which combines quantization error and perceptual metrics to find a satisfactory resource allocation. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QuantFace under 6-bit and 4-bit. QuantFace achieves significant advantages over recent leading low-bit quantization methods for face restoration. The code is available at https://github.com/jiatongli2024/QuantFace.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of understanding human activities from an egocentric perspective. Traditional activity recognition techniques face unique challenges in egocentric videos due to the highly dynamic nature of the head during many activities. We propose a framework that seeks to address these challenges in a way that is independent of network architecture by restricting the ego-video input to a stabilized, hand-focused video. We demonstrate that this straightforward video transformation alone outperforms existing egocentric video baselines on the Ego-Exo4D Fine-Grained Keystep Recognition benchmark without requiring any alteration of the underlying model infrastructure.

Abstract: The generation and editing of audio-conditioned talking portraits guided by multimodal inputs, including text, images, and videos, remains under explored. In this paper, we present SkyReels-Audio, a unified framework for synthesizing high-fidelity and temporally coherent talking portrait videos. Built upon pretrained video diffusion transformers, our framework supports infinite-length generation and editing, while enabling diverse and controllable conditioning through multimodal inputs. We employ a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to progressively align audio with facial motion, enabling fine-grained multimodal control over long video sequences. To enhance local facial coherence, we introduce a facial mask loss and an audio-guided classifier-free guidance mechanism. A sliding-window denoising approach further fuses latent representations across temporal segments, ensuring visual fidelity and temporal consistency across extended durations and diverse identities. More importantly, we construct a dedicated data pipeline for curating high-quality triplets consisting of synchronized audio, video, and textual descriptions. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that SkyReels-Audio achieves superior performance in lip-sync accuracy, identity consistency, and realistic facial dynamics, particularly under complex and challenging conditions.

Abstract: The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility, requires autonomous synchrotron beamline operations, a crucial technique that should enable experiments to be conducted automatically, reliably, and safely with minimum human intervention. However, current state-of-the-art synchrotron beamlines still heavily rely on human safety oversight. To bridge the gap between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a real beamline dataset demonstrate high accuracy, real-time performance, and strong potential for autonomous synchrotron beamline operations.

<title>Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context</title>

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.

<title>Breaking Latent Prior Bias in Detectors for Generalizable AIGC Image Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00874</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AIGC detectors often achieve near-perfect accuracy on images produced by the same generator used for training but struggle to generalize to outputs from unseen generators. We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias: detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true discriminative artifacts. To test against state-of-the-art generative models, we introduce GenImage++, a test-only benchmark of outputs from advanced generators (Flux.1, SD3) with extended prompts and diverse styles. We apply our adversarial-training paradigm to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines and evaluate across existing AIGC forensic benchmarks and recent challenge datasets. Extensive experiments show that adversarially trained detectors significantly improve cross-generator performance without any network redesign. Our findings on latent-prior bias offer valuable insights for future dataset construction and detector evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and generalizable AIGC forensic methodologies.

<title>Uneven Event Modeling for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement (CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision. Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information, leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency. This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection, tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization techniques.

<title>DS-VTON: High-Quality Virtual Try-on via Disentangled Dual-Scale Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. In this paper, we propose DS-VTON, a dual-scale virtual try-on framework that explicitly disentangles these objectives for more effective modeling. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. The second stage introduces a residual-guided diffusion process that reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between the two scales, focusing on texture fidelity. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation paradigm, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. By leveraging the semantic priors embedded in pretrained diffusion models, this design more effectively preserves the person's appearance and geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structural alignment and texture preservation across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

<title>3D Skeleton-Based Action Recognition: A Review</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: With the inherent advantages of skeleton representation, 3D skeleton-based action recognition has become a prominent topic in the field of computer vision. However, previous reviews have predominantly adopted a model-oriented perspective, often neglecting the fundamental steps involved in skeleton-based action recognition. This oversight tends to ignore key components of skeleton-based action recognition beyond model design and has hindered deeper, more intrinsic understanding of the task. To bridge this gap, our review aims to address these limitations by presenting a comprehensive, task-oriented framework for understanding skeleton-based action recognition. We begin by decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks, placing particular emphasis on preprocessing steps such as modality derivation and data augmentation. The subsequent discussion delves into critical sub-tasks, including feature extraction and spatio-temporal modeling techniques. Beyond foundational action recognition networks, recently advanced frameworks such as hybrid architectures, Mamba models, large language models (LLMs), and generative models have also been highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of public 3D skeleton datasets is presented, accompanied by an analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on these benchmarks. By integrating task-oriented discussions, comprehensive examinations of sub-tasks, and an emphasis on the latest advancements, our review provides a fundamental and accessible structured roadmap for understanding and advancing the field of 3D skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

arXiv:2506.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces AD-SVFD, a deep learning model for the deformable registration of vascular shapes to a pre-defined reference and for the generation of synthetic anatomies. AD-SVFD operates by representing each geometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as solutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are expressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are optimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference point clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse transformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure, that enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight sharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code that acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the network parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are fine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the use of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new anatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and applying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry. Numerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the high-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations at competitive computational costs.

arXiv:2506.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-defined 3D object templates are widely used in 3D reconstruction of hand-object interactions. However, they often require substantial manual efforts to capture or source, and inherently restrict the adaptability of models to unconstrained interaction scenarios, e.g., heavily-occluded objects. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new Text-Instructed Generation and Refinement (TIGeR) framework, harnessing the power of intuitive text-driven priors to steer the object shape refinement and pose estimation. We use a two-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided refinement. As the name implies, we first leverage off-the-shelf models to generate shape priors according to the text description without tedious 3D crafting. Considering the geometric gap between the synthesized prototype and the real object interacted with the hand, we further calibrate the synthesized prototype via 2D-3D collaborative attention. TIGeR achieves competitive performance, i.e., 1.979 and 5.468 object Chamfer distance on the widely-used Dex-YCB and Obman datasets, respectively, surpassing existing template-free methods. Notably, the proposed framework shows robustness to occlusion, while maintaining compatibility with heterogeneous prior sources, e.g., retrieved hand-crafted prototypes, in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for continual learning in anomaly detection, aimed at better reflecting real-world deployment scenarios. Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models. We release the benchmark and code in https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega.

Abstract: Camera trajectory generation is a cornerstone in computer graphics, robotics, virtual reality, and cinematography, enabling seamless and adaptive camera movements that enhance visual storytelling and immersive experiences. Despite its growing prominence, the field lacks a systematic and unified survey that consolidates essential knowledge and advancements in this domain. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of the field, covering from foundational definitions to advanced methodologies. We introduce the different approaches to camera representation and present an in-depth review of available camera trajectory generation models, starting with rule-based approaches and progressing through optimization-based techniques, machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive, efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.

Abstract: Projector-based adversarial attack aims to project carefully designed light patterns (i.e., adversarial projections) onto scenes to deceive deep image classifiers. It has potential applications in privacy protection and the development of more robust classifiers. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual classifiers and fixed camera poses, often neglecting the complexities of multi-classifier systems and scenarios with varying camera poses. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when introducing new classifiers or camera poses. In this paper, we introduce Classifier-Agnostic Projector-Based Adversarial Attack (CAPAA) to address these issues. First, we develop a novel classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization framework that aggregates adversarial and stealthiness loss gradients from multiple classifiers. Then, we propose an attention-based gradient weighting mechanism that concentrates perturbations on regions of high classification activation, thereby improving the robustness of adversarial projections when applied to scenes with varying camera poses. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CAPAA achieves both a higher attack success rate and greater stealthiness compared to existing baselines. Codes are available at: https://github.com/ZhanLiQxQ/CAPAA.

<title>IVY-FAKE: A Unified Explainable Framework and Benchmark for Image and Video AIGC Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos, driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel, unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over 150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700 evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content. Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-Safeguard/Ivy-Fake.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena. We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding.

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet. Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new parameters.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding poses a significant challenge for video large language models (VideoLLMs) due to prohibitively high computational and memory demands. In this paper, we propose FlexSelect, a flexible and efficient token selection strategy for processing long videos. FlexSelect identifies and retains the most semantically relevant content by leveraging cross-modal attention patterns from a reference transformer layer. It comprises two key components: (1) a training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages faithful cross-modal attention weights to estimate each video token's importance, and (2) a rank-supervised lightweight selector that is trained to replicate these rankings and filter redundant tokens. This generic approach can be seamlessly integrated into various VideoLLM architectures, such as LLaVA-Video, InternVL and Qwen-VL, serving as a plug-and-play module to extend their temporal context length. Empirically, FlexSelect delivers strong gains across multiple long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench. Moreover, it achieves significant speed-ups (for example, up to 9 times on a LLaVA-Video-7B model), highlighting FlexSelect's promise for efficient long-form video understanding.

<title>Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning for Versatile Control of Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

<title>Pseudo-Labeling Driven Refinement of Benchmark Object Detection Datasets via Analysis of Learning Patterns</title>

Abstract: Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3) class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image, MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS, and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset, MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable, high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) exhibits strong generalisation for promptable segmentation in video clips; however, its integration with the audio modality remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1) injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2. Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous methods in the field. Code is available at https://github.com/yyliu01/AuralSAM2.

Abstract: Multimodal MR-US registration is critical for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, this task remains challenging due to significant modality discrepancies. Existing methods often fail to align critical boundaries while being overly sensitive to irrelevant details. To address this, we propose an anatomically coherent modality translation (ACMT) network based on a hierarchical feature disentanglement design. We leverage shallow-layer features for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation. Unlike conventional modality translation methods that convert one modality into another, our ACMT introduces the customized design of an intermediate pseudo modality. Both MR and US images are translated toward this intermediate domain, effectively addressing the bottlenecks faced by traditional translation methods in the downstream registration task. Experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates modality-specific discrepancies while preserving crucial anatomical boundaries for accurate registration. Quantitative evaluations show superior modality similarity compared to state-of-the-art modality translation methods. Furthermore, downstream registration experiments confirm that our translated images achieve the best alignment performance, highlighting the robustness of our framework for multi-modal prostate image registration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in vision-language tasks, yet their ability to understand and act within embodied environments remains underexplored. We present NavBench, a benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2) step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment, we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases. Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios. However, most models struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in estimating progress during navigation, which may pose a key challenge.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods are susceptible to introducing complex degradations and noticeable artifacts into high-resolution videos due to their inherent randomness. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.

<title>ECP-Mamba: An Efficient Multi-scale Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Method with State Space Model for PolSAR Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Recently, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification has been greatly promoted by deep neural networks. However,current deep learning-based PolSAR classification methods encounter difficulties due to its dependence on extensive labeled data and the computational inefficiency of architectures like Transformers. This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient framework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a state space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation scarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global feature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm without negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba architecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR classification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy prioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the localized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the lightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary multi-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate ECP-Mamba's effectiveness in balancing high accuracy with resource efficiency. On the Flevoland 1989 dataset, ECP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall accuracy of 99.70%, average accuracy of 99.64% and Kappa coefficient of 99.62e-2. Our code will be available at https://github.com/HaixiaBi1982/ECP_Mamba.

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental Low-Level Vision (LLV) task that synthesizes intermediate frames between existing ones while maintaining spatial and temporal coherence. VFI techniques have evolved from classical motion compensation-based approach to deep learning-based approach, including kernel-, flow-, hybrid-, phase-, GAN-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and more recently diffusion model-based approach. We introduce AceVFI, the most comprehensive survey on VFI to date, covering over 250+ papers across these approaches. We systematically organize and describe VFI methodologies, detailing the core principles, design assumptions, and technical characteristics of each approach. We categorize the learning paradigm of VFI methods namely, Center-Time Frame Interpolation (CTFI) and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI). We analyze key challenges of VFI such as large motion, occlusion, lighting variation, and non-linear motion. In addition, we review standard datasets, loss functions, evaluation metrics. We examine applications of VFI including event-based, cartoon, medical image VFI and joint VFI with other LLV tasks. We conclude by outlining promising future research directions to support continued progress in the field. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for both newcomers and experts seeking a deep understanding of modern VFI landscapes.

<title>Fighting Fire with Fire (F3): A Training-free and Efficient Visual Adversarial Example Purification Method in LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests, including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples, and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification, highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal identification.

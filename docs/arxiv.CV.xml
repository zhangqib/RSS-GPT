Summary: <br>
The article introduces a new transformer-based end-to-end detection network, AVIVDNetv2, for idling vehicle detection (IVD) using video and audio data. This network addresses the challenge of aligning audio and visual modalities by incorporating a cross-modal transformer, multiscale visual feature fusion module, and decoupled detection heads. Experimental results show that AVIVDNetv2 outperforms previous models, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) significantly. It achieves a new performance benchmark on the AVIVD dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art method for sounding object localization. The network helps reduce pollution and emissions by identifying idling vehicles in real-time, providing a more effective solution for promoting eco-friendly driving behavior. <div>

Abstract: Idling vehicle detection (IVD) supports real-time systems that reduce pollution and emissions by dynamically messaging drivers to curb excess idling behavior. In computer vision, IVD has become an emerging task that leverages video from surveillance cameras and audio from remote microphones to localize and classify vehicles in each frame as moving, idling, or engine-off. As with other cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence between audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide complementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio conveys engine activity beyond the visual field. The previous end-to-end model, which uses a basic attention mechanism, struggles to align these modalities effectively, often missing vehicle detections. To address this issue, we propose AVIVDNetv2, a transformer-based end-to-end detection network. It incorporates a cross-modal transformer with global patch-level learning, a multiscale visual feature fusion module, and decoupled detection heads. Extensive experiments show that AVIVDNetv2 improves mAP by 7.66 over the disjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline, with consistent AP gains across all vehicle categories. Furthermore, AVIVDNetv2 outperforms the state-of-the-art method for sounding object localization, establishing a new performance benchmark on the AVIVD dataset.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction from aerial images is fundamental for autonomous driving, urban planning, and virtual simulation, where smoothness, compactness, and accuracy are critical quality factors. Existing reconstruction methods often produce artifacts and inconsistencies that limit usability, while downstream tasks have a tendency to represent roads as planes for simplicity but at the cost of accuracy. We introduce FlexRoad, the first framework to directly address road surface smoothing by fitting Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surfaces to 3D road points obtained from photogrammetric reconstructions or geodata providers. Our method at its core utilizes the Elevation-Constrained Spatial Road Clustering (ECSRC) algorithm for robust anomaly correction, significantly reducing surface roughness and fitting errors. To facilitate quantitative comparison between road surface reconstruction methods, we present GeoRoad Dataset (GeRoD), a diverse collection of road surface and terrain profiles derived from openly accessible geodata. Experiments on GeRoD and the photogrammetry-based DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D) demonstrate that FlexRoad considerably surpasses commonly used road surface representations across various metrics while being insensitive to various input sources, terrains, and noise types. By performing ablation studies, we identify the key role of each component towards high-quality reconstruction performance, making FlexRoad a generic method for realistic road surface modeling.

<div> Hough transform, computer vision, line detection, persistent homology, Topological Data Analysis <br>
Summary: 
This article introduces a novel voting technique for line detection in computer vision using persistent homology in the Hough space. By detecting peaks in the Hough space through persistent homology instead of simple thresholding, the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques, showing enhanced robustness and improved performance on synthetic data. The study emphasizes the potential of integrating Topological Data Analysis techniques into existing methods and highlights the importance of exploring mathematically grounded improvements to enhance the stability of the Hough transform. The work inspires future research in leveraging topological tools in computer vision applications and encourages a deeper investigation into the mathematical stability of the Hough transform. <br><br> <div>
arXiv:2504.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hough transform is a popular and classical technique in computer vision for the detection of lines (or more general objects). It maps a pixel into a dual space -- the Hough space: each pixel is mapped to the set of lines through this pixel, which forms a curve in Hough space. The detection of lines then becomes a voting process to find those lines that received many votes by pixels. However, this voting is done by thresholding, which is susceptible to noise and other artifacts.
  In this work, we present an alternative voting technique to detect peaks in the Hough space based on persistent homology, which very naturally addresses limitations of simple thresholding. Experiments on synthetic data show that our method significantly outperforms the original method, while also demonstrating enhanced robustness.
  This work seeks to inspire future research in two key directions. First, we highlight the untapped potential of Topological Data Analysis techniques and advocate for their broader integration into existing methods, including well-established ones. Secondly, we initiate a discussion on the mathematical stability of the Hough transform, encouraging exploration of mathematically grounded improvements to enhance its robustness.

Abstract: Vision systems are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as surveillance, law enforcement, and transportation. However, their vulnerabilities to rare or unforeseen scenarios pose significant safety risks. To address these challenges, we introduce Context-Awareness and Interpretability of Rare Occurrences (CAIRO), an ontology-based human-assistive discovery framework for failure cases (or CP - Critical Phenomena) detection and formalization. CAIRO by design incentivizes human-in-the-loop for testing and evaluation of criticality that arises from misdetections, adversarial attacks, and hallucinations in AI black-box models. Our robust analysis of object detection model(s) failures in automated driving systems (ADS) showcases scalable and interpretable ways of formalizing the observed gaps between camera perception and real-world contexts, resulting in test cases stored as explicit knowledge graphs (in OWL/XML format) amenable for sharing, downstream analysis, logical reasoning, and accountability.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) from thermal images is a crucial technology for robotic systems operating in challenging conditions such as fog, smoke, and low light. The limited availability of labeled thermal data constrains the generalization capabilities of thermal MDE models compared to foundational RGB MDE models, which benefit from datasets of millions of images across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline that enhances thermal MDE through knowledge distillation from a versatile RGB MDE model. Our approach features a confidence-aware distillation method that utilizes the predicted confidence of the RGB MDE to selectively strengthen the thermal MDE model, capitalizing on the strengths of the RGB model while mitigating its weaknesses. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of the thermal MDE, independent of the availability of labeled depth supervision, and greatly expands its applicability to new scenarios. In our experiments on new scenarios without labeled depth, the proposed confidence-aware distillation method reduces the absolute relative error of thermal MDE by 22.88\% compared to the baseline without distillation.

arXiv:2504.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a serious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large transformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease classification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their computational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them impractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as MobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the required spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically transfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a MobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive attention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution, channels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and spatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled MobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95% reduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU and 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric validation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching attention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over standalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over MobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time, energy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how we can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models will be made available for replication after acceptance.

<div> Keywords: Multi-task visual grounding, Referring Expression Comprehension, Referring Expression Segmentation, Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning, Collaborative Predictions

Summary: 
Multi-task visual grounding (MTVG) involves Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Segmentation (RES). Existing approaches face limitations in fully incorporating linguistic content into visual feature extraction and effectively exploiting the relationship between REC and RES tasks. To address these issues, the Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning framework (PLVL) is proposed. PLVL enhances visual feature extraction with language guidance and eliminates the need for a separate cross-modal fusion module. A multi-task head is designed to facilitate collaborative predictions for REC and RES. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLVL outperforms existing methods in both REC and RES tasks. <div>
arXiv:2504.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task visual grounding (MTVG) includes two sub-tasks, i.e., Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Segmentation (RES). The existing representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which mainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature extraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal interaction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks. Albeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two limitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the entire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction and it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship between REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the collaborative prediction for more accurate output. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning framework for multi-task visual grounding, called PLVL, which not only finely mine the inherent feature expression of the visual modality itself but also progressively inject the language information to help learn linguistic-related visual features. In this manner, our PLVL does not need additional cross-modal fusion module while fully introducing the language guidance. Furthermore, we analyze that the localization center for REC would help identify the to-be-segmented object region for RES to some extent. Inspired by this investigation, we design a multi-task head to accomplish collaborative predictions for these two sub-tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that our PLVL obviously outperforms the representative methods in both REC and RES tasks. https://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL

Summary: 
The paper evaluates the performance of topological features for classifying firn image data. Firn, the layers of granular snow within glaciers, exhibit distinct topological and geometric structures that vary with depth. The study uses two classes of topological features and persistence curves to predict depth from microCT images. Different training-test scenarios show trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability. No single method dominates in all categories, highlighting the need to consider various factors when selecting a method. The research aims to understand the advantages, pitfalls, and trade-offs in topological featurization for firn image classification. <div>

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the performance of topological features for generalizable and robust classification of firn image data, with the broader goal of understanding the advantages, pitfalls, and trade-offs in topological featurization. Firn refers to layers of granular snow within glaciers that haven't been compressed into ice. This compactification process imposes distinct topological and geometric structure on firn that varies with depth within the firn column, making topological data analysis (TDA) a natural choice for understanding the connection between depth and structure. We use two classes of topological features, sublevel set features and distance transform features, together with persistence curves, to predict sample depth from microCT images. A range of challenging training-test scenarios reveals that no one choice of method dominates in all categories, and uncoveres a web of trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability.

Summary:<br>
This study introduces a deep learning approach for improving myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The lengthy scanning time of MPI SPECT can lead to issues such as patient discomfort and motion artifacts. By reducing projection angles, scanning time can be shortened, but this may affect image quality. The proposed method incorporates an observer loss term to enhance perfusion defect detection by preserving anthropomorphic channel features. Results show improved performance in detecting myocardial perfusion defects compared to traditional sparse-view protocols. The method also demonstrates the ability to restore left ventricle wall structure, mitigating sparse-sampling artifacts. Further evaluations are warranted to validate the effectiveness of this approach. <br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a widely used and cost-effective diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease. However, the lengthy scanning time in this imaging procedure can cause patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and potentially inaccurate diagnoses due to misalignment between the SPECT scans and the CT-scans which are acquired for attenuation compensation. Reducing projection angles is a potential way to shorten scanning time, but this can adversely impact the quality of the reconstructed images. To address this issue, we propose a detection-task-specific deep-learning method for sparse-view MPI SPECT images. This method integrates an observer loss term that penalizes the loss of anthropomorphic channel features with the goal of improving performance in perfusion defect-detection task. We observed that, on the task of detecting myocardial perfusion defects, the proposed method yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) significantly larger than the sparse-view protocol. Further, the proposed method was observed to be able to restore the structure of the left ventricle wall, demonstrating ability to overcome sparse-sampling artifacts. Our preliminary results motivate further evaluations of the method.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.

Summary: 
Deep CS-TRD is a novel automatic algorithm for detecting tree rings in whole cross-sections that utilizes a deep-learning-based approach (U-Net) to replace the traditional edge detection step. This allows the method to be applied to various image domains, including microscopy, scanner, and smartphone-acquired images, as well as different tree species such as Pinus taeda, Gleditsia triachantos, and Salix glauca. The researchers introduce two publicly available datasets of annotated images for the community.

This study is the first to examine automatic tree ring detection for such diverse tree species and acquisition conditions.

Abstract: An important capacity in visual object recognition is invariance to image-altering variables which leave the identity of objects unchanged, such as lighting, rotation, and scale. How do neural networks achieve this? Prior mechanistic interpretability research has illuminated some invariance-building circuitry in InceptionV1, but the results are limited and networks with different architectures have remained largely unexplored. This work investigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an architectural component which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that many convolutional channels in intermediate blocks exhibit scale invariant properties, computed by the element-wise residual summation of scale equivariant representations: the block input's smaller-scale copy with the block pre-sum output's larger-scale copy. Through subsequent ablation experiments, we attempt to causally link these neural properties with scale-robust object recognition behavior. Our tentative findings suggest how the residual stream computes scale invariance and its possible role in behavior. Code is available at: https://github.com/cest-andre/residual-stream-interp

Abstract: Short video platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, are used by billions of users. These platforms expose users to harmful content, ranging from clickbait or physical harms to hate or misinformation. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding and measurement of online harm on short video platforms. Toward this end, we present two large-scale datasets of multi-modal and multi-categorical online harm: (1) 60,906 systematically selected potentially harmful YouTube videos and (2) 19,422 videos annotated by three labeling actors: trained domain experts, GPT-4-Turbo (using 14 image frames, 1 thumbnail, and text metadata), and crowdworkers (Amazon Mechanical Turk master workers). The annotated dataset includes both (a) binary classification (harmful vs. harmless) and (b) multi-label categorizations of six harm categories: Information, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and Physical harms. Furthermore, the annotated dataset provides (1) ground truth data with videos annotated consistently across (a) all three actors and (b) the majority of the labeling actors, and (2) three data subsets labeled by individual actors. These datasets are expected to facilitate future work on online harm, aid in (multi-modal) classification efforts, and advance the identification and potential mitigation of harmful content on video platforms.

<div> Proposed Keywords: SignX, pose fusion, human activity recognition, Video2Pose module, sign recognition<br>
<br>
Summary: SignX is a new framework for sign language recognition that addresses the challenges of processing sign language data. It includes a Pose2Gloss component with a multi-track pose fusion layer and a Video2Pose module based on ViT. These components convert raw video into signer pose representation and enable compatibility with existing pose formats for sign recognition. By training SignX in a 2-stage framework, it achieves greater accuracy in recognizing signs from sign language videos compared to previous methods. The framework aims to establish a common pose estimation standard for sign language recognition tasks. <div>

Abstract: The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: An ongoing research challenge within several domains in computer vision is how to increase model generalization capabilities. Several attempts to improve model generalization performance are heavily inspired by human perceptual intelligence, which is remarkable in both its performance and efficiency to generalize to unknown samples. Many of these methods attempt to force portions of the network to be orthogonal, following some observation within neuroscience related to early vision processes. In this paper, we propose a loss component that regularizes the filtering kernels in the first convolutional layer of a network to make them nearly orthogonal. Deviating from previous works, we give the network flexibility in which pairs of kernels it makes orthogonal, allowing the network to navigate to a better solution space, imposing harsh penalties. Without architectural modifications, we report substantial gains in generalization performance using the proposed loss against previous works (including orthogonalization- and saliency-based regularization methods) across three different architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, ViT-b-16) and two difficult open-set recognition tasks: presentation attack detection in iris biometrics, and anomaly detection in chest X-ray images.

Summary:<br>
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have been introduced into image steganography to autonomically learn information embedding. However, challenges with invisibility and security persist. To address this, the Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy Network (CLPSTNet) is proposed, comprising multiple progressive multi-scale convolutional modules integrating Inception structures and dilated convolutions. The network extracts features at different scales and levels of detail, allowing for multi-scale feature extraction and refinement of shallow secret information features. Experimental results on ALASKA2, VOC2012, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate high PSNR, SSIM metrics, and decoding accuracy, with steganographic images generated by CLPSTNet achieving low steganalysis scores. The code for CLPSTNet is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, a large number of works have introduced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into image steganography, which transform traditional steganography methods such as hand-crafted features and prior knowledge design into steganography methods that neural networks autonomically learn information embedding. However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of invisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information embedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy Network (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale convolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated convolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a smaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local feature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the convolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for perceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to realize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine to coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in different fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed CLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the steganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You can find our code at \href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.

<div> Keywords: 3D object detection, radar-camera fusion, feature alignment, Dual-Route Alignment, Radar Feature Enhancement

Summary: 
RCAlign introduces a novel alignment model for radar and camera fusion in 3D object detection. The Dual-Route Alignment (DRA) module employs contrastive learning to align and fuse features between radar and camera, addressing feature misalignment caused by domain gaps. A Radar Feature Enhancement (RFE) module is proposed to enhance the density of radar BEV features using knowledge distillation loss, improving detection accuracy. The proposed RCAlign model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for radar-camera fusion in 3D object detection. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, RCAlign demonstrates a significant performance improvement in real-time 3D detection, with a 4.3% increase in NDS and an 8.4% increase in mAP. <div>
arXiv:2504.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D object detection algorithms based on radar and camera fusion have shown excellent performance, setting the stage for their application in autonomous driving perception tasks. Existing methods have focused on dealing with feature misalignment caused by the domain gap between radar and camera. However, existing methods either neglect inter-modal features interaction during alignment or fail to effectively align features at the same spatial location across modalities. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a new alignment model called Radar Camera Alignment (RCAlign). Specifically, we design a Dual-Route Alignment (DRA) module based on contrastive learning to align and fuse the features between radar and camera. Moreover, considering the sparsity of radar BEV features, a Radar Feature Enhancement (RFE) module is proposed to improve the densification of radar BEV features with the knowledge distillation loss. Experiments show RCAlign achieves a new state-of-the-art on the public nuScenes benchmark in radar camera fusion for 3D Object Detection. Furthermore, the RCAlign achieves a significant performance gain (4.3\% NDS and 8.4\% mAP) in real-time 3D detection compared to the latest state-of-the-art method (RCBEVDet).

Summary: 
SaENeRF is a novel self-supervised framework designed to improve the reconstruction of 3D scenes from event data captured by neuromorphic vision sensors. It addresses challenges faced by current event-based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods, such as artifacts and noise in reconstruction. SaENeRF normalizes predicted radiance variations based on accumulated event polarities, facilitating progressive learning for scene representation. It introduces regularization losses to suppress artifacts in low photometric change regions and enhance light intensity differences in non-zero events. The framework significantly reduces artifacts and improves the quality of reconstructions, achieving dense, photorealistic results. The code for SaENeRF is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2504.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are neuromorphic vision sensors that asynchronously capture changes in logarithmic brightness changes, offering significant advantages such as low latency, low power consumption, low bandwidth, and high dynamic range. While these characteristics make them ideal for high-speed scenarios, reconstructing geometrically consistent and photometrically accurate 3D representations from event data remains fundamentally challenging. Current event-based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods partially address these challenges but suffer from persistent artifacts caused by aggressive network learning in early stages and the inherent noise of event cameras. To overcome these limitations, we present SaENeRF, a novel self-supervised framework that effectively suppresses artifacts and enables 3D-consistent, dense, and photorealistic NeRF reconstruction of static scenes solely from event streams. Our approach normalizes predicted radiance variations based on accumulated event polarities, facilitating progressive and rapid learning for scene representation construction. Additionally, we introduce regularization losses specifically designed to suppress artifacts in regions where photometric changes fall below the event threshold and simultaneously enhance the light intensity difference of non-zero events, thereby improving the visual fidelity of the reconstructed scene. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces artifacts and achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis, leads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such as walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) datasets are crucial for various downstream tasks. However, GUI datasets often generate annotation information through automatic labeling, which commonly results in inaccurate GUI element BBox annotations, including missing, duplicate, or meaningless BBoxes. These issues can degrade the performance of models trained on these datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally, existing GUI datasets only provide BBox annotations visually, which restricts the development of visually related GUI downstream tasks. To address these issues, we introduce PixelWeb, a large-scale GUI dataset containing over 100,000 annotated web pages. PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that integrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure analysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis. Channel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of occlusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap annotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and stacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally, PixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and mask annotations. Manual verification by three independent annotators confirms the high quality and accuracy of PixelWeb annotations. Experimental results on GUI element detection tasks show that PixelWeb achieves performance on the mAP95 metric that is 3-7 times better than existing datasets. We believe that PixelWeb has great potential for performance improvement in downstream tasks such as GUI generation and automated user interaction.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have gained attention for their zero-shot inference using instructional text prompts. While these models excel in general computer vision, their potential for domain generalization in remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored. Existing approaches enhance prompt learning by generating visual prompt tokens but rely on full-image features, introducing noise and background artifacts that vary within a class, causing misclassification. To address this, we propose FrogDogNet, a novel prompt learning framework integrating Fourier frequency filtering and self-attention to improve RS scene classification and domain generalization. FrogDogNet selectively retains invariant low-frequency components while eliminating noise and irrelevant backgrounds, ensuring robust feature representation across domains. The model first extracts significant features via projection and self-attention, then applies frequency-based filtering to preserve essential structural information for prompt learning. Extensive experiments on four RS datasets and three domain generalization tasks show that FrogDogNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, demonstrating superior adaptability across domain shifts. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of frequency-based invariant feature retention in generalization, paving the way for broader applications.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that unifies parametric shape optimization objective functions by efficiently computing a one-dimensional normalized GIoU strongly correlated with IoU. MGIoU overcomes the limitations of existing methods such as regression-based losses and instability of IoU-based losses. The extension MGIoU+ supports optimizing unstructured convex shapes, providing a comprehensive solution for diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that MGIoU and MGIoU+ outperform existing losses while significantly reducing loss computation latency. The proposed MGIoU- is designed for tasks like collision-free trajectory prediction. The introduced loss functions satisfy metric properties, scale-invariance, and are fully differentiable, ensuring robustness as an objective function for shape optimization. The code for implementing MGIoU is available at https://ldtho.github.io/MGIoU.  <div>
arXiv:2504.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the similarity between parametric shapes is crucial for numerous computer vision tasks, where Intersection over Union (IoU) stands as the canonical measure. However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant shortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU, IoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific methods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As a result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has become scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To address this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by introducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that overcomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their unique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a simple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with IoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured convex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization across diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing loss computation latency by 10-40x. Additionally, MGIoU and MGIoU+ satisfy metric properties and scale-invariance, ensuring robustness as an objective function. We further propose MGIoU- for minimizing overlaps in tasks like collision-free trajectory prediction. Code is available at https://ldtho.github.io/MGIoU

arXiv:2504.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based networks have achieved strong performance in low-level vision tasks like image deraining by utilizing spatial or channel-wise self-attention. However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.

The article proposes a novel approach for aircraft recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery using deep learning. By incorporating structure-based SAR aircraft annotations, the multi-task structure guided learning (MTSGL) network aims to enhance recognition performance. The MTSGL includes a structural semantic awareness module to capture structural information and a structural consistency regularization module to maintain geometric consistency. This approach allows for a more interpretable and robust aircraft recognition process. Experiments conducted on a self-constructed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MTSGL in improving recognition accuracy and interpretability. The proposed method leverages expert-level aircraft prior knowledge and a structure-guided learning paradigm to better understand aircraft concepts in SAR imagery, resembling human cognitive processes. <div>

Abstract: Aircraft recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a fundamental mission in both military and civilian applications. Recently deep learning (DL) has emerged a dominant paradigm for its explosive performance on extracting discriminative features. However, current classification algorithms focus primarily on learning decision hyperplane without enough comprehension on aircraft structural knowledge. Inspired by the fined aircraft annotation methods for optical remote sensing images (RSI), we first introduce a structure-based SAR aircraft annotations approach to provide structural and compositional supplement information. On this basis, we propose a multi-task structure guided learning (MTSGL) network for robust and interpretable SAR aircraft recognition. Besides the classification task, MTSGL includes a structural semantic awareness (SSA) module and a structural consistency regularization (SCR) module. The SSA is designed to capture structure semantic information, which is conducive to gain human-like comprehension of aircraft knowledge. The SCR helps maintain the geometric consistency between the aircraft structure in SAR imagery and the proposed annotation. In this process, the structural attribute can be disentangled in a geometrically meaningful manner. In conclusion, the MTSGL is presented with the expert-level aircraft prior knowledge and structure guided learning paradigm, aiming to comprehend the aircraft concept in a way analogous to the human cognitive process. Extensive experiments are conducted on a self-constructed multi-task SAR aircraft recognition dataset (MT-SARD) and the effective results illustrate the superiority of robustness and interpretation ability of the proposed MTSGL.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel RGB-D Video Object Segmentation (VOS) method that utilizes multi-store feature memory for robust segmentation. It addresses the limitations of existing RGB-D segmentation methods by incorporating hierarchical modality selection and fusion to effectively combine features from RGB and depth modalities. A segmentation refinement module is developed to refine segmentation masks using the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), improving the reliability of segmentation results and reducing object drift. Spatio-temporal embedding and modality embedding are leveraged to feed mixed prompts and fused images into SAM for enhanced performance in RGB-D VOS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the latest RGB-D VOS benchmark.

Abstract: The RGB-Depth (RGB-D) Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to integrate the fine-grained texture information of RGB with the spatial geometric clues of depth modality, boosting the performance of segmentation. However, off-the-shelf RGB-D segmentation methods fail to fully explore cross-modal information and suffer from object drift during long-term prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel RGB-D VOS method via multi-store feature memory for robust segmentation. Specifically, we design the hierarchical modality selection and fusion, which adaptively combines features from both modalities. Additionally, we develop a segmentation refinement module that effectively utilizes the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) to refine the segmentation mask, ensuring more reliable results as memory to guide subsequent segmentation tasks. By leveraging spatio-temporal embedding and modality embedding, mixed prompts and fused images are fed into SAM to unleash its potential in RGB-D VOS. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the latest RGB-D VOS benchmark.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is highly sensitive to sensor type, observation conditions, and the intrinsic properties of the target. These factors can introduce substantial variations in the distribution of acquired infrared image data, a phenomenon known as domain shift. Such distribution discrepancies significantly hinder the generalization capability of ISTD models across diverse scenarios. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces an ISTD framework enhanced by domain adaptation. To alleviate distribution shift between datasets and achieve cross-sample alignment, we introduce Cross-view Channel Alignment (CCA). Additionally, we propose the Cross-view Top-K Fusion strategy, which integrates target information with diverse background features, enhancing the model' s ability to extract critical data characteristics. To further mitigate the impact of noise on ISTD, we develop a Noise-guided Representation learning strategy. This approach enables the model to learn more noise-resistant feature representations, to improve its generalization capability across diverse noisy domains. Finally, we develop a dedicated infrared small target dataset, RealScene-ISTD. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection probability (Pd), false alarm rate (Fa), and intersection over union (IoU).

Summary: 
This article presents a method for automatically calibrating radially distorted cameras in challenging conditions. Traditional methods require solving the full Structure from Motion problem or relying on learning-based approaches, which may be less accurate. The proposed method decouples distortion calibration from 3D reconstruction by working in Projective Space and leveraging pairwise projective relations. The Projective Radial Distortion Averaging technique averages multiple distortion estimates without creating 3D points or performing full bundle adjustment. This approach maintains the accuracy of SfM-based methods while simplifying the calibration process and supporting various feature-matching approaches. <div>

Abstract: We tackle the problem of automatic calibration of radially distorted cameras in challenging conditions. Accurately determining distortion parameters typically requires either 1) solving the full Structure from Motion (SfM) problem involving camera poses, 3D points, and the distortion parameters, which is only possible if many images with sufficient overlap are provided, or 2) relying heavily on learning-based methods that are comparatively less accurate. In this work, we demonstrate that distortion calibration can be decoupled from 3D reconstruction, maintaining the accuracy of SfM-based methods while avoiding many of the associated complexities. This is achieved by working in Projective Space, where the geometry is unique up to a homography, which encapsulates all camera parameters except for distortion. Our proposed method, Projective Radial Distortion Averaging, averages multiple distortion estimates in a fully projective framework without creating 3d points and full bundle adjustment. By relying on pairwise projective relations, our methods support any feature-matching approaches without constructing point tracks across multiple images.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). MFRA enhances an agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions, and navigation history by aggregating multi-level features across modalities. It includes a hierarchical fusion mechanism and a reasoning module that leverages fused representations. The reasoning module uses instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration to infer navigation actions accurately in complex scenarios. By selectively capturing and combining visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark VLN datasets show that MFRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal fusion for embodied navigation. <div>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to follow natural language instructions and reach target locations in real-world environments. While prior methods often rely on either global scene representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark VLN datasets including REVERIE, R2R, and SOON demonstrate that MFRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal fusion for embodied navigation.

Abstract: In neuroscience research, achieving single-neuron matching across different imaging modalities is critical for understanding the relationship between neuronal structure and function. However, modality gaps and limited annotations present significant challenges. We propose a few-shot metric learning method with a dual-channel attention mechanism and a pretrained vision transformer to enable robust cross-modal neuron identification. The local and global channels extract soma morphology and fiber context, respectively, and a gating mechanism fuses their outputs. To enhance the model's fine-grained discrimination capability, we introduce a hard sample mining strategy based on the MultiSimilarityMiner algorithm, along with the Circle Loss function. Experiments on two-photon and fMOST datasets demonstrate superior Top-K accuracy and recall compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and t-SNE visualizations validate the effectiveness of each module. The method also achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising technical solution for accurate single-cell level matching and multimodal neuroimaging integration.

Abstract: Streetscapes are an essential component of urban space. Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI's capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban-rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.

Summary:
Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors offer efficient depth sensing with low power consumption, but traditionally only sparse measurements are used in mobile and AR/VR devices. This limitation hinders the seamless integration of ToF depth data in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. To address this, the ToF-Splatting method introduced in this work utilizes Gaussian Splatting to process very sparse ToF data. By integrating information from sparse ToF depth, color data, and multi-view geometry, a multi-frame integration module generates dense depth maps. Experimental results on synthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ToF-Splatting, achieving superior tracking and mapping performance compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors provide efficient active depth sensing at relatively low power budgets; among such designs, only very sparse measurements from low-resolution sensors are considered to meet the increasingly limited power constraints of mobile and AR/VR devices. However, such extreme sparsity levels limit the seamless usage of ToF depth in SLAM. In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the viability of our approach, as it achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping performances on reference datasets.

Summary:
The article introduces ROAR, a privacy-preserving dataset obfuscation framework that removes sensitive objects while maintaining scene integrity. By combining instance segmentation with generative inpainting, ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision in 2D COCO-based object detection, outperforming traditional methods like image dropping. It demonstrates superior performance especially for small objects, with minimal degradation in 3D reconstruction tasks such as NeRF-based reconstruction. The method incurs a PSNR loss of only 1.66 dB, while maintaining comparable SSIM and improving LPIPS for enhanced perceptual quality. This approach highlights the efficacy of object removal in ensuring privacy protection and dataset utility, with potential for further advancements in generative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific scrubbing in privacy-preserving vision systems. <br> <div>

Abstract: We introduce ROAR (Robust Object Removal and Re-annotation), a scalable framework for privacy-preserving dataset obfuscation that eliminates sensitive objects instead of modifying them. Our method integrates instance segmentation with generative inpainting to remove identifiable entities while preserving scene integrity. Extensive evaluations on 2D COCO-based object detection show that ROAR achieves 87.5% of the baseline detection average precision (AP), whereas image dropping achieves only 74.2% of the baseline AP, highlighting the advantage of scrubbing in preserving dataset utility. The degradation is even more severe for small objects due to occlusion and loss of fine-grained details. Furthermore, in NeRF-based 3D reconstruction, our method incurs a PSNR loss of at most 1.66 dB while maintaining SSIM and improving LPIPS, demonstrating superior perceptual quality. Our findings establish object removal as an effective privacy framework, achieving strong privacy guarantees with minimal performance trade-offs. The results highlight key challenges in generative inpainting, occlusion-robust segmentation, and task-specific scrubbing, setting the foundation for future advancements in privacy-preserving vision systems.

Summary:
CountingDINO is introduced as a training-free exemplar-based Class-agnostic counting (CAC) framework that leverages unsupervised feature extractors for estimating the number of objects in images without predefined categories. The approach utilizes self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features without the need for annotated data in the entire pipeline. At inference time, object prototypes are extracted from DINO features via ROI-Align and utilized as convolutional kernels to generate similarity maps transformed into density maps through a simple normalization scheme. Evaluation on the FSC-147 benchmark shows superior performance over a baseline in a label-free setting and competitive results against supervised and state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. This highlights the scalability and competitiveness of training-free CAC approaches in the field of object counting.

Abstract: Class-agnostic counting (CAC) aims to estimate the number of objects in images without being restricted to predefined categories. However, while current exemplar-based CAC methods offer flexibility at inference time, they still rely heavily on labeled data for training, which limits scalability and generalization to many downstream use cases. In this paper, we introduce CountingDINO, the first training-free exemplar-based CAC framework that exploits a fully unsupervised feature extractor. Specifically, our approach employs self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features, and it eliminates the need for annotated data throughout the entire proposed pipeline. At inference time, we extract latent object prototypes via ROI-Align from DINO features and use them as convolutional kernels to generate similarity maps. These are then transformed into density maps through a simple yet effective normalization scheme. We evaluate our approach on the FSC-147 benchmark, where we outperform a baseline under the same label-free setting. Our method also achieves competitive -- and in some cases superior -- results compared to training-free approaches relying on supervised backbones, as well as several fully supervised state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates that training-free CAC can be both scalable and competitive. Website: https://lorebianchi98.github.io/CountingDINO/

Summary:
Federated learning was explored for training foundation models in minimally invasive surgery to overcome data-sharing limitations. The study adapted the Masked Autoencoder with Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Stochastic Weight Averaging, pretraining it on the Endo700k dataset. Results showed that integrating FedSAM improved pretraining and led to reduced reconstruction loss. The federated approach, FL-EndoViT, performed comparably to CEN-EndoViT in surgical tasks like Semantic Segmentation and Surgical Phase Recognition. FL-EndoViT excelled in limited data scenarios for surgical scene segmentation and with large datasets for action triplet recognition. The study concludes that federated learning offers a privacy-preserving solution for surgical data science, emphasizing the need to adapt methods like FedSAM for heterogeneous data. Future exploration of FL in video-based models could enhance capabilities for real-world surgical environments.

Abstract: Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models using federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable collaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.

Summary: <br>
Event cameras provide high-speed event streams for perception tasks. Existing methods using graph neural networks struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical structures of non-uniformly distributed event streams in Euclidean space. The proposed EHGCN approach combines Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces for event vision. It uses adaptive sampling to regulate sampling rates and a motion-aware hyperedge generation method based on Markov Vector Field to capture long-range dependencies and eliminate spurious associations. The Euclidean-Hyperbolic GCN fuses locally aggregated information in Euclidean space and globally hierarchically modeled information in hyperbolic space for hybrid event perception. Experimental results on object detection and recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Event cameras, with microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) characteristics, emit high-speed event stream for perception tasks. Despite the recent advancement in GNN-based perception methods, they are prone to use straightforward pairwise connectivity mechanisms in the pure Euclidean space where they struggle to capture long-range dependencies and fail to effectively characterize the inherent hierarchical structures of non-uniformly distributed event stream. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel approach named EHGCN, which is a pioneer to perceive event stream in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces for event vision. In EHGCN, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically regulate sampling rates, retaining discriminative events while attenuating chaotic noise. Then we present a Markov Vector Field (MVF)-driven motion-aware hyperedge generation method based on motion state transition probabilities, thereby eliminating cross-target spurious associations and providing critically topological priors while capturing long-range dependencies between events. Finally, we propose a Euclidean-Hyperbolic GCN to fuse the information locally aggregated and globally hierarchically modeled in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, respectively, to achieve hybrid event perception. Experimental results on event perception tasks such as object detection and recognition validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<div> NeRF, dual-camera, all-in-focus, defocus-aware fusion, multi-view dataset <br>
Summary: <br>
This article introduces a framework called DC-NeRF that can synthesize the all-in-focus neural radiance field (NeRF) without manual refocusing. By utilizing the dual-camera setup from smartphones, with the ultra-wide camera providing a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera offering higher resolution, DC-NeRF aligns and fuses images from both cameras to restore sharp, focused images. The approach includes spatial warping, color matching, and a defocus-aware fusion module to predict and adjust defocus parameters for accurate image synthesis. A multi-view dataset is created for testing, demonstrating the effectiveness of DC-NeRF in producing high-quality, all-in-focus images. The framework also enables depth-of-field applications like adjustable blur intensity and focal plane for tasks such as refocusing and split diopter effects. <div>

Abstract: We present the first framework capable of synthesizing the all-in-focus neural radiance field (NeRF) from inputs without manual refocusing. Without refocusing, the camera will automatically focus on the fixed object for all views, and current NeRF methods typically using one camera fail due to the consistent defocus blur and a lack of sharp reference. To restore the all-in-focus NeRF, we introduce the dual-camera from smartphones, where the ultra-wide camera has a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera possesses a higher resolution. The dual camera pair saves the high-fidelity details from the main camera and uses the ultra-wide camera's deep DoF as reference for all-in-focus restoration. To this end, we first implement spatial warping and color matching to align the dual camera, followed by a defocus-aware fusion module with learnable defocus parameters to predict a defocus map and fuse the aligned camera pair. We also build a multi-view dataset that includes image pairs of the main and ultra-wide cameras in a smartphone. Extensive experiments on this dataset verify that our solution, termed DC-NeRF, can produce high-quality all-in-focus novel views and compares favorably against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively. We further show DoF applications of DC-NeRF with adjustable blur intensity and focal plane, including refocusing and split diopter.

<div> Keywords: Transformer models, image restoration, RouteWinFormer, attention mechanism, long-range dependencies <br>
Summary: RouteWinFormer is a novel window-based Transformer model designed for image restoration tasks. It focuses on capturing middle-range pixel dependencies efficiently, as extensive research shows that long-range attention is often unnecessary for localized degradation and context. The model incorporates a Route-Windows Attention Module that selects nearby windows based on regional similarity, extending the receptive field to a mid-range size. Additionally, Multi-Scale Structure Regularization is introduced during training, allowing the network to focus on structural information and generalize image structure priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets for various image restoration tasks. <div>

Abstract: Transformer models have recently garnered significant attention in image restoration due to their ability to capture long-range pixel dependencies. However, long-range attention often results in computational overhead without practical necessity, as degradation and context are typically localized. Normalized average attention distance across various degradation datasets shows that middle-range attention is enough for image restoration. Building on this insight, we propose RouteWinFormer, a novel window-based Transformer that models middle-range context for image restoration. RouteWinFormer incorporates Route-Windows Attnetion Module, which dynamically selects relevant nearby windows based on regional similarity for attention aggregation, extending the receptive field to a mid-range size efficiently. In addition, we introduce Multi-Scale Structure Regularization during training, enabling the sub-scale of the U-shaped network to focus on structural information, while the original-scale learns degradation patterns based on generalized image structure priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets in various image restoration tasks.

Summary: 
Sign language recognition (SLR) systems aim to translate sign gestures into spoken language for individuals with hearing loss. A semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach was proposed to tackle the limited annotated datasets in SLR by using a pseudo-label method. The signer's skeletal joint points were encoded as pose information and fed into a Transformer backbone model in the SSL approach. Experiments with varying amounts of labeled data and classes showcased the SSL model's superior performance over a fully supervised learning model on the WLASL-100 dataset. The SSL model excelled with less labeled data in most cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in sign gesture recognition. <div>

Abstract: Sign language is the primary communication language for people with disabling hearing loss. Sign language recognition (SLR) systems aim to recognize sign gestures and translate them into spoken language. One of the main challenges in SLR is the scarcity of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach for SLR (SSLR), employing a pseudo-label method to annotate unlabeled samples. The sign gestures are represented using pose information that encodes the signer's skeletal joint points. This information is used as input for the Transformer backbone model utilized in the proposed approach. To demonstrate the learning capabilities of SSL across various labeled data sizes, several experiments were conducted using different percentages of labeled data with varying numbers of classes. The performance of the SSL approach was compared with a fully supervised learning-based model on the WLASL-100 dataset. The obtained results of the SSL model outperformed the supervised learning-based model with less labeled data in many cases.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel architecture called the Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) for human skeleton pose estimation from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net combines convolutional encoders with transformer-based attention mechanisms to extract spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses are then input into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. The model was tested on two datasets, demonstrating superior performance in pose estimation compared to existing methods. The DGNN also showed reliable action classification using CSI-based skeletons, with results comparable to RGB-based systems. TED Net proved to be effective in both fall and non-fall scenarios, showcasing the potential of CSI-driven human skeleton estimation for action recognition, particularly in environments where privacy concerns limit the use of vision-based methods.

Abstract: Human pose estimation and action recognition have received attention due to their critical roles in healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation, and assistive technologies. In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer based Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton poses from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates convolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture spatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were used as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action recognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi modal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected dataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants. Experimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches in pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification using CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems. Notably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall cases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton estimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments such as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often readily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based methods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.

Abstract: We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively counters the ``Vanishing Advantages'' dilemma inherent in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 79.0 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 74.0 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI o4-mini.

Abstract: We provide an open-source dataset of RGB and NIR-HSI (near-infrared hyperspectral imaging) images with associated segmentation masks and NIR spectra of 2242 individual malting barley kernels. We imaged every kernel pre-exposure to moisture and every 24 hours after exposure to moisture for five consecutive days. Every barley kernel was labeled as germinated or not germinated during each image acquisition. The barley kernels were imaged with black filter paper as the background, facilitating straight-forward intensity threshold-based segmentation, e.g., by Otsu's method. This dataset facilitates time series analysis of germination time for barley kernels using either RGB image analysis, NIR spectral analysis, NIR-HSI analysis, or a combination hereof.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. It focuses on extracting and separating common features and dominant features of multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images using a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) and space preserving visual mamba (SPVM). The attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed to effectively integrate significantly different features by calculating influence coefficients for pixel-wise linear fusion while retaining the feature size unchanged. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative approaches. The relevant code for implementing the model can be found on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images describe the same land surface, so these images not only have their own advantages, but also have a lot of similar information. In order to separate these similar information and their respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage. This paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the selective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) is designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective dominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual mamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by optimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the fusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and simple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly different features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence coefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences while keeping the feature size unchanged. Empirical evaluations indicate that the presented method achieves better results than alternative approaches. The relevant code can be found at:https://github.com/AVKSKVL/DAS-F-Model

A new dataset and method for automated visual inspection of sugar beets during storage is presented. The study focuses on detecting, segmenting, and estimating the mass of sugar beets in images. Extensive experiments are conducted to optimize detection and segmentation performance, considering factors such as damages, rot, soil adhesion, and vegetation.

Abstract: While sugar beets are stored prior to processing, they lose sugar due to factors such as microorganisms present in adherent soil and excess vegetation. Their automated visual inspection promises to aide in quality assurance and thereby increase efficiency throughout the processing chain of sugar production. In this work, we present a novel high-quality annotated dataset and two-stage method for the detection, semantic segmentation and mass estimation of post-harvest and post-storage sugar beets in monocular RGB images. We conduct extensive ablation experiments for the detection of sugar beets and their fine-grained semantic segmentation regarding damages, rot, soil adhesion and excess vegetation. For these tasks, we evaluate multiple image sizes, model architectures and encoders, as well as the influence of environmental conditions. Our experiments show an mAP50-95 of 98.8 for sugar-beet detection and an mIoU of 64.0 for the best-performing segmentation model.

Summary: <br>
Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that requires adapting models without access to source data. Existing SFDA techniques often suffer from negative transfer due to noisy pseudo-labels generated from confidence levels. To address this issue, a new method called Energy-Based Pseudo-Label Refining (EBPR) is proposed for SFDA. Pseudo-labels are created based on energy scores of sample clusters, and global and class energy thresholds are used to filter out unreliable pseudo-labels. Additionally, a contrastive learning strategy is incorporated to filter difficult samples and improve feature discriminability by aligning them with augmented versions. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA techniques. <br> <div>

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), which involves adapting models without access to source data, is both demanding and challenging. Existing SFDA techniques typically rely on pseudo-labels generated from confidence levels, leading to negative transfer due to significant noise. To tackle this problem, Energy-Based Pseudo-Label Refining (EBPR) is proposed for SFDA. Pseudo-labels are created for all sample clusters according to their energy scores. Global and class energy thresholds are computed to selectively filter pseudo-labels. Furthermore, a contrastive learning strategy is introduced to filter difficult samples, aligning them with their augmented versions to learn more discriminative features. Our method is validated on the Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA-C datasets, consistently finding that our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
ProMoGen is a novel framework for generating human motion that aligns with user intent by integrating trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion control. This approach allows for more controllable and precise character movements, with global trajectories ensuring spatial consistency and sparse anchor motions providing precise action guidance. The framework supports both dual and single control paradigms and incorporates SAP-CL, a curriculum learning strategy that progressively adjusts the number of anchors used for guidance to improve stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that ProMoGen excels in synthesizing vivid and diverse motions guided by predefined trajectories and arbitrary anchor frames, outperforming existing methods in various control scenarios. Overall, ProMoGen offers a sophisticated solution for personalized motion synthesis in computer animation, game design, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: In computer animation, game design, and human-computer interaction, synthesizing human motion that aligns with user intent remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have notable limitations: textual approaches offer high-level semantic guidance but struggle to describe complex actions accurately; trajectory-based techniques provide intuitive global motion direction yet often fall short in generating precise or customized character movements; and anchor poses-guided methods are typically confined to synthesize only simple motion patterns. To generate more controllable and precise human motions, we propose \textbf{ProMoGen (Progressive Motion Generation)}, a novel framework that integrates trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion control. Global trajectories ensure consistency in spatial direction and displacement, while sparse anchor motions only deliver precise action guidance without displacement. This decoupling enables independent refinement of both aspects, resulting in a more controllable, high-fidelity, and sophisticated motion synthesis. ProMoGen supports both dual and single control paradigms within a unified training process. Moreover, we recognize that direct learning from sparse motions is inherently unstable, we introduce \textbf{SAP-CL (Sparse Anchor Posture Curriculum Learning)}, a curriculum learning strategy that progressively adjusts the number of anchors used for guidance, thereby enabling more precise and stable convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProMoGen excels in synthesizing vivid and diverse motions guided by predefined trajectory and arbitrary anchor frames. Our approach seamlessly integrates personalized motion with structured guidance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple control scenarios.

Abstract: Memes are widely used for humor and cultural commentary, but they are increasingly exploited to spread hateful content. Due to their multimodal nature, hateful memes often evade traditional text-only or image-only detection systems, particularly when they employ subtle or coded references. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal hate detection framework that integrates key components: OCR to extract embedded text, captioning to describe visual content neutrally, sub-label classification for granular categorization of hateful content, RAG for contextually relevant retrieval, and VQA for iterative analysis of symbolic and contextual cues. This enables the framework to uncover latent signals that simpler pipelines fail to detect. Experimental results on the Facebook Hateful Memes dataset reveal that the proposed framework exceeds the performance of unimodal and conventional multimodal models in both accuracy and AUC-ROC.

<title>V$^2$R-Bench: Holistically Evaluating LVLM Robustness to Fundamental Visual Variations</title>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) excel in various vision-language tasks. Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.

<title>Prompt-Tuning SAM: From Generalist to Specialist with only 2048 Parameters and 16 Training Images</title>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is widely used for segmenting a diverse range of objects in natural images from simple user prompts like points or bounding boxes. However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.

<title>Gaussian Splatting is an Effective Data Generator for 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: We investigate data augmentation for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.
  Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Intraoperative adverse events (IAEs), such as bleeding or thermal injury, can lead to severe postoperative complications if undetected. However, their rarity results in highly imbalanced datasets, posing challenges for AI-based detection and severity quantification. We propose BetaMixer, a novel deep learning model that addresses these challenges through a Beta distribution-based mixing approach, converting discrete IAE severity scores into continuous values for precise severity regression (0-5 scale). BetaMixer employs Beta distribution-based sampling to enhance underrepresented classes and regularizes intermediate embeddings to maintain a structured feature space. A generative approach aligns the feature space with sampled IAE severity, enabling robust classification and severity regression via a transformer. Evaluated on the MultiBypass140 dataset, which we extended with IAE labels, BetaMixer achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.76, recall of 0.81, PPV of 0.73, and NPV of 0.84, demonstrating strong performance on imbalanced data. By integrating Beta distribution-based sampling, feature mixing, and generative modeling, BetaMixer offers a robust solution for IAE detection and quantification in clinical settings.

Abstract: Image description generation is essential for accessibility and AI understanding of visual content. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved natural language processing and computer vision. In this work, we propose Tri-FusionNet, a novel image description generation model that integrates transformer modules: a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder module with dual-attention mechanism, a Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) decoder module, and a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) integrating module. The ViT encoder, enhanced with dual attention, focuses on relevant spatial regions and linguistic context, improving image feature extraction. The RoBERTa decoder is employed to generate precise textual descriptions. CLIP's integrating module aligns visual and textual data through contrastive learning, ensuring effective combination of both modalities. This fusion of ViT, RoBERTa, and CLIP, along with dual attention, enables the model to produce more accurate, contextually rich, and flexible descriptions. The proposed framework demonstrated competitive performance on the Flickr30k and Flickr8k datasets, with BLEU scores ranging from 0.767 to 0.456 and 0.784 to 0.479, CIDEr scores of 1.679 and 1.483, METEOR scores of 0.478 and 0.358, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.567 and 0.789, respectively. On MS-COCO, the framework obtained BLEU scores of 0.893 (B-1), 0.821 (B-2), 0.794 (B-3), and 0.725 (B-4). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Tri-FusionNet in generating high-quality image descriptions.

Abstract: Understanding and analyzing video actions are essential for producing insightful and contextualized descriptions, especially for video-based applications like intelligent monitoring and autonomous systems. The proposed work introduces a novel framework for generating natural language descriptions from video datasets by combining textual and visual modalities. The suggested architecture makes use of ResNet50 to extract visual features from video frames that are taken from the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD), and Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) datasets. The extracted visual characteristics are converted into patch embeddings and then run through an encoder-decoder model based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2). In order to align textual and visual representations and guarantee high-quality description production, the system uses multi-head self-attention and cross-attention techniques. The model's efficacy is demonstrated by performance evaluation using BLEU (1-4), CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. The suggested framework outperforms traditional methods with BLEU-4 scores of 0.755 (BDD-X) and 0.778 (MSVD), CIDEr scores of 1.235 (BDD-X) and 1.315 (MSVD), METEOR scores of 0.312 (BDD-X) and 0.329 (MSVD), and ROUGE-L scores of 0.782 (BDD-X) and 0.795 (MSVD). By producing human-like, contextually relevant descriptions, strengthening interpretability, and improving real-world applications, this research advances explainable AI.

<title>Decoupled Global-Local Alignment for Improving Compositional Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16801</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2504.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA

Abstract: We present an open-source, low-cost photogrammetry system for 3D plant modeling and phenotyping. The system uses a structure-from-motion approach to reconstruct 3D representations of the plants via point clouds. Using wheat as an example, we demonstrate how various phenotypic traits can be computed easily from the point clouds. These include standard measurements such as plant height and radius, as well as features that would be more cumbersome to measure by hand, such as leaf angles and convex hull. We further demonstrate the utility of the system through the investigation of specific metrics that may yield objective classifications of erectophile versus planophile wheat canopy architectures.

<title>Hyperspectral Vision Transformers for Greenhouse Gas Estimations from Space</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral information and holds significant potential for monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, its application is constrained by limited spatial coverage and infrequent revisit times. In contrast, multispectral imaging offers broader spatial and temporal coverage but often lacks the spectral detail that can enhance GHG detection. To address these challenges, this study proposes a spectral transformer model that synthesizes hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs. The model is pre-trained via a band-wise masked autoencoder and subsequently fine-tuned on spatio-temporally aligned multispectral-hyperspectral image pairs. The resulting synthetic hyperspectral data retain the spatial and temporal benefits of multispectral imagery and improve GHG prediction accuracy relative to using multispectral data alone. This approach effectively bridges the trade-off between spectral resolution and coverage, highlighting its potential to advance atmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and multispectral systems with self-supervised deep learning.

Abstract: Addressing gaps caused by cloud cover and the long revisit cycle of satellites is vital for providing essential data to support remote sensing applications. This paper tackles the challenges of missing optical data synthesis, particularly in complex scenarios with cloud cover. We propose CRSynthNet, a novel image synthesis network that incorporates innovative designed modules such as the DownUp Block and Fusion Attention to enhance accuracy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of CRSynthNet, demonstrating substantial improvements in restoring structural details, preserving spectral consist, and achieving superior visual effects that far exceed those produced by comparison methods. It achieves quantitative improvements across multiple metrics: a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 26.978, a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.648, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.050. Furthermore, this study creates the TCSEN12 dataset, a valuable resource specifically designed to address cloud cover challenges in missing optical data synthesis study. The dataset uniquely includes cloud-covered images and leverages earlier image to predict later image, offering a realistic representation of real-world scenarios. This study offer practical method and valuable resources for optical satellite image synthesis task.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generative models have rapidly advanced and found widespread applications across fields like entertainment, education, and marketing. However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse. Our project page is at https://wrt2000.github.io/BadVideo2025/.

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on image customization (e.g., identity, subject, style, background, etc.) demonstrates strong customization capabilities in large-scale generative models. However, most approaches are designed for specific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types of condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization framework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless integration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion transformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types. During training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes various customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to facilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images. Additionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific placeholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the placement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a progressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage focused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a full-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization capabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases introduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with high quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.

Abstract: Many sparse attention mechanisms such as Neighborhood Attention have typically failed to consistently deliver speedup over the self attention baseline. This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention infrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the same time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer vision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape the O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse attention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better analytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce Generalized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window, strided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design choices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can provide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting. Finally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed attention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in CUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically possible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective utilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA configurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B, HunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end speedup on B200 without any fine-tuning. We will open source our simulator and Blackwell kernels directly through the NATTEN project.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are a crucial ingredient for training stereo matching networks, but the question of what makes a stereo dataset effective remains largely unexplored. We investigate the design space of synthetic datasets by varying the parameters of a procedural dataset generator, and report the effects on zero-shot stereo matching performance using standard benchmarks. We collect the best settings to produce Infinigen-Stereo, a procedural generator specifically optimized for zero-shot stereo datasets. Models trained only on data from our system outperform robust baselines trained on a combination of existing synthetic datasets and have stronger zero-shot stereo matching performance than public checkpoints from prior works. We open source our system at https://github.com/princeton-vl/InfinigenStereo to enable further research on procedural stereo datasets.

Abstract: Neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, are challenging to diagnose, particularly in the early stages where symptoms closely resemble healthy controls. Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.

Abstract: This study performs a comprehensive evaluation of quantitative measurements as extracted from automated deep-learning-based segmentation methods, beyond traditional Dice Similarity Coefficient assessments, focusing on six quantitative metrics, namely SUVmax, SUVmean, total lesion activity (TLA), tumor volume (TMTV), lesion count, and lesion spread. We analyzed 380 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, training deep neural networks, U-Net, Attention U-Net and SegResNet with four loss functions: Dice Loss, Dice Cross Entropy, Dice Focal Loss, and our proposed L1 weighted Dice Focal Loss (L1DFL). Evaluations indicated that Attention U-Net paired with L1DFL achieved the strongest correlation with the ground truth (concordance correlation = 0.90-0.99 for SUVmax and TLA), whereas models employing the Dice Loss and the other two compound losses, particularly with SegResNet, underperformed. Equivalence testing (TOST, alpha = 0.05, Delta = 20%) confirmed high performance for SUV metrics, lesion count and TLA, with L1DFL yielding the best performance. By contrast, tumor volume and lesion spread exhibited greater variability. Bland-Altman, Coverage Probability, and Total Deviation Index analyses further highlighted that our proposed L1DFL minimizes variability in quantification of the ground truth clinical measures.

Abstract: At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often destabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

<title>Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation</title>

Abstract: Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.

Abstract: The goal of predictive data attribution is to estimate how adding or removing a given set of training datapoints will affect model predictions. In convex settings, this goal is straightforward (i.e., via the infinitesimal jackknife). In large-scale (non-convex) settings, however, existing methods are far less successful -- current methods' estimates often only weakly correlate with ground truth. In this work, we present a new data attribution method (MAGIC) that combines classical methods and recent advances in metadifferentiation to (nearly) optimally estimate the effect of adding or removing training data on model predictions.

Abstract: As urban 3D scenes become increasingly complex and the demand for high-quality rendering grows, efficient scene reconstruction and rendering techniques become crucial. We present HUG, a novel approach to address inefficiencies in handling large-scale urban environments and intricate details based on 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method optimizes data partitioning and the reconstruction pipeline by incorporating a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We employ an enhanced block-based reconstruction pipeline focusing on improving reconstruction quality within each block and reducing the need for redundant training regions around block boundaries. By integrating neural Gaussian representation with a hierarchical architecture, we achieve high-quality scene rendering at a low computational cost. This is demonstrated by our state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks, which prove the effectiveness and advantages in large-scale urban scene representation.

<title>Representation Learning via Non-Contrastive Mutual Information</title>

Abstract: Labeling data is often very time consuming and expensive, leaving us with a majority of unlabeled data. Self-supervised representation learning methods such as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very successful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image data, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for downstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1) Contrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as BYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information between related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every other data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch sizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance as they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to implement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In this paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the strength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called the Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we convert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise comparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information formulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new objective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by learning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and show that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Arctic is critical to global ecosystem health and navigation safety. However, current methods still is confronted with two challenges: 1) these methods rarely explore the long-term feature dependencies in the frequency domain. 2) they can hardly preserve the high-frequency details, and the changes in the marginal area of the sea ice cannot be accurately captured. To this end, we present a Frequency-Compensated Network (FCNet) for Arctic SIC prediction on a daily basis. In particular, we design a dual-branch network, including branches for frequency feature extraction and convolutional feature extraction. For frequency feature extraction, we design an adaptive frequency filter block, which integrates trainable layers with Fourier-based filters. By adding frequency features, the FCNet can achieve refined prediction of edges and details. For convolutional feature extraction, we propose a high-frequency enhancement block to separate high and low-frequency information. Moreover, high-frequency features are enhanced via channel-wise attention, and temporal attention unit is employed for low-frequency feature extraction to capture long-range sea ice changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a satellite-derived daily SIC dataset, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCNet. Our codes and data will be made public available at: https://github.com/oucailab/FCNet .

Abstract: Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.

Abstract: The examination of chest X-ray images is a crucial component in detecting various thoracic illnesses. This study introduces a new image description generation model that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with cross-modal attention and a GPT-4-based transformer decoder. The ViT captures high-quality visual features from chest X-rays, which are fused with text data through cross-modal attention to improve the accuracy, context, and richness of image descriptions. The GPT-4 decoder transforms these fused features into accurate and relevant captions. The model was tested on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Indiana University (IU) Chest X-ray datasets. On the IU dataset, it achieved scores of 0.854 (B-1), 0.883 (CIDEr), 0.759 (METEOR), and 0.712 (ROUGE-L). On the NIH dataset, it achieved the best performance on all metrics: BLEU 1--4 (0.825, 0.788, 0.765, 0.752), CIDEr (0.857), METEOR (0.726), and ROUGE-L (0.705). This framework has the potential to enhance chest X-ray evaluation, assisting radiologists in more precise and efficient diagnosis.

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.

Abstract: As the field of representation learning grows, there has been a proliferation of different loss functions to solve different classes of problems. We introduce a single information-theoretic equation that generalizes a large collection of modern loss functions in machine learning. In particular, we introduce a framework that shows that several broad classes of machine learning methods are precisely minimizing an integrated KL divergence between two conditional distributions: the supervisory and learned representations. This viewpoint exposes a hidden information geometry underlying clustering, spectral methods, dimensionality reduction, contrastive learning, and supervised learning. This framework enables the development of new loss functions by combining successful techniques from across the literature. We not only present a wide array of proofs, connecting over 23 different approaches, but we also leverage these theoretical results to create state-of-the-art unsupervised image classifiers that achieve a +8% improvement over the prior state-of-the-art on unsupervised classification on ImageNet-1K. We also demonstrate that I-Con can be used to derive principled debiasing methods which improve contrastive representation learners.

Abstract: We study complex-valued scaling as a type of symmetry natural and unique to complex-valued measurements and representations. Deep Complex Networks (DCN) extends real-valued algebra to the complex domain without addressing complex-valued scaling. SurReal takes a restrictive manifold view of complex numbers, adopting a distance metric to achieve complex-scaling invariance while losing rich complex-valued information. We analyze complex-valued scaling as a co-domain transformation and design novel equivariant and invariant neural network layer functions for this special transformation. We also propose novel complex-valued representations of RGB images, where complex-valued scaling indicates hue shift or correlated changes across color channels. Benchmarked on MSTAR, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN, our co-domain symmetric (CDS) classifiers deliver higher accuracy, better generalization, robustness to co-domain transformations, and lower model bias and variance than DCN and SurReal with far fewer parameters.

Abstract: Existing hands datasets are largely short-range and the interaction is weak due to the self-occlusion and self-similarity of hands, which can not yet fit the need for interacting hands motion generation. To rescue the data scarcity, we propose HandDiffuse12.5M, a novel dataset that consists of temporal sequences with strong two-hand interactions. HandDiffuse12.5M has the largest scale and richest interactions among the existing two-hand datasets. We further present a strong baseline method HandDiffuse for the controllable motion generation of interacting hands using various controllers. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model as the backbone and design two motion representations for different controllers. To reduce artifacts, we also propose Interaction Loss which explicitly quantifies the dynamic interaction process. Our HandDiffuse enables various applications with vivid two-hand interactions, i.e., motion in-betweening and trajectory control. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in motion generation and can also contribute to data augmentation for other datasets. Our dataset, corresponding codes, and pre-trained models will be disseminated to the community for future research towards two-hand interaction modeling.

Abstract: Lymph node (LN) assessment is a critical, indispensable yet very challenging task in the routine clinical workflow of radiology and oncology. Accurate LN analysis is essential for cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Finding scatteredly distributed, low-contrast clinically relevant LNs in 3D CT is difficult even for experienced physicians under high inter-observer variations. Previous automatic LN detection works typically yield limited recall and high false positives (FPs) due to adjacent anatomies with similar image intensities, shapes, or textures (vessels, muscles, esophagus, etc). In this work, we propose a new LN DEtection TRansformer, named LN-DETR, to achieve more accurate performance. By enhancing the 2D backbone with a multi-scale 2.5D feature fusion to incorporate 3D context explicitly, more importantly, we make two main contributions to improve the representation quality of LN queries. 1) Considering that LN boundaries are often unclear, an IoU prediction head and a location debiased query selection are proposed to select LN queries of higher localization accuracy as the decoder query's initialization. 2) To reduce FPs, query contrastive learning is employed to explicitly reinforce LN queries towards their best-matched ground-truth queries over unmatched query predictions. Trained and tested on 3D CT scans of 1067 patients (with 10,000+ labeled LNs) via combining seven LN datasets from different body parts (neck, chest, and abdomen) and pathologies/cancers, our method significantly improves the performance of previous leading methods by > 4-5% average recall at the same FP rates in both internal and external testing. We further evaluate on the universal lesion detection task using NIH DeepLesion benchmark, and our method achieves the top performance of 88.46% averaged recall across 0.5 to 4 FPs per image, compared with other leading reported results.

Abstract: For vision-language models (VLMs), understanding the dynamic properties of objects and their interactions in 3D scenes from videos is crucial for effective reasoning about high-level temporal and action semantics. Although humans are adept at understanding these properties by constructing 3D and temporal (4D) representations of the world, current video understanding models struggle to extract these dynamic semantics, arguably because these models use cross-frame reasoning without underlying knowledge of the 3D/4D scenes. In this work, we introduce DynSuperCLEVR, the first video question answering dataset that focuses on language understanding of the dynamic properties of 3D objects. We concentrate on three physical concepts -- velocity, acceleration, and collisions within 4D scenes. We further generate three types of questions, including factual queries, future predictions, and counterfactual reasoning that involve different aspects of reasoning about these 4D dynamic properties. To further demonstrate the importance of explicit scene representations in answering these 4D dynamics questions, we propose NS-4DPhysics, a Neural-Symbolic VideoQA model integrating Physics prior for 4D dynamic properties with explicit scene representation of videos. Instead of answering the questions directly from the video text input, our method first estimates the 4D world states with a 3D generative model powered by physical priors, and then uses neural symbolic reasoning to answer the questions based on the 4D world states. Our evaluation on all three types of questions in DynSuperCLEVR shows that previous video question answering models and large multimodal models struggle with questions about 4D dynamics, while our NS-4DPhysics significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. Our code and data are released in https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/DynSuperCLEVR/.

Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) methods based on appearance matching has long suffered from insufficient appearance information incurred by incomplete, textureless and semantically deficient LiDAR point clouds. While motion paradigm exploits motion cues instead of appearance matching for tracking, it incurs complex multi-stage processing and segmentation module. In this paper, we first provide in-depth explorations on motion paradigm, which proves that (\textbf{i}) it is feasible to directly infer target relative motion from point clouds across consecutive frames; (\textbf{ii}) fine-grained information comparison between consecutive point clouds facilitates target motion modeling. We thereby propose to perform part-to-part motion modeling for consecutive point clouds and introduce a novel tracking framework, termed \textbf{P2P}. The novel framework fuses each corresponding part information between consecutive point clouds, effectively exploring detailed information changes and thus modeling accurate target-related motion cues. Following this framework, we present P2P-point and P2P-voxel models, incorporating implicit and explicit part-to-part motion modeling by point- and voxel-based representation, respectively. Without bells and whistles, P2P-voxel sets a new state-of-the-art performance ($\sim$\textbf{89\%}, \textbf{72\%} and \textbf{63\%} precision on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, respectively). Moreover, under the same point-based representation, P2P-point outperforms the previous motion tracker M$^2$Track by \textbf{3.3\%} and \textbf{6.7\%} on the KITTI and NuScenes, while running at a considerably high speed of \textbf{107 Fps} on a single RTX3090 GPU.

Abstract: Artistic style includes both structural and appearance elements. Existing neural stylization techniques primarily focus on transferring appearance features such as color and texture, often neglecting the equally crucial aspect of structural stylization. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the simultaneous stylization of structure and appearance of 2D images. Specifically, we introduce DiffArtist, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first stylization method to allow for dual controllability over structure and appearance. Our key insight is to represent structure and appearance as separate diffusion processes to achieve complete disentanglement without requiring any training, thereby endowing users with unprecedented controllability for both components. The evaluation of stylization of both appearance and structure, however, remains challenging as it necessitates semantic understanding. To this end, we further propose a Multimodal LLM-based style evaluator, which better aligns with human preferences than metrics lacking semantic understanding. With this powerful evaluator, we conduct extensive analysis, demonstrating that DiffArtist achieves superior style fidelity, editability, and structure-appearance disentanglement. These merits make DiffArtist a highly versatile solution for creative applications. Project homepage: https://github.com/songrise/Artist.

Abstract: This paper proposes Pix2Next, a novel image-to-image translation framework designed to address the challenge of generating high-quality Near-Infrared (NIR) images from RGB inputs. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.

Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured environments require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings, necessitating geometric and semantic information from sensor data. Traditional RGB-D processing pipelines focus primarily on geometric reconstruction, limiting their ability to support advanced robotic perception, planning, and interaction. A key challenge is the lack of generalized methods for segmenting RGB-D data into semantically meaningful components while maintaining accurate geometric representations. We introduce a novel end-to-end modular pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, human tracking, point-cloud fusion, and scene reconstruction. Our approach improves semantic segmentation accuracy by leveraging the foundational segmentation model SAM2 with a hybrid method that combines its mask generation with a semantic classification model, resulting in sharper masks and high classification accuracy. Compared to SegFormer and OneFormer, our method achieves a similar semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU of 47.0% vs 45.9% in the ADE20K dataset) but provides much more precise object boundaries. Additionally, our human tracking algorithm interacts with the segmentation enabling continuous tracking even when objects leave and re-enter the frame by object re-identification. Our point cloud fusion approach reduces computation time by 1.81x while maintaining a small mean reconstruction error of 25.3 mm by leveraging the semantic information. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets and real-world Kinect RGB-D data, demonstrating improved efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Our structured representation, stored in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, supports efficient querying, visualization, and robotic simulation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in face restoration. Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/jkwang28/OSDFace.

<title>Critic-V: VLM Critics Help Catch VLM Errors in Multimodal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.

<title>Dynamic EventNeRF: Reconstructing General Dynamic Scenes from Multi-view RGB and Event Streams</title>

Abstract: Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in computer vision. It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras. The code and the data will be released soon at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/DynEventNeRF/

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for advancing CL.

Abstract: Stereo matching is a key technique for metric depth estimation in computer vision and robotics. Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks, further demonstrating its outstanding capabilities.

Abstract: Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) scenes is one of the most important issues in camera design. Majority of cameras use exposure fusion, which fuses images captured by different exposure levels, to increase dynamic range. However, this approach can only handle images with limited exposure difference, normally 3-4 stops. When applying to very high dynamic range scenes where a large exposure difference is required, this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or inconsistent lighting between inputs, or tone mapping artifacts. In this work, we propose \model, the first exposure fusion technique that can merge inputs with 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model exposure fusion as a guided inpainting problem, where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance to fill the missing information of over-exposed highlights in the over-exposed region. Using an under-exposed image as a soft guidance, instead of a hard constraint, our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting variations. Moreover, by utilizing the image prior of the generative model, our model also generates natural tone mapping, even for very high-dynamic range scenes. Our approach outperforms HDR-Transformer on latest HDR benchmarks. Moreover, to test its performance in ultra high dynamic range scenes, we capture a new real-world exposure fusion benchmark, UltraFusion dataset, with exposure differences up to 9 stops, and experiments show that UltraFusion can generate beautiful and high-quality fusion results under various scenarios. Code and data will be available at https://openimaginglab.github.io/UltraFusion.

Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity lip-speech synchronization in audio-driven talking portrait synthesis remains challenging. While multi-stage pipelines or diffusion models yield high-quality results, they suffer from high computational costs. Some approaches perform well on specific individuals with low resources, yet still exhibit mismatched lip movements. The aforementioned methods are modeled in the pixel domain. We observed that there are noticeable discrepancies in the frequency domain between the synthesized talking videos and natural videos. Currently, no research on talking portrait synthesis has considered this aspect. To address this, we propose a FREquency-modulated, high-fidelity, and real-time Audio-driven talKing portrait synthesis framework, named FREAK, which models talking portraits from the frequency domain perspective, enhancing the fidelity and naturalness of the synthesized portraits. FREAK introduces two novel frequency-based modules: 1) the Visual Encoding Frequency Modulator (VEFM) to couple multi-scale visual features in the frequency domain, better preserving visual frequency information and reducing the gap in the frequency spectrum between synthesized and natural frames. and 2) the Audio Visual Frequency Modulator (AVFM) to help the model learn the talking pattern in the frequency domain and improve audio-visual synchronization. Additionally, we optimize the model in both pixel domain and frequency domain jointly. Furthermore, FREAK supports seamless switching between one-shot and video dubbing settings, offering enhanced flexibility. Due to its superior performance, it can simultaneously support high-resolution video results and real-time inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method synthesizes high-fidelity talking portraits with detailed facial textures and precise lip synchronization in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a transformative model paradigm, significantly impacting various fields. However, their adversarial robustness remains less underexplored, especially across different KAN architectures. To explore this critical safety issue, we conduct an analysis and find that due to overfitting to the specific basis functions of KANs, they possess poor adversarial transferability among different KANs. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdvKAN, the first transfer attack method for KANs. AdvKAN integrates two key components: 1) a Breakthrough-Defense Surrogate Model (BDSM), which employs a breakthrough-defense training strategy to mitigate overfitting to the specific structures of KANs. 2) a Global-Local Interaction (GLI) technique, which promotes sufficient interaction between adversarial gradients of hierarchical levels, further smoothing out loss surfaces of KANs. Both of them work together to enhance the strength of transfer attack among different KANs. Extensive experimental results on various KANs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvKAN, which possesses notably superior attack capabilities and deeply reveals the vulnerabilities of KANs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial-temporal reasoning, effortlessly interpreting dynamic visual events from an egocentric viewpoint. However, whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can similarly understand the 4D world remains uncertain. This paper explores multimodal spatial-temporal reasoning from an egocentric perspective, aiming to equip MLLMs with human-like reasoning capabilities. To support this objective, we introduce \textbf{Ego-ST Bench}, a novel benchmark containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs across four categories, systematically evaluating spatial, temporal, and integrated spatial-temporal reasoning. Additionally, we propose \textbf{ST-R1} training paradigm, a video-based reasoning model that incorporates reverse thinking into its reinforcement learning process, significantly enhancing performance. We combine long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, achieving notable improvements with limited high-quality data. Ego-ST Bench and ST-R1 provide valuable insights and resources for advancing video-based spatial-temporal reasoning research.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating visually compelling images following user prompts. Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.

Abstract: We explore the symmetry of the mean k x k weight kernel in each layer of various convolutional neural networks. Unlike individual neurons, the mean kernels in internal layers tend to be symmetric about their centers instead of favoring specific directions. We investigate why this symmetry emerges in various datasets and models, and how it is impacted by certain architectural choices. We show how symmetry correlates with desirable properties such as shift and flip consistency, and might constitute an inherent inductive bias in convolutional neural networks.

Abstract: Videos inherently contain multiple modalities, including visual events, text overlays, sounds, and speech, all of which are important for retrieval. However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.

Abstract: Capturing high-quality photographs under diverse real-world lighting conditions is challenging, as both natural lighting (e.g., low-light) and camera exposure settings (e.g., exposure time) significantly impact image quality. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception, existing methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on accurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.

Abstract: The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients presenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected AAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority of suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging testing, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT for AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy and provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated through a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study (n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various non-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a specificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846), iAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct diagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted, iAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584 consecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT protocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic time of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the iAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where non-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in resource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive intravenous contrast.

Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks have achieved thrilling breakthroughs in the past decade, data augmentations have garnered increasing attention as regularization techniques when massive labeled data are unavailable. Among existing augmentations, Mixup and relevant data-mixing methods that convexly combine selected samples and the corresponding labels are widely adopted because they yield high performances by generating data-dependent virtual data while easily migrating to various domains. This survey presents a comprehensive review of foundational mixup methods and their applications. We first elaborate on the training pipeline with mixup augmentations as a unified framework containing modules. A reformulated framework could contain various mixup methods and give intuitive operational procedures. Then, we systematically investigate the applications of mixup augmentations on vision downstream tasks, various data modalities, and some analysis \& theorems of mixup. Meanwhile, we conclude the current status and limitations of mixup research and point out further work for effective and efficient mixup augmentations. This survey can provide researchers with the current state of the art in mixup methods and provide some insights and guidance roles in the mixup arena. An online project with this survey is available at https://github.com/Westlake-AI/Awesome-Mixup.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness around the world and demands precise AI-based diagnostic tools. Traditional loss functions in multi-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very common but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently challenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive models. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher severity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very early stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we propose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of focal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on minority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art models applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good performance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at 99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and InceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes enhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in mixed-modal generative have opened new avenues for developing unified biomedical assistants capable of analyzing biomedical images, answering complex questions about them, and generating multimodal patient reports. However, existing datasets face challenges such as small sizes, limited coverage of biomedical tasks and domains, and a reliance on narrow sources. To address these gaps, we present MedMax, a large-scale multimodal biomedical instruction-tuning dataset for mixed-modal foundation models. With 1.47 million instances, MedMax encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including interleaved image-text generation, biomedical image captioning and generation, visual chat, and report understanding. These tasks span knowledge across diverse biomedical domains, including radiology and histopathology, grounded in medical papers and YouTube videos. Subsequently, we fine-tune a mixed-modal foundation model on the MedMax dataset, achieving significant performance improvements: a 26% gain over the Chameleon model and an 18.3% improvement over GPT-4o across 12 downstream biomedical visual question-answering tasks. Finally, we introduce a unified evaluation suite for biomedical tasks to guide the development of mixed-modal biomedical AI assistants. The data, model, and code is available at https://mint-medmax.github.io/.

<title>X-SG$^2$S: Safe and Generalizable Gaussian Splatting with X-dimensional Watermarks</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been widely used in 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.

Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/

<title>CF-CAM: Cluster Filter Class Activation Mapping for Reliable Gradient-Based Interpretability</title>

arXiv:2504.00060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning continues to advance, the transparency of neural network decision-making remains a critical challenge, limiting trust and applicability in high-stakes domains. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach toward visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations due to gradient noise, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM) technique, a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM utilizes hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering method via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages Gaussian filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while enhancing computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a competitive solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

<title>Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone.
  Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification.
  Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models.
  Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models.
  Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: The personalized text-to-image generation has rapidly advanced with the emergence of Stable Diffusion. Existing methods, which typically fine-tune models using embedded identifiers, often struggle with insufficient stylization and inaccurate image content due to reduced textual controllability. In this paper, we propose style refinement and content preservation strategies. The style refinement strategy leverages the semantic information of visual reasoning prompts and reference images to optimize style embeddings, allowing a more precise and consistent representation of style information. The content preservation strategy addresses the content bias problem by preserving the model's generalization capabilities, ensuring enhanced textual controllability without compromising stylization. Experimental results verify that our approach achieves superior performance in generating consistent and personalized text-to-image outputs.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a new synthetic dataset called LongPerceptualThoughts consisting of 30K long-thought traces for perceptual tasks. They address the challenge of synthesizing elaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks by proposing a three-stage data synthesis framework. This framework generates multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions, extracts simple Chains of Thoughts (CoTs) from Very Large Models (VLMs), and expands these simple thoughts into elaborate long thoughts using frontier reasoning models. Through experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, they demonstrate significant improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation methods. The model trained on the generated dataset shows average improvements of +3.4 points across five vision-centric benchmarks and notably enhances performance on the text reasoning benchmark MMLU-Pro by +2 points. <div>

Abstract: Recent reasoning models through test-time scaling have demonstrated that long chain-of-thoughts can unlock substantial performance boosts in hard reasoning tasks such as math and code. However, the benefit of such long thoughts for system-2 reasoning is relatively less explored in other domains such as perceptual tasks where shallower, system-1 reasoning seems sufficient. In this paper, we introduce LongPerceptualThoughts, a new synthetic dataset with 30K long-thought traces for perceptual tasks. The key challenges in synthesizing elaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks are that off-the-shelf models are not yet equipped with such thinking behavior and that it is not straightforward to build a reliable process verifier for perceptual tasks. Thus, we propose a novel three-stage data synthesis framework that first synthesizes verifiable multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions, then extracts simple CoTs from VLMs for those verifiable problems, and finally expands those simple thoughts to elaborate long thoughts via frontier reasoning models. In controlled experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, we demonstrate notable improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation methods. Our model, trained on the generated dataset, achieves an average +3.4 points improvement over 5 vision-centric benchmarks, including +11.8 points on V$^*$ Bench. Notably, despite being tuned for vision tasks, it also improves performance on the text reasoning benchmark, MMLU-Pro, by +2 points.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges posed by neuromorphic event cameras, which output asynchronous, sparse, and irregular events not easily compatible with traditional computer vision and deep learning methods. To address this issue, the concept of event2vec is introduced, inspired by the word to vector approach in natural language processing. Event2vec demonstrates impressive parameter efficiency, accuracy, and speed in classifying the ASL-DVS dataset compared to existing representations. Moreover, it aligns events with language processing, offering potential integration with large language and multimodal models.

Abstract: The neuromorphic event cameras have overwhelming advantages in temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, the event cameras output asynchronous, sparse, and irregular events, which are not compatible with mainstream computer vision and deep learning methods. Various methods have been proposed to solve this issue but at the cost of long preprocessing procedures, losing temporal resolutions, or being incompatible with massively parallel computation. Inspired by the great success of the word to vector, we summarize the similarities between words and events, then propose the first event to vector (event2vec) representation. We validate event2vec on classifying the ASL-DVS dataset, showing impressive parameter efficiency, accuracy, and speed than previous graph/image/voxel-based representations. Beyond task performance, the most attractive advantage of event2vec is that it aligns events to the domain of natural language processing, showing the promising prospect of integrating events into large language and multimodal models. Our codes, models, and training logs are available at https://github.com/fangwei123456/event2vec.

It includes a taxonomy of camera motion primitives developed with cinematographers, showing that some motions require understanding scene content. A human study found that expertise and training enhance annotation accuracy.

Fine-tuning a generative VLM on the dataset yielded improved performance, showcasing applications like motion-augmented captioning and video question answering. The taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials provided aim to advance efforts in comprehending camera motions in videos. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.

Summary:
This article introduces a method for automatically generating physically realistic scenes for simulation using satellite imagery. The technique leverages satellite imagery to model scene geometry, drive material estimates, and populate scenes with dynamic elements. By utilizing automated techniques and not relying on lidar data, the process expedites scene construction and reduces manual overhead. The approach involves modeling terrain, man-made structures, vegetation, and vehicles based on a Digital Surface Model of the real location. These simulations enable higher fidelity representations of novel earth locations and support algorithm development for imagery across a wide range of wavelengths. <div>

Abstract: Physics driven image simulation allows for the modeling and creation of realistic imagery beyond what is afforded by typical rendering pipelines. We aim to automatically generate a physically realistic scene for simulation of a given region using satellite imagery to model the scene geometry, drive material estimates, and populate the scene with dynamic elements. We present automated techniques to utilize satellite imagery throughout the simulated scene to expedite scene construction and decrease manual overhead. Our technique does not use lidar, enabling simulations that could not be constructed previously. To develop a 3D scene, we model the various components of the real location, addressing the terrain, modelling man-made structures, and populating the scene with smaller elements such as vegetation and vehicles. To create the scene we begin with a Digital Surface Model, which serves as the basis for scene geometry, and allows us to reason about the real location in a common 3D frame of reference. These simulated scenes can provide increased fidelity with less manual intervention for novel locations on earth, and can facilitate algorithm development, and processing pipelines for imagery ranging from UV to LWIR $(200nm-20\mu m)$.

The article introduces a versatile codec-aware enhancement framework designed to enhance videos that have undergone compression. The framework consists of a Compression-Aware Adaptation (CAA) network that uses a hierarchical mechanism to estimate parameters for a Frame-Wise Enhancement Network called the Bitstream-Aware Enhancement (BAE) network. By utilizing temporal and spatial priors embedded in the bitstream, the BAE network effectively improves the quality of compressed input frames. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this framework compared to existing methods in enhancing video quality and its versatility in assisting multiple downstream tasks on compressed videos. The framework is designed as a plug-and-play module, allowing for easy integration into various vision models. The code and models for this framework are available for public use. <div>

Abstract: As a widely adopted technique in data transmission, video compression effectively reduces the size of files, making it possible for real-time cloud computing. However, it comes at the cost of visual quality, posing challenges to the robustness of downstream vision models. In this work, we present a versatile codec-aware enhancement framework that reuses codec information to adaptively enhance videos under different compression settings, assisting various downstream vision tasks without introducing computation bottleneck. Specifically, the proposed codec-aware framework consists of a compression-aware adaptation (CAA) network that employs a hierarchical adaptation mechanism to estimate parameters of the frame-wise enhancement network, namely the bitstream-aware enhancement (BAE) network. The BAE network further leverages temporal and spatial priors embedded in the bitstream to effectively improve the quality of compressed input frames. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior quality enhancement performance of our framework over existing enhancement methods, as well as its versatility in assisting multiple downstream tasks on compressed videos as a plug-and-play module.

By transforming DXA images into graphs and analyzing radiomic features of specific regions, the method achieved a high sensitivity of 0.9869 in predicting hip fractures among 547 subjects from the UK Biobank dataset. This novel approach offers a promising tool for early detection of individuals at risk for hip fractures, crucial for effective intervention to improve mobility and reduce mortality rates among the elderly. <div>

Abstract: Hip fractures represent a major health concern, particularly among the elderly, often leading decreased mobility and increased mortality. Early and accurate detection of at risk individuals is crucial for effective intervention. In this study, we propose Iterative Cross Graph Matching for Hip Fracture Risk Assessment (ICGM-FRAX), a novel approach for predicting hip fractures using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) images. ICGM-FRAX involves iteratively comparing a test (subject) graph with multiple template graphs representing the characteristics of hip fracture subjects to assess the similarity and accurately to predict hip fracture risk. These graphs are obtained as follows. The DXA images are separated into multiple regions of interest (RoIs), such as the femoral head, shaft, and lesser trochanter. Radiomic features are then calculated for each RoI, with the central coordinates used as nodes in a graph. The connectivity between nodes is established according to the Euclidean distance between these coordinates. This process transforms each DXA image into a graph, where each node represents a RoI, and edges derived by the centroids of RoIs capture the spatial relationships between them. If the test graph closely matches a set of template graphs representing subjects with incident hip fractures, it is classified as indicating high hip fracture risk. We evaluated our method using 547 subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, and experimental results show that ICGM-FRAX achieved a sensitivity of 0.9869, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting hip fractures.

<div> diffusion models, image editing, mirror reflections, generative models, synthetic datasets<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Diffusion models used in image editing often struggle to accurately capture physical phenomena like shadows and reflections. This paper introduces a method for generating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. By enhancing synthetic data with random object positioning, rotations, and grounding, the model is able to generalize across different object orientations and positions relative to the mirror. Additionally, a strategy is implemented to pair objects during dataset generation to handle scenes with multiple objects and spatial relationships. A three-stage training curriculum is introduced to improve the model's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of the approach. Visit the project page for more information: https://mirror-verse.github.io/. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have become central to various image editing tasks, yet they often fail to fully adhere to physical laws, particularly with effects like shadows, reflections, and occlusions. In this work, we address the challenge of generating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently overlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent approaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and framing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to generalize across different object orientations and positions relative to the mirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations into the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized rotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization across poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and occlusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair objects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to handle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes remains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to develop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance. We provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to support our approach. The project page is available at: https://mirror-verse.github.io/.

<div> Domain Shift, Contextual Bias, Source Free Object Detection, Medical Imaging, Grounded Teacher<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on solving the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem in medical imaging when source data is unavailable for adaptation. The proposed approach, Grounded Teacher (GT), addresses context imbalance and domain shifts by using a relational context module to capture contextual relationships. This helps in mitigating biases and improving the student model's performance. The GT framework applies augmentations to closely related classes to enhance underrepresented classes' performance while minimizing the impact on dominant classes. Additionally, an expert foundational branch supervises the student model to improve prediction quality. The effectiveness of the GT approach in mitigating context bias in SFOD is validated through experiments on three medical datasets, supported by comprehensive ablation studies. Resources including preprocessed data, trained model weights, and code are available on GitHub for reproducibility. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We focus on the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem, when source data is unavailable during adaptation, and the model must adapt to the unlabeled target domain. In medical imaging, several approaches have leveraged a semi-supervised student-teacher architecture to bridge domain discrepancy. Context imbalance in labeled training data and significant domain shifts between domains can lead to biased teacher models that produce inaccurate pseudolabels, degrading the student model's performance and causing a mode collapse. Class imbalance, particularly when one class significantly outnumbers another, leads to contextual bias. To tackle the problem of context bias and the significant performance drop of the student model in the SFOD setting, we introduce Grounded Teacher (GT) as a standard framework. In this study, we model contextual relationships using a dedicated relational context module and leverage it to mitigate inherent biases in the model. This approach enables us to apply augmentations to closely related classes, across and within domains, enhancing the performance of underrepresented classes while keeping the effect on dominant classes minimal. We further improve the quality of predictions by implementing an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating context bias under the SFOD setting through experiments on three medical datasets supported by comprehensive ablation studies.

Summary:
Existing evaluation frameworks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on image reasoning or general video understanding tasks. However, the significant role of image context in video comprehension is often overlooked. To address this gap, IV-Bench is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning. The benchmark includes 967 videos with 2,585 annotated image-text queries spanning 13 tasks and 5 categories. State-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs were evaluated on IV-Bench, showing underperformance with a maximum accuracy of 28.9%. Factors influencing model performance include inference pattern, frame number, and resolution. Challenges in IV-Bench go beyond data format alignment in training. The findings provide insights for future research, and the codes and data are available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Existing evaluation frameworks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on image reasoning or general video understanding tasks, largely overlooking the significant role of image context in video comprehension. To bridge this gap, we propose IV-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning. IV-Bench consists of 967 videos paired with 2,585 meticulously annotated image-text queries across 13 tasks (7 perception and 6 reasoning tasks) and 5 representative categories. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open-source (e.g., InternVL2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini2-Flash and Gemini2-Pro) MLLMs demonstrate that current models substantially underperform in image-grounded video Perception and Reasoning, merely achieving at most 28.9% accuracy. Further analysis reveals key factors influencing model performance on IV-Bench, including inference pattern, frame number, and resolution. Additionally, through a simple data synthesis approach, we demonstratethe challenges of IV- Bench extend beyond merely aligning the data format in the training proecss. These findings collectively provide valuable insights for future research. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/IV-Bench.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach to distinguishing between real and AI-generated images, known as 'image detection', through zero-shot and few-shot solutions. The method is based on understanding and quantifying biases in generated content by analyzing the biases of the implicit probability manifold captured by a pre-trained diffusion model. By utilizing score-function analysis, the approach approximates curvature, gradient, and bias towards points on the probability manifold, establishing criteria for detection in the zero-shot regime. The method is further extended to the few-shot setting using a mixture-of-experts methodology. Empirical results across 20 generative models show that this approach outperforms current methods in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. This work contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding and practical application of generated content biases through manifold analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Distinguishing between real and AI-generated images, commonly referred to as 'image detection', presents a timely and significant challenge. Despite extensive research in the (semi-)supervised regime, zero-shot and few-shot solutions have only recently emerged as promising alternatives. Their main advantage is in alleviating the ongoing data maintenance, which quickly becomes outdated due to advances in generative technologies. We identify two main gaps: (1) a lack of theoretical grounding for the methods, and (2) significant room for performance improvements in zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our approach is founded on understanding and quantifying the biases inherent in generated content, where we use these quantities as criteria for characterizing generated images. Specifically, we explore the biases of the implicit probability manifold, captured by a pre-trained diffusion model. Through score-function analysis, we approximate the curvature, gradient, and bias towards points on the probability manifold, establishing criteria for detection in the zero-shot regime. We further extend our contribution to the few-shot setting by employing a mixture-of-experts methodology. Empirical results across 20 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. This work advances the theoretical understanding and practical usage of generated content biases through the lens of manifold analysis.

arXiv:2504.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from noise through a process called reverse diffusion. Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.

<div> occluded objects, reasoning, visual patterns, spatial understanding, vision-language models
Summary:
- Introduces CAPTURe task for evaluating models' ability to reason about occluded objects and count patterns.
- CAPTURe consists of CAPTURe-real with real object images and CAPTURe-synthetic with generated images.
- Strong VLMs struggle to count on occluded and unoccluded patterns, indicating difficulty in spatial inference.
- Humans perform well on CAPTURe, while models like GPT-4o exhibit errors with occlusion.
- Providing auxiliary information of occluded objects' locations enhances model performance, highlighting difficulties in handling occlusion and counting in images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.

Abstract: Image enhancement finds wide-ranging applications in real-world scenarios due to complex environments and the inherent limitations of imaging devices. Recent diffusion-based methods yield promising outcomes but necessitate prolonged and computationally intensive iterative sampling. In response, we propose InstaRevive, a straightforward yet powerful image enhancement framework that employs score-based diffusion distillation to harness potent generative capability and minimize the sampling steps. To fully exploit the potential of the pre-trained diffusion model, we devise a practical and effective diffusion distillation pipeline using dynamic control to address inaccuracies in updating direction during score matching. Our control strategy enables a dynamic diffusing scope, facilitating precise learning of denoising trajectories within the diffusion model and ensuring accurate distribution matching gradients during training. Additionally, to enrich guidance for the generative power, we incorporate textual prompts via image captioning as auxiliary conditions, fostering further exploration of the diffusion model. Extensive experiments substantiate the efficacy of our framework across a diverse array of challenging tasks and datasets, unveiling the compelling efficacy and efficiency of InstaRevive in delivering high-quality and visually appealing results.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel multi-modal data fusion framework for real-time forecasting of food drying readiness. By integrating in-situ video data with process parameters, the proposed model accurately predicts time-to-ready for sugar cookie drying, achieving an average prediction error of only 15 seconds. The framework utilizes a new encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific encoders and a transformer-based decoder to effectively extract features and preserve the unique structure of each modality. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data fusion methods and a video-only model. The model strikes a balance between prediction accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for heterogeneous industrial datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be extended to various other industrial modality fusion tasks for online decision-making.

Abstract: Food drying is essential for food production, extending shelf life, and reducing transportation costs. Accurate real-time forecasting of drying readiness is crucial for minimizing energy consumption, improving productivity, and ensuring product quality. However, this remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of drying, limited data availability, and the lack of effective predictive analytical methods. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal data fusion framework that integrates in-situ video data with process parameters for real-time food drying readiness forecasting. Our approach leverages a new encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific encoders and a transformer-based decoder to effectively extract features while preserving the unique structure of each modality. We apply our approach to sugar cookie drying, where time-to-ready is predicted at each timestamp. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an average prediction error of only 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art data fusion methods by 65.69% and a video-only model by 11.30%. Additionally, our model balances prediction accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for heterogenous industrial datasets. The proposed model is extensible to various other industrial modality fusion tasks for online decision-making.

Summary:
Underwater observation systems often use optical cameras and imaging sonar systems, with sonar systems being crucial in low visibility conditions. To improve underwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT), the authors introduce the SonarT165 benchmark, including various sequences and annotations. They propose the STFTrack framework, featuring the multi-view template fusion module (MTFM) and the optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM) to enhance tracking accuracy. The MTFM utilizes multi-view features and a cross-attention layer for spatio-temporal target representation fusion, while the OTCM introduces normalized pixel brightness response scores to improve tracking precision. Additionally, STFTrack incorporates acoustic image enhancement and a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) for better feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate STFTrack's superior performance on the SonarT165 benchmark, showcasing its efficacy in acoustic object tracking applications. The code for STFTrack is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater observation systems typically integrate optical cameras and imaging sonar systems. When underwater visibility is insufficient, only sonar systems can provide stable data, which necessitates exploration of the underwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT) task. Previous studies have explored traditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these methods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT benchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and 205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165 reveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these limitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object tracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module (MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module integrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image of the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse the spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the acoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel brightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by inaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes. To further improve the model feature, STFTrack introduces a acoustic image enhancement method and a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) into its tracking pipeline. Comprehensive experiments show the proposed STFTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/SonarT165.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called HS-Mamba for hyperspectral image classification, addressing challenges related to high dimensionality and feature inlining. HS-Mamba combines local and global feature representation by utilizing a dual-channel spatial-spectral encoder module and a lightweight global inline attention branch. The DCSS-encoder module decouples and models local features using multiple groups of Mamba while the LGI-Att branch enhances global feature representation using a compressed and extended attention module. By fusing local and global features, HS-Mamba achieves high-precision classification of hyperspectral images. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the superiority of HS-Mamba over existing methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has been one of the hot topics in remote sensing fields. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on selective state-space models (S6) has demonstrated great advantages in long sequence modeling. However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high dimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of Mamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose an full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts a strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines the advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to multi-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local inline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is sent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature representation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel spatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline attention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of Mamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with non-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and extended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and spectral domains of the unsegmented whole image. By fusing local and global features, high-precision classification of hyperspectral images is achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HS-Mamba, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark HSI datasets.

<div> Keywords: Preference Alignment, Direct Preference Optimization, Visual Context, Adaptive Optimization, Multimodal Large Language Models

Summary:
Preference Alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown effectiveness in aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences. However, existing methods lack consideration of the visual context. To address this, Adaptive Vision-enhanced Preference optimization (AdaViP) introduces vision-based preference pair construction and adaptive preference optimization. The vision-based approach strategically removes key visual elements from images, enhancing MLLMs' sensitivity to visual details. The adaptive optimization dynamically balances vision- and language-based preferences for more accurate alignment. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of AdaViP, with AdaViP-7B achieving significant reductions in response-level and mentioned-level hallucination on the Object HalBench compared to current state-of-the-art methods (93.7% and 96.4% reductions respectively). <div>

Abstract: Preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences. However, existing methods focus primarily on language preferences while neglecting the critical visual context. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Vision-enhanced Preference optimization (AdaViP) that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) vision-based preference pair construction, which integrates multiple visual foundation models to strategically remove key visual elements from the image, enhancing MLLMs' sensitivity to visual details; and (2) adaptive preference optimization that dynamically balances vision- and language-based preferences for more accurate alignment. Extensive evaluations across different benchmarks demonstrate our effectiveness. Notably, our AdaViP-7B achieves 93.7% and 96.4% reductions in response-level and mentioned-level hallucination respectively on the Object HalBench, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, face perception, visual-textual alignment, face segmentation maps, fine-grained facial information

Summary: 
FaceInsight is a novel multimodal large language model designed specifically for face perception tasks. Utilizing visual-textual alignment, it captures both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, addressing the limitations of language-driven reasoning. By incorporating face segmentation maps as an auxiliary modality, FaceInsight enriches visual input with localized structural cues, enhancing semantic understanding of facial features. Extensive experiments across three face perception tasks show that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine other MLLMs in both training-free and fine-tuned settings. This indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing fine-grained facial information and improving accuracy in face-specific queries. The results demonstrate the versatility and capability of FaceInsight in capturing detailed facial information and performing well in various face perception tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding general visual content. However, these general-domain MLLMs perform poorly in face perception tasks, often producing inaccurate or misleading responses to face-specific queries. To address this gap, we propose FaceInsight, the versatile face perception MLLM that provides fine-grained facial information. Our approach introduces visual-textual alignment of facial knowledge to model both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, mitigating the limitations of language-driven reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate face segmentation maps as an auxiliary perceptual modality, enriching the visual input with localized structural cues to enhance semantic understanding. Comprehensive experiments and analyses across three face perception tasks demonstrate that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine compared MLLMs under both training-free and fine-tuned settings.

<div> Keywords: lifelong learning, whole slide images, cancer subtyping, tumor classification, zero-shot classification

Summary:
This study explores the challenge of lifelong learning for whole slide images (WSIs), addressing the need for a unified model to perform multiple tasks. The focus is on continual learning strategies versus vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. WSIs are crucial in clinics and hospitals, requiring efficient training methods due to their size and processing demands. While previous work has utilized regularization and rehearsal methods, this study investigates the effectiveness of vision-language foundation models in achieving zero-shot classification for WSIs. The comparison between conventional continual-learning approaches and zero-shot classification is a novel aspect of this study. The findings aim to inform the development of more efficient and effective models for lifelong WSI learning, with the experimental results and source code of the study soon to be made available for further exploration.

arXiv:2504.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong learning for whole slide images (WSIs) poses the challenge of training a unified model to perform multiple WSI-related tasks, such as cancer subtyping and tumor classification, in a distributed, continual fashion. This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.

Summary: <br />
Improving the generalization ability of affordance grounding models is crucial for real-world applications. The new approach, AffordanceSAM, extends the generalization capacity of the SAM model to affordance recognition for unseen objects and functions. To achieve this, an affordance-adaption module is introduced to modify SAM's segmentation output for affordance grounding regions. A coarse-to-fine training recipe helps SAM recognize affordance objects and actions first, then generate affordance heatmaps accurately. AffordanceSAM's strong generalization capacity surpasses previous methods under the AGD20K benchmark and can handle novel objects and affordance functions effectively. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AffordanceSAM in enhancing the generalization ability of affordance grounding models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of an affordance grounding model to recognize regions for unseen objects and affordance functions is crucial for real-world application. However, current models are still far away from such standards. To address this problem, we introduce AffordanceSAM, an effective approach that extends SAM's generalization capacity to the domain of affordance grounding. For the purpose of thoroughly transferring SAM's robust performance in segmentation to affordance, we initially propose an affordance-adaption module in order to help modify SAM's segmentation output to be adapted to the specific functional regions required for affordance grounding. We concurrently make a coarse-to-fine training recipe to make SAM first be aware of affordance objects and actions coarsely, and then be able to generate affordance heatmaps finely. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show the strong generalization capacity of our AffordanceSAM, which not only surpasses previous methods under AGD20K benchmark but also shows evidence to handle the task with novel objects and affordance functions.

<div> Transformer network, video inpainting, Diffusion Transformer, spatial-temporal consistency, video generation <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Unlike existing algorithms that rely on optical flows, DiTPainter directly uses a transformer network designed for video inpainting. It is trained from scratch, making it more time-efficient than models based on large pretrained networks. DiTPainter is versatile and can handle videos of various lengths, making it suitable for tasks such as video decaptioning and completion. Experimental results demonstrate that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms in terms of quality and spatial-temporal consistency. <div>
arXiv:2504.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing video inpainting algorithms utilize optical flows to construct the corresponding maps and then propagate pixels from adjacent frames to missing areas by mapping. Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.

<div> Keywords: infrared target detection, motion estimation, nonlocal similarity, neural representation, tensor decomposition

Summary:
In the realm of infrared target detection, the challenge lies in detecting dim and small targets amidst dynamic backgrounds. Traditional models struggle with capturing dynamic backgrounds and global spatial-temporal correlations accurately. To remedy this, a new approach is proposed in this paper. By integrating motion estimation and multi-frame fusion, subtle target movements are captured effectively, enhancing motion saliency. Leveraging nonlocal similarity aids in constructing patch tensors with strong low-rank properties. Furthermore, an innovative tensor decomposition-based implicit neural representation (INR) model is introduced to represent the nonlocal patch tensor. This model efficiently encodes nonlocal low-rankness and spatial-temporal correlations of the background through continuous neural representations. The proposed approach, with an alternating direction method of multipliers, showcases superior performance in robustly separating dim targets from complex infrared backgrounds, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared dim and small target detection presents a significant challenge due to dynamic multi-frame scenarios and weak target signatures in the infrared modality. Traditional low-rank plus sparse models often fail to capture dynamic backgrounds and global spatial-temporal correlations, which results in background leakage or target loss. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-enhanced nonlocal similarity implicit neural representation (INR) framework to address these challenges. We first integrate motion estimation via optical flow to capture subtle target movements, and propose multi-frame fusion to enhance motion saliency. Second, we leverage nonlocal similarity to construct patch tensors with strong low-rank properties, and propose an innovative tensor decomposition-based INR model to represent the nonlocal patch tensor, effectively encoding both the nonlocal low-rankness and spatial-temporal correlations of background through continuous neural representations. An alternating direction method of multipliers is developed for the nonlocal INR model, which enjoys theoretical fixed-point convergence. Experimental results show that our approach robustly separates dim targets from complex infrared backgrounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness.

Summary:
FS-DINO is a unified model for few-shot semantic segmentation that combines the knowledge from foundation models DINOv2 and SAM. The model features DINOv2's encoder and a lightweight segmenter with a bottleneck adapter, a meta-visual prompt generator, and a decoder. Through coarse-to-fine cross-model distillation, knowledge from SAM is effectively integrated into the segmenter, further enhanced by 4D correlation mining on support-query pairs. The method is evaluated on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and FSS-1000 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in performance for novel class segmentation with limited annotated images. The approach shows promise in addressing data scarcity challenges and showcases the potential of leveraging multiple foundation models for enhanced representation transferability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has gained increasing interest due to its generalization capability, i.e., segmenting pixels of novel classes requiring only a few annotated images. Prior work has focused on meta-learning for support-query matching, with extensive development in both prototype-based and aggregation-based methods. To address data scarcity, recent approaches have turned to foundation models to enhance representation transferability for novel class segmentation. Among them, a hybrid dual-modal framework including both DINOv2 and SAM has garnered attention due to their complementary capabilities. We wonder "can we build a unified model with knowledge from both foundation models?" To this end, we propose FS-DINO, with only DINOv2's encoder and a lightweight segmenter. The segmenter features a bottleneck adapter, a meta-visual prompt generator based on dense similarities and semantic embeddings, and a decoder. Through coarse-to-fine cross-model distillation, we effectively integrate SAM's knowledge into our lightweight segmenter, which can be further enhanced by 4D correlation mining on support-query pairs. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Summary:
Vidi, a Large Multimodal Model (LMM), is introduced for video editing scenarios, focusing on temporal retrieval to identify time ranges in videos for specific text queries. It can process hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding, outperforming GPT-4o and Gemini. The VUE-TR benchmark offers advancements like longer video durations, audio support, diverse query formats, manual annotation of ground-truth time ranges, and a refined IoU metric for evaluation. Vidi's performance surpasses existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness in video editing tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.

Summary:
The article introduces a new Ultra-Light Real-Time Underwater Object Detection framework called YSOOB, designed to improve accuracy and efficiency in challenging underwater conditions. The framework utilizes a Multi-Spectrum Wavelet Encoder (MSWE) to address issues like low image quality and optical color distortion underwater. By leveraging even-sized and transposed convolutions, YSOOB enhances key information during the resampling process to improve generalization ability. Additionally, the model eliminates redundancy through channel compression and reconstructed large kernel convolution (RLKC) to achieve a lightweight structure with only 1.2 million parameters. Experimental results show that YSOOB achieves competitive performance on URPC2020 and DUO datasets with an mAP50 of 83.1% and 82.9% respectively, while surpassing YOLOv12-N in inference speed on GPU and edge computing devices.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable achievements in object detection, the model's accuracy and efficiency still require further improvement under challenging underwater conditions, such as low image quality and limited computational resources. To address this, we propose an Ultra-Light Real-Time Underwater Object Detection framework, You Sense Only Once Beneath (YSOOB). Specifically, we utilize a Multi-Spectrum Wavelet Encoder (MSWE) to perform frequency-domain encoding on the input image, minimizing the semantic loss caused by underwater optical color distortion. Furthermore, we revisit the unique characteristics of even-sized and transposed convolutions, allowing the model to dynamically select and enhance key information during the resampling process, thereby improving its generalization ability. Finally, we eliminate model redundancy through a simple yet effective channel compression and reconstructed large kernel convolution (RLKC) to achieve model lightweight. As a result, forms a high-performance underwater object detector YSOOB with only 1.2 million parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, with the fewest parameters, YSOOB achieves mAP50 of 83.1% and 82.9% on the URPC2020 and DUO datasets, respectively, comparable to the current SOTA detectors. The inference speed reaches 781.3 FPS and 57.8 FPS on the T4 GPU (TensorRT FP16) and the edge computing device Jetson Xavier NX (TensorRT FP16), surpassing YOLOv12-N by 28.1% and 22.5%, respectively.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive thermal object detection plays a key role in facilitating visible (RGB)-to-thermal (IR) adaptation by reducing the need for co-registered image pairs and minimizing reliance on large annotated IR datasets. However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Summary:<br />
In the field of human-computer interaction, head pose estimation is crucial for various applications. Existing methods based on facial landmarks are precise but computationally complex, limiting their deployment in edge devices and low-power environments. To address this, the Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS) architecture is introduced, leveraging a Deep Set framework with a multihead attention mechanism to group landmarks into regions and reduce computational complexity. The proposed GADS model is significantly smaller and faster than existing models, making it more suitable for resource-constrained environments. By combining landmarks and RGB information, the Hybrid-GADS model offers additional versatility. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GADS in head pose estimation tasks. The proposed architecture serves as a strong baseline for future research in this area.<br />
Summary: <div>

Abstract: In human-computer interaction, head pose estimation profoundly influences application functionality. Although utilizing facial landmarks is valuable for this purpose, existing landmark-based methods prioritize precision over simplicity and model size, limiting their deployment on edge devices and in compute-poor environments. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Grouped Attention Deep Sets (GADS)}, a novel architecture based on the Deep Set framework. By grouping landmarks into regions and employing small Deep Set layers, we reduce computational complexity. Our multihead attention mechanism extracts and combines inter-group information, resulting in a model that is $7.5\times$ smaller and executes $25\times$ faster than the current lightest state-of-the-art model. Notably, our method achieves an impressive reduction, being $4321\times$ smaller than the best-performing model. We introduce vanilla GADS and Hybrid-GADS (landmarks + RGB) and evaluate our models on three benchmark datasets -- AFLW2000, BIWI, and 300W-LP. We envision our architecture as a robust baseline for resource-constrained head pose estimation methods.

Dual-Stream Demoiréing Network (DSDNet) is introduced to address moiré artifacts in smartphone-captured screens. It operates in the raw domain and utilizes a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline along with the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module for moiré removal. Additionally, the Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT) is incorporated to preserve color fidelity by separating luminance and chrominance representations. DSDNet outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation, while also achieving an inference speed 2.4 times faster than the next best method.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile imaging, capturing screens using smartphones has become a prevalent practice in distance learning and conference recording. However, moir\'e artifacts, caused by frequency aliasing between display screens and camera sensors, are further amplified by the image signal processing pipeline, leading to severe visual degradation. Existing sRGB domain demoir\'eing methods struggle with irreversible information loss, while recent two-stage raw domain approaches suffer from information bottlenecks and inference inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage raw domain demoir\'eing framework, Dual-Stream Demoir\'eing Network (DSDNet), which leverages the synergy of raw and YCbCr images to remove moir\'e while preserving luminance and color fidelity. Specifically, to guide luminance correction and moir\'e removal, we design a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline and introduce the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module. This module enriches the raw-to-sRGB conversion with cross-domain contextual features. Furthermore, to better guide color fidelity, we develop a Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT), which decouples luminance and chrominance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation, and achieves an inference speed $\mathrm{\textbf{2.4x}}$ faster than the second-best method, highlighting its practical advantages. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxxxdsdnet.github.io/DSDNet/.

In recent years, various deep learning methods have been explored for edge detection tasks resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to conventional computer vision algorithms. In neural networks, edge detection tasks require considerably large receptive fields to provide satisfactory performance. In a typical convolutional operation, such a large receptive field can be achieved by utilizing a significant number of consecutive layers, which yields deep network structures. Recently, a Multi-scale Tensorial Summation (MTS) factorization operator was presented, which can achieve very large receptive fields even from the initial layers. In this paper, we propose a novel MTS Dimensional Reduction (MTS-DR) module guided neural network, MTS-DR-Net, for the edge detection task. The MTS-DR-Net uses MTS layers, and corresponding MTS-DR blocks as a new backbone to remove redundant information initially. Such a dimensional reduction module enables the neural network to focus specifically on relevant information (i.e., necessary subspaces). Finally, a weight U-shaped refinement module follows MTS-DR blocks in the MTS-DR-Net. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark edge detection datasets: BSDS500 and BIPEDv2 to verify the effectiveness of our model. The implementation of the proposed MTS-DR-Net can be found at https://github.com/LeiXuAI/MTS-DR-Net.git.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on accurate perception and localization of the ego car to ensure safety and reliability in challenging real-world driving scenarios. Public datasets play a vital role in benchmarking and guiding advancement in research by providing standardized resources for model development and evaluation. However, potential inaccuracies in sensor calibration and vehicle poses within these datasets can lead to erroneous evaluations of downstream tasks, adversely impacting the reliability and performance of the autonomous systems. To address this challenge, we propose a robust optimization method based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to refine sensor poses and calibration parameters, enhancing the integrity of dataset benchmarks. To validate improvement in accuracy of our optimized poses without ground truth, we present a thorough evaluation process, relying on reprojection metrics, Novel View Synthesis rendering quality, and geometric alignment. We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in sensor pose accuracy. By optimizing these critical parameters, our approach not only improves the utility of existing datasets but also paves the way for more reliable autonomous driving models. To foster continued progress in this field, we make the optimized sensor poses publicly available, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

<div> CTA images, age prediction, heart morphology, machine learning, saliency analysis <br />
Summary: <br />
Age prediction from CTA images is studied to understand the relationship between heart morphology and aging. A novel biomarker called morphological heart age is developed using image registration and unsupervised segmentation techniques to extract features. Machine learning models achieve a mean absolute error of 2.74 years for females and 2.77 years for males in predicting chronological age. Sub-region predictions are consistent with whole heart predictions, indicating the importance of morphology. Saliency analysis identifies regions positively and negatively associated with predicted age, aiding interpretability of the models. This research provides insights into the information carried by heart morphology about chronological age, offering potential applications in data-driven aging research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Age prediction from medical images or other health-related non-imaging data is an important approach to data-driven aging research, providing knowledge of how much information a specific tissue or organ carries about the chronological age of the individual. In this work, we studied the prediction of age from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which provide detailed representations of the heart morphology, with the goals of (i) studying the relationship between morphology and aging, and (ii) developing a novel \emph{morphological heart age} biomarker. We applied an image registration-based method that standardizes the images from the whole cohort into a single space. We then extracted supervoxels (using unsupervised segmentation), and corresponding robust features of density and local volume, which provide a detailed representation of the heart morphology while being robust to registration errors. Machine learning models are then trained to fit regression models from these features to the chronological age. We applied the method to a subset of the images from the Swedish CArdioPulomonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) dataset, consisting of 721 females and 666 males. We observe a mean absolute error of $2.74$ years for females and $2.77$ years for males. The predictions from different sub-regions of interest were observed to be more highly correlated with the predictions from the whole heart, compared to the chronological age, revealing a high consistency in the predictions from morphology. Saliency analysis was also performed on the prediction models to study what regions are associated positively and negatively with the predicted age. This resulted in detailed association maps where the density and volume of known, as well as some novel sub-regions of interest, are determined to be important. The saliency analysis aids in the interpretability of the models and their predictions.

Summary: 
A new approach to generating ground-view images from satellite imagery has been proposed, addressing challenges such as resolution and viewing angle discrepancies. The method focuses on ensuring consistency across generated ground views by using a fixed latent diffusion model and two conditioning modules: satellite-guided denoising and satellite-temporal denoising. A large-scale dataset with over 100,000 perspective pairs has been created to support ground scene and video generation. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms existing methods in terms of photorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs. <div>

Abstract: Generating consistent ground-view images from satellite imagery is challenging, primarily due to the large discrepancies in viewing angles and resolution between satellite and ground-level domains. Previous efforts mainly concentrated on single-view generation, often resulting in inconsistencies across neighboring ground views. In this work, we propose a novel cross-view synthesis approach designed to overcome these challenges by ensuring consistency across ground-view images generated from satellite views. Our method, based on a fixed latent diffusion model, introduces two conditioning modules: satellite-guided denoising, which extracts high-level scene layout to guide the denoising process, and satellite-temporal denoising, which captures camera motion to maintain consistency across multiple generated views. We further contribute a large-scale satellite-ground dataset containing over 100,000 perspective pairs to facilitate extensive ground scene or video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on perceptual and temporal metrics, achieving high photorealism and consistency in multi-view outputs.

Summary:
- Algorithms utilizing artificial neural networks for lip reading have shown significant improvement in word recognition, particularly in the English language.
- A study focused on developing a neural network for lip reading in the German language, utilizing 1806 video clips of German speakers split into word segments.
- The study compared the 3D Convolutional Neural Network, Gated Recurrent Units models, and a combination of both (GRUConv) for their accuracy in lip reading.
- A higher accuracy of 70% was achieved when focusing on the lips in video segments, compared to 34% when focusing on the entire speaker's face.
- The GRUConv model demonstrated maximum accuracies of 87% with known speakers and 63% in validation with unknown speakers, showcasing high accuracy levels in lip reading for the German language. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When reading lips, many people benefit from additional visual information from the lip movements of the speaker, which is, however, very error prone. Algorithms for lip reading with artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks significantly improve word recognition but are not available for the German language. A total of 1806 video clips with only one German-speaking person each were selected, split into word segments, and assigned to word classes using speech-recognition software. In 38,391 video segments with 32 speakers, 18 polysyllabic, visually distinguishable words were used to train and validate a neural network. The 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Units models and a combination of both models (GRUConv) were compared, as were different image sections and color spaces of the videos. The accuracy was determined in 5000 training epochs. Comparison of the color spaces did not reveal any relevant different correct classification rates in the range from 69% to 72%. With a cut to the lips, a significantly higher accuracy of 70% was achieved than when cut to the entire speaker's face (34%). With the GRUConv model, the maximum accuracies were 87% with known speakers and 63% in the validation with unknown speakers. The neural network for lip reading, which was first developed for the German language, shows a very high level of accuracy, comparable to English-language algorithms. It works with unknown speakers as well and can be generalized with more word classes.

Summary:<br /> 
This article introduces a novel approach, SM-DSB, to improve object classification models using point cloud data in unseen or out-of-distribution scenarios. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods for point clouds struggle with conflicting gradients from self-supervision tasks. SM-DSB utilizes a scoring mechanism based on 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts and filters out samples with detrimental gradients. This solution is scalable and can be integrated into existing multi-task learning frameworks for point cloud UDA. Experimental results show that SM-DSB outperforms current methods. Additionally, the approach provides insights into the UDA problem through back-propagation analysis. <div>
arXiv:2504.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object classification models utilizing point cloud data are fundamental for 3D media understanding, yet they often struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Existing point cloud unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods typically employ a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that combines primary classification tasks with auxiliary self-supervision tasks to bridge the gap between cross-domain feature distributions. However, our further experiments demonstrate that not all gradients from self-supervision tasks are beneficial and some may negatively impact the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, termed Saliency Map-based Data Sampling Block (SM-DSB), to mitigate these gradient conflicts. Specifically, our method designs a new scoring mechanism based on the skewness of 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts without requiring target labels. Leveraging this, we develop a sample selection strategy that dynamically filters out samples whose self-supervision gradients are not beneficial for the classification. Our approach is scalable, introducing modest computational overhead, and can be integrated into all the point cloud UDA MTL frameworks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we provide a new perspective on understanding the UDA problem through back-propagation analysis.

This study presents a novel adversarial patch designed to attack Near-Infrared (NIR) face recognition systems in a black-box setting. The patch utilizes human-imperceptible infrared-absorbing ink and is digitally optimized for infrared images. A light reflection model for human skin is developed to minimize discrepancies between digital and real-world NIR imaging.

Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) face recognition systems, which can operate effectively in low-light conditions or in the presence of makeup, exhibit vulnerabilities when subjected to physical adversarial attacks. To further demonstrate the potential risks in real-world applications, we design a novel, stealthy, and practical adversarial patch to attack NIR face recognition systems in a black-box setting. We achieved this by utilizing human-imperceptible infrared-absorbing ink to generate multiple patches with digitally optimized shapes and positions for infrared images. To address the optimization mismatch between digital and real-world NIR imaging, we develop a light reflection model for human skin to minimize pixel-level discrepancies by simulating NIR light reflection.
  Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) physical attacks on NIR face recognition systems, the experimental results show that our method improves the attack success rate in both digital and physical domains, particularly maintaining effectiveness across various face postures. Notably, the proposed approach outperforms SOTA methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 82.46% in the physical domain across different models, compared to 64.18% for existing methods.

Summary:In this article, a novel framework called AnimPortrait3D is proposed for generating high-quality and animatable 3D head avatars from text input. The current methods face challenges in synthesizing realistic details and aligning the appearance with the driving parametric model. The proposed framework addresses these issues by utilizing prior information from a pretrained text-to-3D model to initialize the avatar with robust appearance, geometry, and rigging relationships. Additionally, a ControlNet is introduced to refine the initial avatar for dynamic expressions, ensuring accurate alignment with the morphable model using semantic and normal maps. The method outperforms existing approaches in terms of synthesis quality, alignment, and animation fidelity, advancing the state of the art in text-based, animatable 3D head avatar generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality, animatable 3D head avatars from text has enormous potential in content creation applications such as games, movies, and embodied virtual assistants. Current text-to-3D generation methods typically combine parametric head models with 2D diffusion models using score distillation sampling to produce 3D-consistent results. However, they struggle to synthesize realistic details and suffer from misalignments between the appearance and the driving parametric model, resulting in unnatural animation results. We discovered that these limitations stem from ambiguities in the 2D diffusion predictions during 3D avatar distillation, specifically: i) the avatar's appearance and geometry is underconstrained by the text input, and ii) the semantic alignment between the predictions and the parametric head model is insufficient because the diffusion model alone cannot incorporate information from the parametric model. In this work, we propose a novel framework, AnimPortrait3D, for text-based realistic animatable 3DGS avatar generation with morphable model alignment, and introduce two key strategies to address these challenges. First, we tackle appearance and geometry ambiguities by utilizing prior information from a pretrained text-to-3D model to initialize a 3D avatar with robust appearance, geometry, and rigging relationships to the morphable model. Second, we refine the initial 3D avatar for dynamic expressions using a ControlNet that is conditioned on semantic and normal maps of the morphable model to ensure accurate alignment. As a result, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of synthesis quality, alignment, and animation fidelity. Our experiments show that the proposed method advances the state of the art in text-based, animatable 3D head avatar generation.

<div> Keywords: event cameras, depth estimation, SLAM, neural network, deep learning

Summary: 
Event cameras, known for their ability to capture blur-free 3D edges at high speed, present a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Traditional deep learning frameworks struggle with the asynchronous nature of event data, leading to the proposal of a new framework for pixel-wise depth estimation using event cameras in monocular and stereo setups. By encoding 3D scene structure into Disparity Space Images (DSIs) and utilizing a neural network with 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure, the framework processes local subregions of the DSIs for depth prediction. Results on standard benchmarks show that the method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods with purely monocular data, outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with stereo data, and increases depth completeness while reducing errors significantly. The framework's fast inference, low model complexity, and effectiveness with event data suggest its potential to become a standard approach for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Summary: 
MedNNS introduces a Neural Network Search framework for medical imaging tasks. It addresses challenges in architecture selection and weight initialization by creating a meta-space that considers dataset and model performance together. Using a Supernetwork-based approach, the model zoo size is expanded significantly. Rank loss and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) loss are incorporated to improve alignment in the meta-space. Experimental results show that MedNNS outperforms ImageNet pre-trained models and other state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1.7% across datasets and faster convergence.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable progress in the field of medical imaging. However, adapting DL models to medical tasks remains a significant challenge, primarily due to two key factors: (1) architecture selection, as different tasks necessitate specialized model designs, and (2) weight initialization, which directly impacts the convergence speed and final performance of the models. Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely adopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial differences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network Search framework for medical imaging applications. MedNNS jointly optimizes architecture selection and weight initialization by constructing a meta-space that encodes datasets and models based on how well they perform together. We build this space using a Supernetwork-based approach, expanding the model zoo size by 51x times over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, we introduce rank loss and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) loss into the construction of the space to capture inter-model and inter-dataset relationships, thereby achieving more accurate alignment in the meta-space. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that MedNNS significantly outperforms both ImageNet pre-trained DL models and SOTA Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1.7% across datasets while converging substantially faster. The code and the processed meta-space is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MedNNS.

Summary: <br /><br />Diabetic retinopathy is a serious ocular complication that can lead to vision loss. Early detection and accurate grading are crucial for effective treatment. Current automatic grading methods utilize deep learning on retinal fundus images, but the complex patterns of lesions make it challenging to detect subtle changes. The RadFuse framework integrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus images to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection. By combining spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse improves the differentiation of severity levels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements over fundus-image-only models across different convolutional neural networks. RadFuse achieved high accuracy in severity grading and binary classification tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. This study highlights the importance of advanced mathematical transforms in medical image analysis for improving diabetic retinopathy classification. <div>

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a serious ocular complication that poses a significant threat to patients' vision and overall health. Early detection and accurate grading are essential to prevent vision loss. Current automatic grading methods rely heavily on deep learning applied to retinal fundus images, but the complex, irregular patterns of lesions in these images, which vary in shape and distribution, make it difficult to capture subtle changes. This study introduces RadFuse, a multi-representation deep learning framework that integrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus images to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. Our RadEx transformation, an optimized non-linear extension of the Radon transform, generates sinogram representations to capture complex retinal lesion patterns. By leveraging both spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse enriches the feature set available to deep learning models, improving the differentiation of severity levels. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, APTOS-2019 and DDR, using three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNeXt-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. RadFuse showed significant improvements over fundus-image-only models across all three CNN architectures and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. For severity grading across five stages, RadFuse achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.24%, an accuracy of 87.07%, and an F1-score of 87.17%. In binary classification between healthy and diabetic retinopathy cases, the method reached an accuracy of 99.09%, precision of 98.58%, and recall of 99.6%, surpassing previously established models. These results demonstrate RadFuse's capacity to capture complex non-linear features, advancing diabetic retinopathy classification and promoting the integration of advanced mathematical transforms in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate 3D semantic occupancy perception is essential for autonomous driving in complex environments with diverse and irregular objects. While vision-centric methods suffer from geometric inaccuracies, LiDAR-based approaches often lack rich semantic information. To address these limitations, MS-Occ, a novel multi-stage LiDAR-camera fusion framework which includes middle-stage fusion and late-stage fusion, is proposed, integrating LiDAR's geometric fidelity with camera-based semantic richness via hierarchical cross-modal fusion. The framework introduces innovations at two critical stages: (1) In the middle-stage feature fusion, the Gaussian-Geo module leverages Gaussian kernel rendering on sparse LiDAR depth maps to enhance 2D image features with dense geometric priors, and the Semantic-Aware module enriches LiDAR voxels with semantic context via deformable cross-attention; (2) In the late-stage voxel fusion, the Adaptive Fusion (AF) module dynamically balances voxel features across modalities, while the High Classification Confidence Voxel Fusion (HCCVF) module resolves semantic inconsistencies using self-attention-based refinement. Experiments on the nuScenes-OpenOccupancy benchmark show that MS-Occ achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 32.1% and a mean IoU (mIoU) of 25.3%, surpassing the state-of-the-art by +0.7% IoU and +2.4% mIoU. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each module, with substantial improvements in small-object perception, demonstrating the practical value of MS-Occ for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios.

<div> Keywords: visual answer localization, In-VAL task, Ask2Loc, interactive video understanding, semantic gap issues 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new task called In-VAL, which simulates the interactive process between humans and videos to locate specific segments within instructional videos. The In-VAL task addresses issues such as user intent ambiguity, language incompleteness in video subtitles, and fragmented content in video segments. The proposed Ask2Loc framework consists of three key modules: a chatting module to refine initial questions, a rewriting module to generate fluent language, and a searching module to provide integrated content. Extensive experiments on In-VAL datasets show that Ask2Loc outperforms traditional methods, improving performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU). The code and datasets for Ask2Loc are available on GitHub at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc.

Abstract: Locating specific segments within an instructional video is an efficient way to acquire guiding knowledge. Generally, the task of obtaining video segments for both verbal explanations and visual demonstrations is known as visual answer localization (VAL). However, users often need multiple interactions to obtain answers that align with their expectations when using the system. During these interactions, humans deepen their understanding of the video content by asking themselves questions, thereby accurately identifying the location. Therefore, we propose a new task, named In-VAL, to simulate the multiple interactions between humans and videos in the procedure of obtaining visual answers. The In-VAL task requires interactively addressing several semantic gap issues, including 1) the ambiguity of user intent in the input questions, 2) the incompleteness of language in video subtitles, and 3) the fragmentation of content in video segments. To address these issues, we propose Ask2Loc, a framework for resolving In-VAL by asking questions. It includes three key modules: 1) a chatting module to refine initial questions and uncover clear intentions, 2) a rewriting module to generate fluent language and create complete descriptions, and 3) a searching module to broaden local context and provide integrated content. We conduct extensive experiments on three reconstructed In-VAL datasets. Compared to traditional end-to-end and two-stage methods, our proposed Ask2Loc can improve performance by up to 14.91 (mIoU) on the In-VAL task. Our code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/changzong/Ask2Loc.

<div> Unsupervised Video Summarisation, Meta Prompting, LLMs, Long-form video understanding, Pseudo-summaries

Summary:<br />
The system ViSMap introduces a method for summarizing long videos without supervision. It addresses the challenge of summarizing long, unsegmented videos where relevant events are sparse. By using Language Models (LLMs) to create pseudo-summaries based on short video segment descriptions, ViSMap eliminates the need for costly annotations of long videos. The approach involves a meta-prompting strategy that iteratively generates and refines pseudo-summaries using three LLMs in sequence. The quality of the summaries is dependent on the prompt of the generator, which is optimized through iterations. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows that ViSMaP performs comparably to fully supervised models while maintaining generalization across domains. The code for ViSMaP will be available upon publication.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision. Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones. These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos. Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos. We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance. Code will be released upon publication.

Summary:<br /><br />MedTrim is a novel method proposed for enhancing image-text alignment in medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) for chest X-ray evaluations. It focuses on preserving subtle pathology attributes like location, size, and severity by leveraging structured meta-entity information extracted from CXR reports. MedTrim utilizes a score function for refined sample selection in triplet mining, capturing inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. It introduces a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit alignment within and across modalities, improving performance in retrieval and classification tasks compared to existing methods. Through ontology-based entity recognition, MedTrim enhances image-text alignment by considering fine-grained pathology characteristics, offering a more comprehensive interpretation of diagnostic imaging data. <div>
arXiv:2504.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods.

Summary: 
Accurate brain morphometry from structural MRI is essential for studying neuroanatomical changes, but variability and reproducibility challenges persist. This study benchmarks FastSurfer and SynthSeg, integrated into FreeSurfer, on two datasets to evaluate segmentation variability. Results show volume variations in small brain structures, raising concerns about detecting subtle longitudinal changes. The study analyzes registration templates and interpolation modes, suggesting surface-based quality filtering to enhance segmentation reliability. The research emphasizes the need for harmonization strategies in neuroimaging studies to address domain-induced morphometric noise effectively.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reproducible brain morphometry from structural MRI is critical for monitoring neuroanatomical changes across time and across imaging domains. Although deep learning has accelerated segmentation workflows, scanner-induced variability and reproducibility limitations remain-especially in longitudinal and multi-site settings. In this study, we benchmark two modern segmentation pipelines, FastSurfer and SynthSeg, both integrated into FreeSurfer, one of the most widely adopted tools in neuroimaging.
  Using two complementary datasets - a 17-year longitudinal cohort (SIMON) and a 9-site test-retest cohort (SRPBS)-we quantify inter-scan segmentation variability using Dice coefficient, Surface Dice, Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our results reveal up to 7-8% volume variation in small subcortical structures such as the amygdala and ventral diencephalon, even under controlled test-retest conditions. This raises a key question: is it feasible to detect subtle longitudinal changes on the order of 5-10% in pea-sized brain regions, given the magnitude of domain-induced morphometric noise?
  We further analyze the effects of registration templates and interpolation modes, and propose surface-based quality filtering to improve segmentation reliability. This study provides a reproducible benchmark for morphometric reproducibility and emphasizes the need for harmonization strategies in real-world neuroimaging studies.

<div> Keywords: video generation, physical laws, symbolic reasoning, reinforcement learning, Phys-AR framework

Summary: 
The paper presents a novel approach, Phys-AR, for generating videos that adhere to physical laws by integrating symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning. The Diffusion Timestep Tokenizer (DDT) is introduced to learn visual tokens and enable symbolic reasoning. The Phys-AR framework consists of two stages: supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge and reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning abilities based on physical conditions. This approach allows for dynamically adjusting and improving the physical properties of generated videos. Experimental results demonstrate that Phys-AR can generate videos that are physically consistent. Overall, the integration of symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning provides a promising solution for producing videos that accurately reflect physical laws. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, producing videos that adhere to physical laws remains a significant challenge. Traditional diffusion-based methods struggle to extrapolate to unseen physical conditions (eg, velocity) due to their reliance on data-driven approximations. To address this, we propose to integrate symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to enforce physical consistency in video generation. We first introduce the Diffusion Timestep Tokenizer (DDT), which learns discrete, recursive visual tokens by recovering visual attributes lost during the diffusion process. The recursive visual tokens enable symbolic reasoning by a large language model. Based on it, we propose the Phys-AR framework, which consists of two stages: The first stage uses supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge, while the second stage applies reinforcement learning to optimize the model's reasoning abilities through reward functions based on physical conditions. Our approach allows the model to dynamically adjust and improve the physical properties of generated videos, ensuring adherence to physical laws. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysAR can generate videos that are physically consistent.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel scenes that faithfully preserve subject identity from reference images while adhering to textual guidance, yet existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor employs semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated image. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve geometry priors of reference subjects for robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nihukat/FreeGraftor.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Deep Learning techniques has shown remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, paving the way for their deployment in extraterrestrial exploration. Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for addressing the scarcity of labeled data in these novel environments. This paper represents one of the first efforts in evaluating the feasibility of employing adapters toward efficient transfer learning for rock segmentation in extraterrestrial landscapes, mainly focusing on lunar and martian terrains. Our work suggests that the use of adapters, strategically integrated into a pre-trained backbone model, can be successful in reducing both bandwidth and memory requirements for the target extraterrestrial device. In this study, we considered two memory-saving strategies: layer fusion (to reduce to zero the inference overhead) and an ``adapter ranking'' (to also reduce the transmission cost). Finally, we evaluate these results in terms of task performance, memory, and computation on embedded devices, evidencing trade-offs that open the road to more research in the field.

Abstract: The rapid growth of long-duration, high-definition videos has made efficient video quality assessment (VQA) a critical challenge. Existing research typically tackles this problem through two main strategies: reducing model parameters and resampling inputs. However, light-weight Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often struggle to balance efficiency with high performance due to the requirement of long-range modeling capabilities. Recently, the state-space model, particularly Mamba, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Meanwhile, efficient VQA heavily depends on resampling long sequences to minimize computational costs, yet current resampling methods are often weak in preserving essential semantic information. In this work, we present MVQA, a Mamba-based model designed for efficient VQA along with a novel Unified Semantic and Distortion Sampling (USDS) approach. USDS combines semantic patch sampling from low-resolution videos and distortion patch sampling from original-resolution videos. The former captures semantically dense regions, while the latter retains critical distortion details. To prevent computation increase from dual inputs, we propose a fusion mechanism using pre-defined masks, enabling a unified sampling strategy that captures both semantic and quality information without additional computational burden. Experiments show that the proposed MVQA, equipped with USDS, achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while being $2\times$ as fast and requiring only $1/5$ GPU memory.

Abstract: Adapter-based methods are commonly used to enhance model performance with minimal additional complexity, especially in video editing tasks that require frame-to-frame consistency. By inserting small, learnable modules into pretrained diffusion models, these adapters can maintain temporal coherence without extensive retraining. Approaches that incorporate prompt learning with both shared and frame-specific tokens are particularly effective in preserving continuity across frames at low training cost. In this work, we want to provide a general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in DDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the temporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms, and we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that gradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and converges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate range. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion procedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled. These theoretical findings will reinforce the reliability of diffusion-based video editing methods that rely on adapter strategies and provide theoretical insights in video generation tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud has demonstrated effectiveness in improving pre-trained model performance across diverse tasks. However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human annotations or proprietary model APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data, which limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production pipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR), resulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset for high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT, the ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general video QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K benchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art results at the 7B/8B scale on popular video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME and OVOBench, demonstrating the broad generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Foundation models, trained on vast amounts of data using self-supervised techniques, have emerged as a promising frontier for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medicine. This study evaluates three different vision-language foundation models (RAD-DINO, CheXagent, and BiomedCLIP) on their ability to capture fine-grained imaging features for radiology tasks. The models were assessed across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks for pneumothorax and cardiomegaly on chest radiographs. Self-supervised RAD-DINO consistently excelled in segmentation tasks, while text-supervised CheXagent demonstrated superior classification performance. BiomedCLIP showed inconsistent performance across tasks. A custom segmentation model that integrates global and local features substantially improved performance for all foundation models, particularly for challenging pneumothorax segmentation. The findings highlight that pre-training methodology significantly influences model performance on specific downstream tasks. For fine-grained segmentation tasks, models trained without text supervision performed better, while text-supervised models offered advantages in classification and interpretability. These insights provide guidance for selecting foundation models based on specific clinical applications in radiology.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are designed to extract relevant visuospatial information from images. Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike scene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their ability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability, VLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide variety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures are at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one object is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark dataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a table, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that performance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically equivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may reason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal novel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient training and testing.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

Abstract: Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for specific regions in images and videos remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. We introduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed localized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context through two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution encoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates precise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and expands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new state-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and detailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning.

<title>From Reflection to Perfection: Scaling Inference-Time Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Reflection Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive visual quality through extensive scaling of training data and model parameters, yet they often struggle with complex scenes and fine-grained details. Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, offering superior temporal consistency and visual quality compared to traditional generative adversarial networks-based approaches. While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field. A structured list of related works involved in this survey is also available on https://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Survey-Video-Diffusion.

<title>MR. Video: "MapReduce" is the Principle for Long Video Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16082</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MR. Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips. Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length. Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments. Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval. This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness.
  In practice, MR. Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce). MR. Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.

<title>MMInference: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context VLMs via Modality-Aware Permutation Sparse Attention</title>

arXiv:2504.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of long-context capabilities with visual understanding unlocks unprecedented potential for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the quadratic attention complexity during the pre-filling phase remains a significant obstacle to real-world deployment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial locality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern. Simultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across different modalities. We introduce a permutation-based method to leverage the unique Grid pattern and handle modality boundary issues. By offline search the optimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse distribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates seamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or fine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA, Captioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art long-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Recent prompt-based image editing models have demonstrated impressive prompt-following capability at structural editing tasks. However, existing models still fail to perform local edits, follow detailed editing prompts, or maintain global image quality beyond a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and improves image quality consistently during more than 100 editing steps. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. SPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic image-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal, replacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and structural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the highest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but it is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.

Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial surveillance platform, Veg, designed as a fault-tolerant quadcopter system that integrates visual SLAM for GPS-independent navigation, advanced control architecture for dynamic stability, and embedded vision modules for real-time object and face recognition. The platform features a cascaded control design with an LQR inner-loop and PD outer-loop trajectory control. It leverages ORB-SLAM3 for 6-DoF localization and loop closure, and supports waypoint-based navigation through Dijkstra path planning over SLAM-derived maps. A real-time Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system detects rotor faults and executes emergency landing through re-routing. The embedded vision system, based on a lightweight CNN and PCA, enables onboard object detection and face recognition with high precision. The drone operates fully onboard using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Nano, validated through simulations and real-world testing. This work consolidates real-time localization, fault recovery, and embedded AI on a single platform suitable for constrained environments.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, underscoring the importance of early detection for effective treatment. However, automated DR classification remains challenging due to variations in image quality, class imbalance, and pixel-level similarities that hinder model training. To address these issues, we propose a robust preprocessing pipeline incorporating image cropping, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and targeted data augmentation to improve model generalization and resilience. Our approach leverages the Swin Transformer, which utilizes hierarchical token processing and shifted window attention to efficiently capture fine-grained features while maintaining linear computational complexity. We validate our method on the Aptos and IDRiD datasets for multi-class DR classification, achieving accuracy rates of 89.65% and 97.40%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in detecting early-stage DR, highlighting its potential for improving automated retinal screening in clinical settings.

<title>HyperFlow: Gradient-Free Emulation of Few-Shot Fine-Tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While test-time fine-tuning is beneficial in few-shot learning, the need for multiple backpropagation steps can be prohibitively expensive in real-time or low-resource scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that emulates gradient descent without computing gradients, enabling efficient test-time adaptation. Specifically, we formulate gradient descent as an Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and train an auxiliary network to predict the task-conditional drift using only the few-shot support set. The adaptation then reduces to a simple numerical integration (e.g., via the Euler method), which requires only a few forward passes of the auxiliary network -- no gradients or forward passes of the target model are needed. In experiments on cross-domain few-shot classification using the Meta-Dataset and CDFSL benchmarks, our method significantly improves out-of-domain performance over the non-fine-tuned baseline while incurring only 6\% of the memory cost and 0.02\% of the computation time of standard fine-tuning, thus establishing a practical middle ground between direct transfer and fully fine-tuned approaches.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation has gained more attention over the years for robotics-assisted tasks that require precise interaction with physical objects. This paper presents an interactive 3D-to-2D visualization and annotation tool to support the 6D pose estimation research community. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed work is the first tool that allows users to visualize and manipulate 3D objects interactively on a 2D real-world scene, along with a comprehensive user study. This system supports robust 6D camera pose annotation by providing both visual cues and spatial relationships to determine object position and orientation in various environments. The annotation feature in Vision6D is particularly helpful in scenarios where the transformation matrix between the camera and world objects is unknown, as it enables accurate annotation of these objects' poses using only the camera intrinsic matrix. This capability serves as a foundational step in developing and training advanced pose estimation models across various domains. We evaluate Vision6D's effectiveness by utilizing widely-used open-source pose estimation datasets Linemod and HANDAL through comparisons between the default ground-truth camera poses with manual annotations. A user study was performed to show that Vision6D generates accurate pose annotations via visual cues in an intuitive 3D user interface. This approach aims to bridge the gap between 2D scene projections and 3D scenes, offering an effective way for researchers and developers to solve 6D pose annotation related problems. The software is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/InteractiveGL/vision6D.

Abstract: This paper investigates multimodal agents, in particular, OpenAI's Computer-User Agent (CUA), trained to control and complete tasks through a standard computer interface, similar to humans. We evaluated the agent's performance on the New York Times Wordle game to elicit model behaviors and identify shortcomings. Our findings revealed a significant discrepancy in the model's ability to recognize colors correctly depending on the context. The model had a $5.36\%$ success rate over several hundred runs across a week of Wordle. Despite the immense enthusiasm surrounding AI agents and their potential to usher in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our findings reinforce the fact that even simple tasks present substantial challenges for today's frontier AI models. We conclude with a discussion of the potential underlying causes, implications for future development, and research directions to improve these AI systems.

<title>Unifying Image Counterfactuals and Feature Attributions with Latent-Space Adversarial Attacks</title>

arXiv:2504.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactuals are a popular framework for interpreting machine learning predictions. These what if explanations are notoriously challenging to create for computer vision models: standard gradient-based methods are prone to produce adversarial examples, in which imperceptible modifications to image pixels provoke large changes in predictions. We introduce a new, easy-to-implement framework for counterfactual images that can flexibly adapt to contemporary advances in generative modeling. Our method, Counterfactual Attacks, resembles an adversarial attack on the representation of the image along a low-dimensional manifold. In addition, given an auxiliary dataset of image descriptors, we show how to accompany counterfactuals with feature attribution that quantify the changes between the original and counterfactual images. These importance scores can be aggregated into global counterfactual explanations that highlight the overall features driving model predictions. While this unification is possible for any counterfactual method, it has particular computational efficiency for ours. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with the MNIST and CelebA datasets.

Abstract: We propose a perceptual chromatic adaptation transform for white balance that makes use of split-quaternions. The novelty of the present work, which is motivated by a recently developed quantum-like model of color perception, consists at stressing the link between the algebraic structures appearing in this model and a certain sub-algebra of the split-quaternions. We show the potentiality of this approach for color image processing applications by proposing a chromatic adaptation transform, implemented via an appropriate use of the split-quaternion multiplication. Moreover, quantitative comparisons with the widely used state-of-the art von Kries chromatic adaptation transform are provided.

Abstract: Standardized performance evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems remains a critical unmet need in the field of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). While the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG311 report and recent FDA draft guidance provide recommended metrics for system characterization, practical tools for extracting these metrics remain limited, inconsistent, and often inaccessible. We present QUEL-QAL, an open-source Python library designed to streamline and standardize the quantitative analysis of fluorescence images using solid reference targets. The library provides a modular, reproducible workflow that includes region of interest (ROI) detection, statistical analysis, and visualization capabilities. QUEL-QAL supports key metrics such as response linearity, limit of detection, depth sensitivity, and spatial resolution, in alignment with regulatory and academic guidance. Built on widely adopted Python packages, the library is designed to be extensible, enabling users to adapt it to novel target designs and analysis protocols. By promoting transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory alignment, QUEL-QAL offers a foundational tool to support standardized benchmarking and accelerate the development and evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems.

<title>VLM-based Prompts as the Optimal Assistant for Unpaired Histopathology Virtual Staining</title>

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue sections are typically stained using common H&amp;E staining or special stains (MAS, PAS, PASM, etc.) to clearly visualize specific tissue structures. The rapid advancement of deep learning offers an effective solution for generating virtually stained images, significantly reducing the time and labor costs associated with traditional histochemical staining. However, a new challenge arises in separating the fundamental visual characteristics of tissue sections from the visual differences induced by staining agents. Additionally, virtual staining often overlooks essential pathological knowledge and the physical properties of staining, resulting in only style-level transfer. To address these issues, we introduce, for the first time in virtual staining tasks, a pathological vision-language large model (VLM) as an auxiliary tool. We integrate contrastive learnable prompts, foundational concept anchors for tissue sections, and staining-specific concept anchors to leverage the extensive knowledge of the pathological VLM. This approach is designed to describe, frame, and enhance the direction of virtual staining. Furthermore, we have developed a data augmentation method based on the constraints of the VLM. This method utilizes the VLM's powerful image interpretation capabilities to further integrate image style and structural information, proving beneficial in high-precision pathological diagnostics. Extensive evaluations on publicly available multi-domain unpaired staining datasets demonstrate that our method can generate highly realistic images and enhance the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as glomerular detection and segmentation.

Abstract: In medical imaging, anomaly detection is a vital element of healthcare diagnostics, especially for neurological conditions which can be life-threatening. Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions.

Abstract: In deep learning-based classification tasks, the softmax function's temperature parameter $T$ critically influences the output distribution and overall performance. This study presents a novel theoretical insight that the optimal temperature $T^*$ is uniquely determined by the dimensionality of the feature representations, thereby enabling training-free determination of $T^*$. Despite this theoretical grounding, empirical evidence reveals that $T^*$ fluctuates under practical conditions owing to variations in models, datasets, and other confounding factors. To address these influences, we propose and optimize a set of temperature determination coefficients that specify how $T^*$ should be adjusted based on the theoretical relationship to feature dimensionality. Additionally, we insert a batch normalization layer immediately before the output layer, effectively stabilizing the feature space. Building on these coefficients and a suite of large-scale experiments, we develop an empirical formula to estimate $T^*$ without additional training while also introducing a corrective scheme to refine $T^*$ based on the number of classes and task complexity. Our findings confirm that the derived temperature not only aligns with the proposed theoretical perspective but also generalizes effectively across diverse tasks, consistently enhancing classification performance and offering a practical, training-free solution for determining $T^*$.

Abstract: The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.

Abstract: As a fundamental challenge in visual computing, video super-resolution (VSR) focuses on reconstructing highdefinition video sequences from their degraded lowresolution counterparts. While deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spatial-temporal super-resolution tasks, their computationally intensive nature poses significant deployment challenges for resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in real-time mobile video processing scenarios where power efficiency and latency constraints coexist. In this work, we propose a Reparameterizable Architecture for High Fidelity Video Super Resolution method, named RepNet-VSR, for real-time 4x video super-resolution. On the REDS validation set, the proposed model achieves 27.79 dB PSNR when processing 180p to 720p frames in 103 ms per 10 frames on a MediaTek Dimensity NPU. The competition results demonstrate an excellent balance between restoration quality and deployment efficiency. The proposed method scores higher than the previous champion algorithm of MAI video super-resolution challenge.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel AI vision-enabled pediatric prosthetic hand designed to assist children aged 10-12 with upper limb disabilities. The prosthesis features an anthropomorphic appearance, multi-articulating functionality, and a lightweight design that mimics a natural hand, making it both accessible and affordable for low-income families. Using 3D printing technology and integrating advanced machine vision, sensing, and embedded computing, the prosthetic hand offers a low-cost, customizable solution that addresses the limitations of current myoelectric prostheses. A micro camera is interfaced with a low-power FPGA for real-time object detection and assists with precise grasping. The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp classification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the force prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features of the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted micro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks; b) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and c) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained power and resource limits.

Abstract: Machine learning models tend to learn spurious features - features that strongly correlate with target labels but are not causal. Existing approaches to mitigate models' dependence on spurious features work in some cases, but fail in others. In this paper, we systematically analyze how and where neural networks encode spurious correlations. We introduce the neuron spurious score, an XAI-based diagnostic measure to quantify a neuron's dependence on spurious features. We analyze both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using architecture-specific methods. Our results show that spurious features are partially disentangled, but the degree of disentanglement varies across model architectures. Furthermore, we find that the assumptions behind existing mitigation methods are incomplete. Our results lay the groundwork for the development of novel methods to mitigate spurious correlations and make AI models safer to use in practice.

<title>Performance Estimation for Supervised Medical Image Segmentation Models on Unlabeled Data Using UniverSeg</title>

Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation models is usually evaluated using metrics like the Dice score and Hausdorff distance, which compare predicted masks to ground truth annotations. However, when applying the model to unseen data, such as in clinical settings, it is often impractical to annotate all the data, making the model's performance uncertain. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation Performance Evaluator (SPE), a framework for estimating segmentation models' performance on unlabeled data. This framework is adaptable to various evaluation metrics and model architectures. Experiments on six publicly available datasets across six evaluation metrics including pixel-based metrics such as Dice score and distance-based metrics like HD95, demonstrated the versatility and effectiveness of our approach, achieving a high correlation (0.956$\pm$0.046) and low MAE (0.025$\pm$0.019) compare with real Dice score on the independent test set. These results highlight its ability to reliably estimate model performance without requiring annotations. The SPE framework integrates seamlessly into any model training process without adding training overhead, enabling performance estimation and facilitating the real-world application of medical image segmentation algorithms. The source code is publicly available

Abstract: GNSS is unreliable, inaccurate, and insufficient in many real-time autonomous field applications. In this work, we present a GNSS-free global localization solution that contains a method of registering imaging radar on the ground with overhead RGB imagery, with joint optimization of relative poses from odometry and global poses from our overhead registration. Previous works have used various combinations of ground sensors and overhead imagery, and different feature extraction and matching methods. These include various handcrafted and deep-learning-based methods for extracting features from overhead imagery. Our work presents insights on extracting essential features from RGB overhead images for effective global localization against overhead imagery using only ground radar and a single georeferenced initial guess. We motivate our method by evaluating it on datasets in diverse geographic conditions and robotic platforms, including on an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) as well as urban and suburban driving datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the Visual Place Cell Encoding (VPCE) model, a biologically inspired computational framework for simulating place cell-like activation using visual input. Drawing on evidence that visual landmarks play a central role in spatial encoding, the proposed VPCE model activates visual place cells by clustering high-dimensional appearance features extracted from images captured by a robot-mounted camera. Each cluster center defines a receptive field, and activation is computed based on visual similarity using a radial basis function. We evaluate whether the resulting activation patterns correlate with key properties of biological place cells, including spatial proximity, orientation alignment, and boundary differentiation. Experiments demonstrate that the VPCE can distinguish between visually similar yet spatially distinct locations and adapt to environment changes such as the insertion or removal of walls. These results suggest that structured visual input, even in the absence of motion cues or reward-driven learning, is sufficient to generate place-cell-like spatial representations and support biologically inspired cognitive mapping.

<title>A New Graph Grammar Formalism for Robust Syntactic Pattern Recognition</title>

Abstract: I introduce a formalism for representing the syntax of recursively structured graph-like patterns. It does not use production rules, like a conventional graph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and declarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks, and parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to the grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension.
  This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them.
  The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.

Abstract: Understanding how humans leverage prior knowledge to navigate unseen environments while making exploratory decisions is essential for developing autonomous robots with similar abilities. In this work, we propose ForesightNav, a novel exploration strategy inspired by human imagination and reasoning. Our approach equips robotic agents with the capability to predict contextual information, such as occupancy and semantic details, for unexplored regions. These predictions enable the robot to efficiently select meaningful long-term navigation goals, significantly enhancing exploration in unseen environments. We validate our imagination-based approach using the Structured3D dataset, demonstrating accurate occupancy prediction and superior performance in anticipating unseen scene geometry. Our experiments show that the imagination module improves exploration efficiency in unseen environments, achieving a 100% completion rate for PointNav and an SPL of 67% for ObjectNav on the Structured3D Validation split. These contributions demonstrate the power of imagination-driven reasoning for autonomous systems to enhance generalizable and efficient exploration.

Abstract: Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.

Abstract: We provide a framework for solving inverse problems with diffusion models learned from linearly corrupted data. Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.

Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.

Abstract: Text-centric visual question answering (VQA) has made great strides with the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet open-source models still fall short of leading models like GPT4V and Gemini, partly due to a lack of extensive, high-quality instruction tuning data. To this end, we introduce a new approach for creating a massive, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset, Square-10M, which is generated using closed-source MLLMs. The data construction process, termed Square, consists of four steps: Self-Questioning, Answering, Reasoning, and Evaluation. Our experiments with Square-10M led to three key findings: 1) Our model, TextSquare, considerably surpasses open-source previous state-of-the-art Text-centric MLLMs and sets a new standard on OCRBench(62.2%). It even outperforms top-tier models like GPT4V and Gemini in 6 of 10 text-centric benchmarks. 2) Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of VQA reasoning data in offering comprehensive contextual insights for specific questions. This not only improves accuracy but also significantly mitigates hallucinations. Specifically, TextSquare scores an average of 75.1% across four general VQA and hallucination evaluation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. 3) Notably, the phenomenon observed in scaling text-centric VQA datasets reveals a vivid pattern: the exponential increase of instruction tuning data volume is directly proportional to the improvement in model performance, thereby validating the necessity of the dataset scale and the high quality of Square-10M.

Abstract: Neural implicit representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D reconstruction. However, despite their success, existing methods fail to capture fine geometric details and thin structures, especially in scenarios where only sparse multi-view RGB images of the objects of interest are available. This paper shows that training neural representations with first-order differential properties (surface normals) leads to highly accurate 3D surface reconstruction, even with as few as two RGB images. Using input RGB images, we compute approximate ground-truth surface normals from depth maps produced by an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator. During training, we directly locate the surface point of the SDF network and supervise its normal with the one estimated from the depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with a minimal number of views, capturing intricate geometric details and thin structures that were previously challenging to capture.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for the precise localization of 67 anatomical structures from single depth images captured from the exterior of the human body. Our method uses a multi-class occupancy network, trained using segmented CT scans augmented with body-pose changes, and incorporates a specialized sampling strategy to handle densely packed internal organs. Our contributions include the application of occupancy networks for occluded structure localization, a robust method for estimating anatomical positions from depth images, and the creation of detailed, individualized 3D anatomical atlases. We outperform localization using template matching and provide qualitative real-world reconstructions. This method promises improvements in automated medical imaging and diagnostic procedures by offering accurate, non-invasive localization of critical anatomical structures.

Abstract: Recently, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection technology has attracted wide-spread attention. However, due to the intrinsic feature scarcity in infrared small targets, precise segmentation of small targets from complex backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Different from most existing deep learning-based methods that focus on improving network architectures, we propose a feature-enhanced and sensitivity-tunable (FEST) framework, which is compatible with existing SIRST detection networks and further enhances their detection performance. The FEST framework improves the model's robustness from two aspects: feature enhancement and target confidence regulation. For feature enhancement, on the one hand, we adopt a multi-scale fusion strategy, which can effectively improve the model's perception and adaptability to multi-scale features of multi-size targets. On the other hand, we construct an edge enhancement difficulty mining (EEDM) loss based on the analysis of the task characteristics, which helps guide the network to continuously focus on challenging target regions and edge features during training. For target confidence regulation, we design an adjustable sensitivity (AS) strategy for network post-processing. This strategy not only enhances the adaptability of the network in complex scenarios, but also significantly improves the detection rate of infrared small targets while maintaining segmentation accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that our FEST framework can significantly enhance the performance of existing SIRST detection networks. Notably, the multi-scale direction-aware network (MSDA-Net) equipped with the FEST framework won the first prize in the PRCV 2024 wide-area infrared small target detection competition.

Abstract: Extracting polygonal building footprints from off-nadir imagery is crucial for diverse applications. Current deep-learning-based extraction approaches predominantly rely on semantic segmentation paradigms and post-processing algorithms, limiting their boundary precision and applicability. However, existing polygonal extraction methodologies are inherently designed for near-nadir imagery and fail under the geometric complexities introduced by off-nadir viewing angles. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Polygonal Footprint Network (PolyFootNet), a novel deep-learning framework that directly outputs polygonal building footprints without requiring external post-processing steps. PolyFootNet employs a High-Quality Mask Prompter to generate precise roof masks, which guide polygonal vertex extraction in a unified model pipeline. A key contribution of PolyFootNet is introducing the Self Offset Attention mechanism, grounded in Nadaraya-Watson regression, to effectively mitigate the accuracy discrepancy observed between low-rise and high-rise buildings. This approach allows low-rise building predictions to leverage angular corrections learned from high-rise building offsets, significantly enhancing overall extraction accuracy. Additionally, motivated by the inherent ambiguity of building footprint extraction tasks, we systematically investigate alternative extraction paradigms and demonstrate that a combined approach of building masks and offsets achieves superior polygonal footprint results. Extensive experiments validate PolyFootNet's effectiveness, illustrating its promising potential as a robust, generalizable, and precise polygonal building footprint extraction method from challenging off-nadir imagery. To facilitate further research, we will release pre-trained weights of our offset prediction module at https://github.com/likaiucas/PolyFootNet.

Abstract: This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W). This highlights its significant advantage in energy efficiency.

Abstract: Thermography is especially valuable for the military and other users of surveillance cameras. Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90%. Our project page is at https://thermalgaussian.github.io/.

Abstract: The large-scale training of multi-modal models on data scraped from the web has shown outstanding utility in infusing these models with the required world knowledge to perform effectively on multiple downstream tasks. However, one downside of scraping data from the web can be the potential sacrifice of the benchmarks on which the abilities of these models are often evaluated. To safeguard against test data contamination and to truly test the abilities of these foundation models we propose LiveXiv: A scalable evolving live benchmark based on scientific ArXiv papers. LiveXiv accesses domain-specific manuscripts at any given timestamp and proposes to automatically generate visual question-answer pairs (VQA). This is done without any human-in-the-loop, using the multi-modal content in the manuscripts, like graphs, charts, and tables. Moreover, we introduce an efficient evaluation approach that estimates the performance of all models on the evolving benchmark using evaluations of only a subset of models. This significantly reduces the overall evaluation cost. We benchmark multiple open and proprietary Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) on the first version of our benchmark, showing its challenging nature and exposing the models true abilities, avoiding contamination. Lastly, in our commitment to high quality, we have collected and evaluated a manually verified subset. By comparing its overall results to our automatic annotations, we have found that the performance variance is indeed minimal (<2.5%). Our dataset is available online on HuggingFace, and our code will be available here.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.

Despite progress, existing visual navigation methods struggle in map-free or off-street settings, limiting the deployment of autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a scalable, data-driven approach for human-like urban navigation by training agents on thousands of hours of in-the-wild city walking and driving videos sourced from the web. We introduce a simple and scalable data processing pipeline that extracts action supervision from these videos, enabling large-scale imitation learning without costly annotations. Our model learns sophisticated navigation policies to handle diverse challenges and critical scenarios. Experimental results show that training on large-scale, diverse datasets significantly enhances navigation performance, surpassing current methods. This work shows the potential of using abundant online video data to develop robust navigation policies for embodied agents in dynamic urban settings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel compression framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data. Building on anchor-based 3DGS methodologies, our approach compresses all attributes within each anchor by introducing a novel Hybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) to achieve hybrid lossy-lossless compression. It consists of three main components: a variable-rate predictor, a hyperprior network, and an autoregressive network. First, unlike previous methods that adopt multiple models to achieve multi-rate lossy compression, thereby increasing training overhead, our variable-rate predictor enables variable-rate compression with a single model and a hyperparameter $\lambda$ by producing a learned Quantization Step feature for versatile lossy compression. Second, to improve lossless compression, the hyperprior network captures both scene-agnostic and scene-specific features to generate a prior feature, while the autoregressive network employs an adaptive context selection algorithm with flexible receptive fields to produce a contextual feature. By integrating these two features, HEMGS can accurately estimate the distribution of the current coding element within each attribute, enabling improved entropy coding and reduced storage. We integrate HEMGS into a compression framework, and experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that HEMGS achieves about a 40% average reduction in size while maintaining rendering quality over baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.

<title>Is Large-Scale Pretraining the Secret to Good Domain Generalization?</title>

Abstract: Multi-Source Domain Generalization (DG) is the task of training on multiple source domains and achieving high classification performance on unseen target domains. Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained backbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically improved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning methods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is simply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that perceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot performance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we posit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and that it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This leads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG performance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text embeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true, and we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed datasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and Out-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on DomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP. Put together, our findings highlight the need for DG methods which can generalize beyond pretraining alignment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis, demonstrating remarkable capability in high-fidelity scene reconstruction through its Gaussian primitive representations. However, the computational overhead induced by the massive number of primitives poses a significant bottleneck to training efficiency. To overcome this challenge, we propose Group Training, a simple yet effective strategy that organizes Gaussian primitives into manageable groups, optimizing training efficiency and improving rendering quality. This approach shows universal compatibility with existing 3DGS frameworks, including vanilla 3DGS and Mip-Splatting, consistently achieving accelerated training while maintaining superior synthesis quality. Extensive experiments reveal that our straightforward Group Training strategy achieves up to 30% faster convergence and improved rendering quality across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Prompts play a critical role in unleashing the power of language and vision foundation models for specific tasks. For the first time, we introduce prompting into depth foundation models, creating a new paradigm for metric depth estimation termed Prompt Depth Anything. Specifically, we use a low-cost LiDAR as the prompt to guide the Depth Anything model for accurate metric depth output, achieving up to 4K resolution. Our approach centers on a concise prompt fusion design that integrates the LiDAR at multiple scales within the depth decoder. To address training challenges posed by limited datasets containing both LiDAR depth and precise GT depth, we propose a scalable data pipeline that includes synthetic data LiDAR simulation and real data pseudo GT depth generation. Our approach sets new state-of-the-arts on the ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ datasets and benefits downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction and generalized robotic grasping.

Abstract: We introduce SWITCH-A-VIEW, a model that learns to automatically select the viewpoint to display at each timepoint when creating a how-to video. The key insight of our approach is how to train such a model from unlabeled -- but human-edited -- video samples. We pose a pretext task that pseudo-labels segments in the training videos for their primary viewpoint (egocentric or exocentric), and then discovers the patterns between the visual and spoken content in a how-to video on the one hand and its view-switch moments on the other hand. Armed with this predictor, our model can be applied to new multi-view video settings for orchestrating which viewpoint should be displayed when, even when such settings come with limited labels. We demonstrate our idea on a variety of real-world videos from HowTo100M and Ego-Exo4D, and rigorously validate its advantages. Project: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/switch_a_view/.

Abstract: Recent advancements in scene text spotting have focused on end-to-end methodologies that heavily rely on precise location annotations, which are often costly and labor-intensive to procure. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages only transcription annotations for training text spotting models, substantially reducing the dependency on elaborate annotation processes. Our methodology employs a query-based paradigm that facilitates the learning of implicit location features through the interaction between text queries and image embeddings. These features are later refined during the text recognition phase using an attention activation map. Addressing the challenges associated with training a weakly-supervised model from scratch, we implement a circular curriculum learning strategy to enhance model convergence. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine cross-attention localization mechanism for more accurate text instance localization. Notably, our framework supports audio-based annotation, which significantly diminishes annotation time and provides an inclusive alternative for individuals with disabilities. Our approach achieves competitive performance against existing benchmarks, demonstrating that high accuracy in text spotting can be attained without extensive location annotations.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Methods based on synthetic data are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data but require a high degree of realism and controllability in order to be useful. This paper introduces MObI, a novel framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to create realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated for both camera and lidar simultaneously. Using a single reference RGB image, MObI enables objects to be seamlessly inserted into existing multimodal scenes at a 3D location specified by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, our 3D bounding box conditioning gives objects accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. As a result, our approach can be used to insert novel objects flexibly into multimodal scenes, providing significant advantages for testing perception models.

Abstract: Recognizing the same faces with and without masks is important for ensuring consistent identification in security, access control, and public safety. This capability is crucial in scenarios like law enforcement, healthcare, and surveillance, where accurate recognition must be maintained despite facial occlusion. This research focuses on the challenge of recognizing the same faces with and without masks by employing cosine similarity as the primary technique. With the increased use of masks, traditional facial recognition systems face significant accuracy issues, making it crucial to develop methods that can reliably identify individuals in masked conditions. For that reason, this study proposed Masked-Unmasked Face Matching Model (MUFM). This model employs transfer learning using the Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) model to extract significant facial features, which are subsequently classified utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The cosine similarity metric is employed to compare masked and unmasked faces of the same individuals. This approach represents a novel contribution, as the task of recognizing the same individual with and without a mask using cosine similarity has not been previously addressed. By integrating these advanced methodologies, the research demonstrates effective identification of individuals despite the presence of masks, addressing a significant limitation in traditional systems. Using data is another essential part of this work, by collecting and preparing an image dataset from three different sources especially some of those data are real provided a comprehensive power of this research. The image dataset used were already collected in three different datasets of masked and unmasked for the same faces.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.

Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exposes critical safety gaps in their alignment mechanisms. While existing jailbreak studies primarily focus on VLMs' susceptibility to harmful instructions, we reveal a fundamental yet overlooked vulnerability: toxic text continuation, where VLMs produce highly toxic completions when prompted with harmful text prefixes paired with semantically adversarial images. To systematically study this threat, we propose Red Team Diffuser (RTD), the first red teaming diffusion model that coordinates adversarial image generation and toxic continuation through reinforcement learning. Our key innovations include dynamic cross-modal attack and stealth-aware optimization. For toxic text prefixes from an LLM safety benchmark, we conduct greedy search to identify optimal image prompts that maximally induce toxic completions. The discovered image prompts then drive RL-based diffusion model fine-tuning, producing semantically aligned adversarial images that boost toxicity rates. Stealth-aware optimization introduces joint adversarial rewards that balance toxicity maximization (via Detoxify classifier) and stealthiness (via BERTScore), circumventing traditional noise-based adversarial patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RTD, increasing the toxicity rate of LLaVA outputs by 10.69% over text-only baselines on the original attack set and 8.91% on an unseen set, proving generalization capability. Moreover, RTD exhibits strong cross-model transferability, raising the toxicity rate by 5.1% on Gemini and 26.83% on LLaMA. Our findings expose two critical flaws in current VLM alignment: (1) failure to prevent toxic continuation from harmful prefixes, and (2) overlooking cross-modal attack vectors. These results necessitate a paradigm shift toward multimodal red teaming in safety evaluations.

Abstract: Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/wusize/Harmon.

However, recent advancements in VPR methods have significantly improved performance, challenging the necessity of re-ranking. In this work, we show that modern retrieval systems often reach a point where re-ranking can degrade results, as current VPR datasets are largely saturated. We propose using image matching as a verification step to assess retrieval confidence, demonstrating that inlier counts can reliably predict when re-ranking is beneficial. Our findings shift the paradigm of retrieval pipelines, offering insights for more robust and adaptive VPR systems. The code is available at https://github.com/FarInHeight/To-Match-or-Not-to-Match.

Abstract: Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot, bringing convenience to polarization-based downstream tasks. However, their direct outputs are color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw images, requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution, full-color polarized images; unfortunately, this necessary step introduces artifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides, limited by the hardware design, the resolution of a polarization camera is often much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized image demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance resolution, while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods, though designed to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing results, tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by demosaicing artifacts. In this paper, we propose PIDSR, a joint framework that performs complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution, showing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with more accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner. Experiments show our PIDSR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real data, but also facilitates downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pre-trained models showed promising results in few-shot learning. However, their generalization ability on two-dimensional Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, i.e., correlation shift and diversity shift, has not been thoroughly investigated. Researches have shown that even with a significant amount of training data, few methods can achieve better performance than the standard empirical risk minimization method (ERM) in OoD generalization. This few-shot OoD generalization dilemma emerges as a challenging direction in deep neural network generalization research, where the performance suffers from overfitting on few-shot examples and OoD generalization errors. In this paper, leveraging a broader supervision source, we explore a novel Bayesian cross-modal image-text alignment learning method (Bayes-CAL) to address this issue. Specifically, the model is designed as only text representations are fine-tuned via a Bayesian modelling approach with gradient orthogonalization loss and invariant risk minimization (IRM) loss. The Bayesian approach is essentially introduced to avoid overfitting the base classes observed during training and improve generalization to broader unseen classes. The dedicated loss is introduced to achieve better image-text alignment by disentangling the causal and non-casual parts of image features. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Bayes-CAL achieved state-of-the-art OoD generalization performances on two-dimensional distribution shifts. Moreover, compared with CLIP-like models, Bayes-CAL yields more stable generalization performances on unseen classes. Our code is available at https://github.com/LinLLLL/BayesCAL.

Abstract: Language-based foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) or large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely studied in long-tailed recognition. However, the need for linguistic data is not applicable to all practical tasks. In this study, we aim to explore using large vision models (LVMs) or visual foundation models (VFMs) to enhance long-tailed data features without any language information. Specifically, we extract features from the LVM and fuse them with features in the baseline network's map and latent space to obtain the augmented features. Moreover, we design several prototype-based losses in the latent space to further exploit the potential of the augmented features. In the experimental section, we validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018.

Abstract: Current self-supervised methods, such as contrastive learning, predominantly focus on global discrimination, neglecting the critical fine-grained anatomical details required for accurate radiographic analysis. To address this challenge, we propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised framework for enhancing Fine-grained Representation in radiographic image analysis (AFiRe). The core idea of AFiRe is to align the anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifically, AFiRe synergistically performs two self-supervised schemes: (i) Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learning, which aligns image tokens based on structural and categorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained spatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removal restoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies, thereby refining the learned discrimination with detailed geometrical information. Additionally, we propose Synthetic Lesion Mask to enhance anatomical diversity while preserving intra-consistency, which is typically corrupted by traditional data augmentations, such as Cropping and Affine transformations. Experimental results show that AFiRe: (i) provides robust anatomical discrimination, achieving more cohesive feature clusters compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods; (ii) demonstrates superior generalization, surpassing 7 radiography-specific self-supervised methods in multi-label classification tasks with limited labeling; and (iii) integrates fine-grained information, enabling precise anomaly detection using only image-level annotations.

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reduces radiation exposure by acquiring fewer projections, making it a valuable tool in clinical scenarios where low-dose radiation is essential. However, this often results in increased noise and artifacts due to limited data. In this paper we propose a novel 3D Gaussian representation (3DGR) based method for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Inspired by recent success in novel view synthesis driven by 3D Gaussian splatting, we leverage the efficiency and expressiveness of 3D Gaussian representation as an alternative to implicit neural representation. To unleash the potential of 3DGR for CT imaging scenario, we propose two key innovations: (i) FBP-image-guided Guassian initialization and (ii) efficient integration with a differentiable CT projector. Extensive experiments and ablations on diverse datasets demonstrate the proposed 3DGR-CT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterpart methods, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy with faster convergence. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of 3DGR-CT for real-time physical simulation, which holds important clinical applications while challenging for implicit neural representations.

<title>A Scoping Review of Earth Observation and Machine Learning for Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data such as satellite imagery can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty, especially when coupled with machine learning (ML) and computer vision. Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.

Abstract: Time-to-Collision (TTC) estimation lies in the core of the forward collision warning (FCW) functionality, which is key to all Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems. Although the success of solutions using frame-based cameras (e.g., Mobileye's solutions) has been witnessed in normal situations, some extreme cases, such as the sudden variation in the relative speed of leading vehicles and the sudden appearance of pedestrians, still pose significant risks that cannot be handled. This is due to the inherent imaging principles of frame-based cameras, where the time interval between adjacent exposures introduces considerable system latency to AEB. Event cameras, as a novel bio-inspired sensor, offer ultra-high temporal resolution and can asynchronously report brightness changes at the microsecond level. To explore the potential of event cameras in the above-mentioned challenging cases, we propose EvTTC, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-sensor dataset focusing on TTC tasks under high-relative-speed scenarios. EvTTC consists of data collected using standard cameras and event cameras, covering various potential collision scenarios in daily driving and involving multiple collision objects. Additionally, LiDAR and GNSS/INS measurements are provided for the calculation of ground-truth TTC. Considering the high cost of testing TTC algorithms on full-scale mobile platforms, we also provide a small-scale TTC testbed for experimental validation and data augmentation. All the data and the design of the testbed are open sourced, and they can serve as a benchmark that will facilitate the development of vision-based TTC techniques.

Abstract: RISC-V-based architectures are paving the way for efficient On-Device Learning (ODL) in smart edge devices. When applied across multiple nodes, ODL enables the creation of intelligent sensor networks that preserve data privacy. However, developing ODL-capable, battery-operated embedded platforms presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources and limited device lifetime, besides intrinsic learning issues such as catastrophic forgetting. We face these challenges by proposing a regularization-based On-Device Federated Continual Learning algorithm tailored for multiple nano-drones performing face recognition tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a RISC-V-based 10-core ultra-low-power SoC, optimizing the ODL computational requirements. We improve the classification accuracy by 24% over naive fine-tuning, requiring 178 ms per local epoch and 10.5 s per global epoch, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecture for this task.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation in complex indoor environments. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware localization method that enhances the reliability of localization outputs without modifying the prediction model itself. This study introduces a percentile-based rejection strategy that filters out unreliable 3-DoF pose predictions based on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties the network estimates. We apply this approach to a multi-modal end-to-end localization that fuses RGB images and 2D LiDAR data, and we evaluate it across three real-world datasets collected using a commercialized serving robot. Experimental results show that applying stricter uncertainty thresholds consistently improves pose accuracy. Specifically, the mean position error is reduced by 41.0%, 56.7%, and 69.4%, and the mean orientation error by 55.6%, 65.7%, and 73.3%, when applying 90%, 80%, and 70% thresholds, respectively. Furthermore, the rejection strategy effectively removes extreme outliers, resulting in better alignment with ground truth trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively demonstrate the benefits of percentile-based uncertainty rejection in multi-modal end-to-end localization tasks. Our approach provides a practical means to enhance the reliability and accuracy of localization systems in real-world deployments.

Abstract: We introduce ProVideLLM, an end-to-end framework for real-time procedural video understanding. ProVideLLM integrates a multimodal cache configured to store two types of tokens - verbalized text tokens, which provide compressed textual summaries of long-term observations, and visual tokens, encoded with DETR-QFormer to capture fine-grained details from short-term observations. This design reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one hour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of the present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM ensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling per-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with a minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint. ProVideLLM also sets new state-of-the-art results on six procedural tasks across four datasets.

<div> keywords: guidance techniques, conditional generative tasks, image quality, diversity, consistency <br />
Summary:
Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG) introduces a new guidance mechanism for diffusion and flow models, aiming to improve image quality, diversity, and consistency simultaneously. By leveraging changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, ERG achieves significant enhancements in various generative tasks like text-to-image, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation. Unlike existing techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), ERG does not require additional models or multiple forward passes per sampling step, making it simpler and more efficient. ERG is a versatile method that can be combined seamlessly with other guidance techniques like CADS and APG to further enhance generation performance across different tasks and scenarios. Overall, ERG offers a straightforward yet effective approach to enhancing image generation quality and diversity while ensuring prompt consistency, making it a valuable addition to the field of generative modeling. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) -- the most widely adopted guidance technique -- contrasts conditional and unconditional predictions to improve the generated images. This results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency, improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance mechanism based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. ERG results in significant improvements in various generation tasks such as text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further boosting generation performance.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Neural Radiance Fields, LLaNA, NeRF captioning, NeRF-language tasks

Summary:
LLaNA is a new Multimodal Large Language Model that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to understand both images and 3D data with improved accuracy. It can perform tasks like NeRF captioning and Q&amp;A by directly processing the weights of a NeRF's Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). LLaNA does not require rendering images or creating 3D structures to extract object information. The creation of a large-scale NeRF-language dataset with over 300K NeRFs from ShapeNet and Objaverse with textual annotations enables various NeRF-language tasks. A benchmark based on this dataset shows that processing NeRF weights directly leads to better performance in NeRF-language tasks compared to methods using traditional 2D or 3D representations. This integration of NeRFs into MLLMs shows promise in advancing understanding of object geometry and appearance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding both images and 3D data, yet these modalities face inherent limitations in comprehensively representing object geometry and appearance. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising alternative, encoding both geometric and photorealistic properties within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This work investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRFs into an MLLM. We introduce LLaNA, the first MLLM able to perform new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&amp;A, by directly processing the weights of a NeRF's MLP. Notably, LLaNA is able to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. In addition, we build the first large-scale NeRF-language dataset, composed by more than 300K NeRFs trained on ShapeNet and Objaverse, with paired textual annotations that enable various NeRF-language tasks. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that directly processing NeRF weights leads to better performance on NeRF-Language tasks compared to approaches that rely on either 2D or 3D representations derived from NeRFs.

Summary:
Fashion industry has been increasingly using AI technologies for virtual try-on and fashion image editing. Existing methods often require specific garment input, which may not be practical. This work introduces Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG) to customize fashion items based on user-provided textual preferences. This method retrieves multiple garments matching the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. Textual inversion techniques are employed to integrate retrieved elements seamlessly into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset show that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods in capturing fine-grained visual details. This is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.

In this work, the authors propose a new approach to enhance feature upsampling in vision foundation models (VFMs) for pixel-level understanding tasks. They introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer and a training objective that leverages class-agnostic masks and self-distillation to generate high-quality, sharp features.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINOv2 and CLIP have achieved impressive results on various downstream tasks, but their limited feature resolution hampers performance in applications requiring pixel-level understanding. Feature upsampling offers a promising direction to address this challenge. In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details and adapts flexibly to various input and feature resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing feature upsampling techniques across various downstream tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/andrehuang/loftup.

<br />
Summary: The article introduces a new approach called Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS), which combines relative depth ordering and instance segmentation based on occlusions to provide 3D information from a single image. By leveraging the simpler task of occlusion-based relative depth ordering, OOSIS offers a more reliable method for obtaining 3D information compared to absolute monocular depth estimation. The proposed approach simultaneously extracts instances and their occlusion order from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation, simplifying the task as a labeling problem. A novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach is developed, outperforming previous methods. A new joint OOSIS metric, combining instance mask accuracy and occlusion order correctness, is introduced to evaluate performance. The article demonstrates improved results on KINS and COCOA datasets compared to strong baselines.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard semantic instance segmentation provides useful, but inherently 2D information from a single image. To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces SG-LLIE, a new approach to Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) that combines a multi-scale CNN-Transformer hybrid framework guided by structure priors. Instead of relying on pre-trained models for semantics or illumination maps, SG-LLIE extracts robust structure priors using illumination-invariant edge detectors. The framework includes a Structure-Guided Transformer Block (SGTB) in each Hybrid Structure-Guided Feature Extractor (HSGFE) module to incorporate structural priors in the enhancement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-LLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various LLIE benchmarks in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality. The solution also ranks second in the NTIRE 2025 Low-Light Enhancement Challenge. Code for SG-LLIE is available on GitHub at https://github.com/minyan8/imagine. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) techniques predominantly rely on either direct Low-Light (LL) to Normal-Light (NL) mappings or guidance from semantic features or illumination maps. Nonetheless, the intrinsic ill-posedness of LLIE and the difficulty in retrieving robust semantics from heavily corrupted images hinder their effectiveness in extremely low-light environments. To tackle this challenge, we present SG-LLIE, a new multi-scale CNN-Transformer hybrid framework guided by structure priors. Different from employing pre-trained models for the extraction of semantics or illumination maps, we choose to extract robust structure priors based on illumination-invariant edge detectors. Moreover, we develop a CNN-Transformer Hybrid Structure-Guided Feature Extractor (HSGFE) module at each scale with in the UNet encoder-decoder architecture. Besides the CNN blocks which excels in multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, we introduce a Structure-Guided Transformer Block (SGTB) in each HSGFE that incorporates structural priors to modulate the enhancement process. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several LLIE benchmarks in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Our solution ranks second in the NTIRE 2025 Low-Light Enhancement Challenge. Code is released at https://github.com/minyan8/imagine.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved notable progress in shadow removal, many existing approaches rely on shadow masks that are difficult to obtain, limiting their generalization to real-world scenes. In this work, we propose ReHiT, an efficient mask-free shadow removal framework based on a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture guided by Retinex theory. We first introduce a dual-branch pipeline to separately model reflectance and illumination components, and each is restored by our developed Illumination-Guided Hybrid CNN-Transformer (IG-HCT) module. Second, besides the CNN-based blocks that are capable of learning residual dense features and performing multi-scale semantic fusion, multi-scale semantic fusion, we develop the Illumination-Guided Histogram Transformer Block (IGHB) to effectively handle non-uniform illumination and spatially complex shadows. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing mask-free methods. Trained solely on the NTIRE 2025 Shadow Removal Challenge dataset, our solution delivers competitive results with one of the smallest parameter sizes and fastest inference speeds among top-ranked entries, highlighting its applicability for real-world applications with limited computational resources.

Summary:<br />
VideoPASTA is a framework designed to enhance Video-LLMs by focusing on targeted preference optimization. By training models to differentiate accurate video representations from purposely created adversarial examples that violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relations, VideoPASTA improves the performance of video-language models.

Experimental results on various video benchmarks show significant relative performance gains over baseline models, without requiring human annotation or extensive preprocessing. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while maintaining their capabilities. VideoPASTA proves that targeted alignment can effectively address core video-language challenges without the need for massive pretraining or architectural modifications. <div>

Abstract: Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully generated adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relations. By applying Direct Preference Optimization to just 7,020 preference pairs, VideoPASTA learns robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial relationships and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments on standard video benchmarks show significant relative performance gains of 3.05% on VideoMME, 1.97% on NeXTQA, and 1.31% on LongVideoBench, over the baseline Qwen2.5-VL model. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without human annotation or captioning, relying on just 32-frame sampling, compared to the 96-frame, multi-GPU setups of prior work. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable, plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their capabilities.

Abstract: We present DanceText, a training-free framework for multilingual text editing in images, designed to support complex geometric transformations and achieve seamless foreground-background integration. While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in text-guided image synthesis, they often lack controllability and fail to preserve layout consistency under non-trivial manipulations such as rotation, translation, scaling, and warping. To address these limitations, DanceText introduces a layered editing strategy that separates text from the background, allowing geometric transformations to be performed in a modular and controllable manner. A depth-aware module is further proposed to align appearance and perspective between the transformed text and the reconstructed background, enhancing photorealism and spatial consistency. Importantly, DanceText adopts a fully training-free design by integrating pretrained modules, allowing flexible deployment without task-specific fine-tuning.

Summary: <br />
Road environment segmentation is crucial in autonomous driving, with approaches utilizing Fully Convolutional Networks and Transformer architectures to improve accuracy. However, these methods may struggle with the discrete information required for efficient segmentation. To address this, vector quantization is proposed, offering advantages such as mapping continuous features to discrete vectors from a codebook and compressing noise in representations. By combining vector quantization with the MobileUNETR model, significant improvements in segmentation performance were achieved without increasing complexity. Experimental results on Cityscapes demonstrate an mIoU of 77.0%, outperforming the baseline by 2.9%. This approach encourages structured representations, enabling the model to effectively group similar features and enhance segmentation accuracy. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Road environment segmentation plays a significant role in autonomous driving. Numerous works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Transformer architectures have been proposed to leverage local and global contextual learning for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. In both architectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous representations from the image, which limits the ability to represent meaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose segmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization. Vector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment segmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a discrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features more easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature acts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also compress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task. (3) Vector quantization encourages the latent space to form coarse clusters of continuous features, forcing the model to group similar features, making the learned representations more structured for the decoding process. In this work, we combined vector quantization with the lightweight image segmentation model MobileUNETR and used it as a baseline model for comparison to demonstrate its efficiency. Through experiments, we achieved 77.0 % mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the baseline by 2.9 % without increasing the model's initial size or complexity.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel bi-modal guided multi-perspective representation learning framework for zero-shot deepfake attribution. It addresses the challenge of tracing the source of forged faces by leveraging multi-modal information such as vision, text, and face parsing. The proposed framework includes a multi-perspective visual encoder to capture deepfake visual characteristics across different views, a parsing encoder for global face attribute embeddings, and a language encoder for fine-grained language embeddings. The framework also introduces a deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to enhance traceability by pulling relevant generators closer and pushing irrelevant ones away. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the zero-shot deepfake attribution task. <div>

Abstract: The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen generators in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-modal guided multi-perspective representation learning (BMRL) framework for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA), which facilitates effective traceability to unseen generators. Specifically, we design a multi-perspective visual encoder (MPVE) to explore general deepfake attribution visual characteristics across three views (i.e., image, noise, and edge). We devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via vision-parsing matching. A language encoder is proposed to capture fine-grained language embeddings, facilitating language-guided general visual forgery representation learning through vision-language alignment. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center (DFACC) loss, to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA task through various protocols evaluation.

Summary:
- The study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified U-Net and custom loss function for chemical map generation from hyperspectral images.
- U-Net outperforms traditional PLS regression in mean fat prediction, achieving 9-13% lower root mean squared error.
- The U-Net generates spatially correlated chemical maps with fine details, while PLS predictions are largely independent of neighboring pixels.
- U-Net stays within the physically possible fat content range of 0-100%, unlike PLS-generated maps.
- Overall, U-Net is deemed superior to PLS regression for chemical map generation tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated remarkable success in 3D point cloud analysis, particularly through masked autoencoders (MAEs). However, existing MAE-based methods lack rotation invariance, leading to significant performance degradation when processing arbitrarily rotated point clouds in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Handcrafted Feature-Based Rotation-Invariant Masked Autoencoder (HFBRI-MAE), a novel framework that refines the MAE design with rotation-invariant handcrafted features to ensure stable feature learning across different orientations. By leveraging both rotation-invariant local and global features for token embedding and position embedding, HFBRI-MAE effectively eliminates rotational dependencies while preserving rich geometric structures. Additionally, we redefine the reconstruction target to a canonically aligned version of the input, mitigating rotational ambiguities. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that HFBRI-MAE consistently outperforms existing methods in object classification, segmentation, and few-shot learning, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization ability in real-world 3D applications.

Summary:
The study focuses on the importance of semantic feature quality and quantity in multi-target adversarial attacks and introduces the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework. They find that the completeness and sufficiency of implanted target features significantly impact attack success. The 2D-TGAF framework utilizes diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors, improving attack success rates. A novel masking strategy is also introduced to retain complete semantic information in the generated noise. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that 2D-TGAF outperforms existing methods on both normally trained models and various defense mechanisms. <div>
arXiv:2504.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to single-target adversarial attacks, multi-target attacks have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate adversarial images for multiple target classes simultaneously. Existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of target labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking practical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Image-based crack detection algorithms are increasingly in demand in infrastructure monitoring, as early detection of cracks is of paramount importance for timely maintenance planning. While deep learning has significantly advanced crack detection algorithms, existing models often require extensive labeled datasets and high computational costs for fine-tuning, limiting their adaptability across diverse conditions. This study introduces an efficient selective fine-tuning strategy, focusing on tuning normalization components, to enhance the adaptability of segmentation models for crack detection. The proposed method is applied to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and five well-established segmentation models. Experimental results demonstrate that selective fine-tuning of only normalization parameters outperforms full fine-tuning and other common fine-tuning techniques in both performance and computational efficiency, while improving generalization. The proposed approach yields a SAM-based model, Segment Any Crack (SAC), achieving a 61.22\% F1-score and 44.13\% IoU on the OmniCrack30k benchmark dataset, along with the highest performance across three zero-shot datasets and the lowest standard deviation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the adaptation approach in improving segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Key to our approach is 3D-JEPA, a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm applicable to sensor point clouds. It takes as input a 3D pointcloud featurized using 2D foundation models (CLIP, DINO). Subsequently, masked prediction in latent space is employed as a pretext task to aid the self-supervised learning of contextualized pointcloud features. Once trained, the 3D-JEPA encoder is finetuned alongside a language-conditioned decoder to jointly predict 3D masks and bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce LOCATE 3D DATASET, a new dataset for 3D referential grounding, spanning multiple capture setups with over 130K annotations.

Summary:
Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO) is introduced as a framework to enhance In-context learning (ICL) performance for image classification tasks. It leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset by using visual features as keys. This approach helps to select representative samples for update under low computational cost. The method significantly improves ICL performance for image classification, with an average improvement of more than 20%. Experiment results on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of KeCO. Particularly, the framework performs well in a simulated online scenario, showcasing its practical value for resource-constrained real-world applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of traditional coreset selection strategies and shows promise for enhancing the adaptability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) without parameter updates. <div>
arXiv:2504.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, using a few demonstrations from a large support set. However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for ID-preserving generation using a multi-modal encoding strategy rather than injecting identity features via adapters into pre-trained models. Our method treats identity and text as a unified conditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). Compared to prior methods, FaceCLIP-SDXL enables photorealistic portrait generation with better identity preservation and textual relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its quantitative and qualitative superiority.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Open-Set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods using CLIP face significant issues: (1) while heavily dependent on domain-specific threshold selection, existing methods employ simple fixed thresholds, underutilizing CLIP's zero-shot potential in SF-OSDA scenarios; and (2) overlook intrinsic class tendencies while employing complex training to enforce feature separation, incurring deployment costs and feature shifts that compromise CLIP's generalization ability. To address these issues, we propose CLIPXpert, a novel SF-OSDA approach that integrates two key components: an adaptive thresholding strategy and an unknown class feature filtering module. Specifically, the Box-Cox GMM-Based Adaptive Thresholding (BGAT) module dynamically determines the optimal threshold by estimating sample score distributions, balancing known class recognition and unknown class sample detection. Additionally, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-Based Unknown-Class Feature Filtering (SUFF) module reduces the tendency of unknown class samples towards known classes, improving the separation between known and unknown classes. Experiments show that our source-free and training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art trained approach UOTA by 1.92% on the DomainNet dataset, achieves SOTA-comparable performance on datasets such as Office-Home, and surpasses other SF-OSDA methods. This not only validates the effectiveness of our proposed method but also highlights CLIP's strong zero-shot potential for SF-OSDA tasks.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are widely used for vision tasks and can also be beneficial for 3D tasks utilizing cross-modal information. This study focuses on adapting VFMs for LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation from labeled source to unlabeled target data. The method utilizes paired 2D-3D data to train a 3D backbone with a fusion network guided by image and point cloud streams. Results show significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 6.5 mIoU improvement over various tasks. <div>

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have become a de facto choice for many downstream vision tasks, like image classification, image segmentation, and object localization. However, they can also provide significant utility for downstream 3D tasks that can leverage the cross-modal information (e.g., from paired image data). In our work, we further explore the utility of VFMs for adapting from a labeled source to unlabeled target data for the task of LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consumes paired 2D-3D (image and point cloud) data and relies on the robust (cross-domain) features from a VFM to train a 3D backbone on a mix of labeled source and unlabeled target data. At the heart of our method lies a fusion network that is guided by both the image and point cloud streams, with their relative contributions adjusted based on the target domain. We extensively compare our proposed methodology with different state-of-the-art methods in several settings and achieve strong performance gains. For example, achieving an average improvement of 6.5 mIoU (over all tasks), when compared with the previous state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Reflective documents often suffer from specular highlights under ambient lighting, severely hindering text readability and degrading overall visual quality. Although recent deep learning methods show promise in highlight removal, they remain suboptimal for document images, primarily due to the lack of dedicated datasets and tailored architectural designs. To tackle these challenges, we present DocHR14K, a large-scale real-world dataset comprising 14,902 high-resolution image pairs across six document categories and various lighting conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution dataset for document highlight removal that captures a wide range of real-world lighting conditions. Additionally, motivated by the observation that the residual map between highlighted and clean images naturally reveals the spatial structure of highlight regions, we propose a simple yet effective Highlight Location Prior (HLP) to estimate highlight masks without human annotations. Building on this prior, we present the Location-Aware Laplacian Pyramid Highlight Removal Network (L2HRNet), which effectively removes highlights by leveraging estimated priors and incorporates diffusion module to restore details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DocHR14K improves highlight removal under diverse lighting conditions. Our L2HRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, including a 5.01\% increase in PSNR and a 13.17\% reduction in RMSE on DocHR14K.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel Region of Interest (ROI)-guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression (RPCGC) method for efficient storage and transmission of point cloud data. Using a dual-branch parallel structure, the framework encodes a simplified version of the point cloud in the base layer and refines it focusing on geometry details in the enhancement layer. The residual information from the enhancement layer is refined through an ROI prediction network, generating mask information for better compression. The incorporation of mask details in the Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization process, with point weighting in distortion calculation, enhances compression performance.

Abstract: Point cloud data is pivotal in applications like autonomous driving, virtual reality, and robotics. However, its substantial volume poses significant challenges in storage and transmission. In order to obtain a high compression ratio, crucial semantic details usually confront severe damage, leading to difficulties in guaranteeing the accuracy of downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we are the first to introduce a novel Region of Interest (ROI)-guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression (RPCGC) method for human and machine vision. Our framework employs a dual-branch parallel structure, where the base layer encodes and decodes a simplified version of the point cloud, and the enhancement layer refines this by focusing on geometry details. Furthermore, the residual information of the enhancement layer undergoes refinement through an ROI prediction network. This network generates mask information, which is then incorporated into the residuals, serving as a strong supervision signal. Additionally, we intricately apply these mask details in the Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization process, with each point weighted in the distortion calculation. Our loss function includes RD loss and detection loss to better guide point cloud encoding for the machine. Experiment results demonstrate that RPCGC achieves exceptional compression performance and better detection accuracy (10% gain) than some learning-based compression methods at high bitrates in ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.

Summary:  
Progress in image generation has raised concerns about the spread of fake images, prompting the need for effective detection methods. Traditional approaches to fake image detection lack transparency and may not generalize well. This study explores the use of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. The researchers compared the performance of MLLMs against traditional methods and human evaluators, identifying the strengths and limitations of each. By designing six distinct prompts and integrating them into a comprehensive framework, they propose a more robust and explainable fake image detection system. The code for this framework is publicly available, offering a valuable resource for further research and development in this area. The results highlight the potential of MLLMs in enhancing the detection of fake images while ensuring transparency and reasoning-driven decision-making.

Abstract: Progress in image generation raises significant public security concerns. We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system.

<div> Keywords: image restoration, efficient model, joint embedding mechanism, spatial-frequency fusion, all-in-one restoration

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called AnyIR for efficiently restoring degraded images using a single model. Unlike traditional methods that require separate models for each type of degradation, AnyIR utilizes a unified approach by leveraging similarities across various types of degradations. The approach involves sub-latent space analysis, reweighting key components in a gated manner, and employing a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy to enhance restoration details. Through extensive benchmarking, AnyIR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing model complexity significantly. The approach reduces parameters by 82% and floating-point operations by 85%. The code for AnyIR will be available on the project page for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring any degraded image efficiently via just one model has become increasingly significant and impactful, especially with the proliferation of mobile devices. Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs. Our code will be available at our Project page (https://amazingren.github.io/AnyIR/)

arXiv:2504.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vein recognition technologies have become one of the primary solutions for high-security identification systems. However, the issue of biometric information leakage can still pose a serious threat to user privacy and anonymity. Currently, there is no cancelable biometric template generation scheme specifically designed for vein biometrics. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative cancelable vein biometric generation scheme: ColorVein. Unlike previous cancelable template generation schemes, ColorVein does not destroy the original biometric features and introduces additional color information to grayscale vein images. This method significantly enhances the information density of vein images by transforming static grayscale information into dynamically controllable color representations through interactive colorization. ColorVein allows users/administrators to define a controllable pseudo-random color space for grayscale vein images by editing the position, number, and color of hint points, thereby generating protected cancelable templates. Additionally, we propose a new secure center loss to optimize the training process of the protected feature extraction model, effectively increasing the feature distance between enrolled users and any potential impostors. Finally, we evaluate ColorVein's performance on all types of vein biometrics, including recognition performance, unlinkability, irreversibility, and revocability, and conduct security and privacy analyses. ColorVein achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: Co-salient object detection, parameter-efficient, visual consensus prompts, prompt tuning paradigm, state of the art

Summary: 
Existing co-salient object detection methods often face limitations in timely guidance and parameter inefficiency. To address these issues, a new concise architecture is proposed for the CoSOD task. This architecture introduces a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and incorporates consensus into prompts to create task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). The purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) focuses on co-salient representations with limited tunable parameters to generate consensus prompts. The Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) utilizes these prompts to enhance pre-trained models for CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments show that the VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge models, achieving a new state of the art on the challenging CoCA dataset with a 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics. Source code is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a three-stage architecture (i.e., encoding, consensus extraction & dispersion, and prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they yield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key limitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts, thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

Summary: <br />
The article introduces CrossWKV, a new cross-attention mechanism that enhances the state-based RWKV-7 model's capability for text-to-image generation. By integrating text and image modalities in a single pass, CrossWKV utilizes a generalized delta rule with vector-valued gating and low-rank adaptations to achieve superior cross-modal alignment.

The model demonstrates proficiency in state-tracking tasks such as $S_5$ permutation modeling and achieves competitive performance on datasets like LAION-5B and ImageNet. With a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.88 and a CLIP score of 0.33 on ImageNet 256x256, CrossWKV matches state-of-the-art performance while offering robust generalization across diverse prompts. Its enhanced expressivity, combined with constant memory usage and linear scaling, make it a potent solution for advanced cross-modal tasks with potential applications in high-resolution generation and dynamic state manipulation. <br /> <div>

Summary: 
The article introduces TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. This model leverages multimodal learning by integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues to accurately predict saliency maps in videos. By treating saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on multiple modalities, TAVDiff utilizes a saliency-oriented image-text response mechanism to guide the model in localizing visually semantically relevant regions indicated by textual descriptions. The auditory modality is also utilized to focus on salient regions suggested by sound sources. To improve conditional guidance, Saliency-DiT decouples conditional information from timesteps in the diffusion transformer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TAVDiff, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics such as SIM, CC, NSS, and AUC-J. This comprehensive approach showcases the potential of multimodal learning in enhancing video saliency prediction accuracy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces RAMCT, a region-adaptive sparse correlation filter tracker that enhances thermal infrared target tracking accuracy. By utilizing a spatially adaptive binary mask, it enforces sparsity in the target region and suppresses background interference effectively. The integration of generalized singular value decomposition allows for robust optimization across multiple channels, improving resilience to occlusion and background variations. An online optimization strategy with dynamic parameter adjustment ensures real-time adaptation to target and background changes, enhancing tracking accuracy and robustness significantly.

Abstract: Correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have gained significant attention for their computational efficiency in thermal infrared (TIR) target tracking. However, ex-isting methods struggle with challenges such as low-resolution imagery, occlu-sion, background clutter, and target deformation, which severely impact tracking performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAMCT, a region-adaptive sparse correlation filter tracker that integrates multi-channel feature opti-mization with an adaptive regularization strategy. Firstly, we refine the CF learn-ing process by introducing a spatially adaptive binary mask, which enforces spar-sity in the target region while dynamically suppressing background interference. Secondly, we introduce generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and propose a novel GSVD-based region-adaptive iterative Tikhonov regularization method. This enables flexible and robust optimization across multiple feature channels, improving resilience to occlusion and background variations. Thirdly, we propose an online optimization strategy with dynamic discrepancy-based pa-rameter adjustment. This mechanism facilitates real time adaptation to target and background variations, thereby improving tracking accuracy and robustness. Ex-tensive experiments on LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that RAMCT outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As machine learning evolves, domain generalization (DG) and domain adaptation (DA) have become crucial for enhancing model robustness across diverse environments. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) plays a significant role in these tasks, offering powerful zero-shot capabilities that allow models to perform effectively in unseen domains. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature, as no comprehensive survey currently exists that systematically explores the applications of CLIP in DG and DA, highlighting the necessity for this review. This survey presents a comprehensive review of CLIP's applications in DG and DA. In DG, we categorize methods into optimizing prompt learning for task alignment and leveraging CLIP as a backbone for effective feature extraction, both enhancing model adaptability. For DA, we examine both source-available methods utilizing labeled source data and source-free approaches primarily based on target domain data, emphasizing knowledge transfer mechanisms and strategies for improved performance across diverse contexts. Key challenges, including overfitting, domain diversity, and computational efficiency, are addressed, alongside future research opportunities to advance robustness and efficiency in practical applications. By synthesizing existing literature and pinpointing critical gaps, this survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, proposing directions for effectively leveraging CLIP to enhance methodologies in domain generalization and adaptation. Ultimately, this work aims to foster innovation and collaboration in the quest for more resilient machine learning models that can perform reliably across diverse real-world scenarios.

Firstly, the YOLOv7 network structure was lightweight reconstructed, and a three-scale lightweight network architecture was designed. Then, the ELAN-W module of the model neck network is replaced by VoV-GSCSP to reduce the computational cost and the complexity of the network structure. Secondly, a parameter-free attention mechanism was introduced into the neck network to enhance the relevance of local con-text information. Finally, the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) was used to optimize the commonly used IoU index to enhance the localization and detection accuracy of small targets. Experimental results show that compared with YOLOv7 and the current mainstream algorithms, ISTD-YOLO can effectively improve the detection effect, and all indicators are effectively improved, which can achieve high-quality detection of infrared small targets.

Summary:<br />
Ensuring safety in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a challenge. SC-DPO integrates safety constraints into human preference calibration, maximizing human-preferred samples while minimizing safety costs. A safety cost model quantifies harmful levels and is trained using contrastive learning and cost anchoring objectives. The SCP-10K dataset contains harmful concepts for effective training. Dynamic Focusing Mechanism (DFM) helps the model learn difficult preference pair samples.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of generated content remains a fundamental challenge for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Existing studies either fail to guarantee complete safety under potentially harmful concepts or struggle to balance safety with generation quality. To address these issues, we propose Safety-Constrained Direct Preference Optimization (SC-DPO), a novel framework for safety alignment in T2I models. SC-DPO integrates safety constraints into the general human preference calibration, aiming to maximize the likelihood of generating human-preferred samples while minimizing the safety cost of the generated outputs. In SC-DPO, we introduce a safety cost model to accurately quantify harmful levels for images, and train it effectively using the proposed contrastive learning and cost anchoring objectives. To apply SC-DPO for effective T2I safety alignment, we constructed SCP-10K, a safety-constrained preference dataset containing rich harmful concepts, which blends safety-constrained preference pairs under both harmful and clean instructions, further mitigating the trade-off between safety and sample quality. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Focusing Mechanism (DFM) for SC-DPO, promoting the model's learning of difficult preference pair samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-DPO outperforms existing methods, effectively defending against various NSFW content while maintaining optimal sample quality and human preference alignment. Additionally, SC-DPO exhibits resilience against adversarial prompts designed to generate harmful content.

Summary: The article introduces ConFill, a novel framework for image completion that addresses challenges faced by diffusion models. ConFill incorporates a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure alignment between known and unknown image regions during the diffusion process, leading to seamless integration. By reducing discrepancies at each step, the model achieves contextually aligned completion. Additionally, ConFill utilizes a Dynamic Sampling mechanism to adjust the sampling rate based on reconstruction complexity, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill surpasses existing methods, establishing a new benchmark in image completion. <div>
arXiv:2504.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image completion is a challenging task, particularly when ensuring that generated content seamlessly integrates with existing parts of an image. While recent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with maintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue arises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the diffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with the original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global learned distributions rather than localized features, leading to inconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work, we propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and unknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By incorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between generated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually aligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism that adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction complexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill outperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.

Abstract: The rapid development of video surveillance systems for object detection, tracking, activity recognition, and anomaly detection has revolutionized our day-to-day lives while setting alarms for privacy concerns. It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.

<div> Framework, Change Detection, Geo-registration, Self-supervision, Image processing

Summary:
MatchCD is a novel change detection framework that addresses the challenge of fine-grained registration in earth observation systems. The framework utilizes self-supervised contrastive representation to optimize the encoder, enabling seamless integration of image registration and change detection tasks. Unlike traditional methods, MatchCD can process large-scale images directly without the need for patch segmentation. By leveraging zero-shot capabilities, the framework effectively handles bi-temporal unalignment and object change issues, making it suitable for complex scenarios with significant geometric distortion. Overall, MatchCD demonstrates promising performance in various real-world environments, showcasing its potential for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of change detection workflows in earth observation systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential procedure in earth observation system, change detection (CD) aims to reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of the observation regions. A key prerequisite for existing change detection algorithms is aligned geo-references between multi-temporal images by fine-grained registration. However, in the majority of real-world scenarios, a prior manual registration is required between the original images, which significantly increases the complexity of the CD workflow. In this paper, we proposed a self-supervision motivated CD framework with geometric estimation, called "MatchCD". Specifically, the proposed MatchCD framework utilizes the zero-shot capability to optimize the encoder with self-supervised contrastive representation, which is reused in the downstream image registration and change detection to simultaneously handle the bi-temporal unalignment and object change issues. Moreover, unlike the conventional change detection requiring segmenting the full-frame image into small patches, our MatchCD framework can directly process the original large-scale image (e.g., 6K*4K resolutions) with promising performance. The performance in multiple complex scenarios with significant geometric distortion demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

<div> Siamese network tracker, thermal infrared images, fine-grained features, global features, feature fusion<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
A novel saliency-guided Siamese network tracker is proposed to improve tracking accuracy in thermal infrared images. The tracker utilizes fine-grained feature extraction with a dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes to capture essential global features. A multi-layer fine-grained feature fusion module is introduced to integrate features from deep and shallow layers effectively. A Siamese residual refinement block corrects saliency map prediction errors using residual learning, ensuring consistent improvements in accuracy. A saliency loss function is implemented to focus the network on highly discriminative fine-grained features. Experimental results show that the proposed tracker achieves the highest precision and success rates on various benchmarks, including PTB-TIR, LSOTB-TIR, VOT-TIR 2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. <div>
arXiv:2504.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images typically lack detailed features and have low contrast, making it challenging for conventional feature extraction models to capture discriminative target characteristics. As a result, trackers are often affected by interference from visually similar objects and are susceptible to tracking drift. To address these challenges, we propose a novel saliency-guided Siamese network tracker based on key fine-grained feature infor-mation. First, we introduce a fine-grained feature parallel learning convolu-tional block with a dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes. This design captures essential global features from shallow layers, enhances feature diversity, and minimizes the loss of fine-grained in-formation typically encountered in residual connections. In addition, we propose a multi-layer fine-grained feature fusion module that uses bilinear matrix multiplication to effectively integrate features across both deep and shallow layers. Next, we introduce a Siamese residual refinement block that corrects saliency map prediction errors using residual learning. Combined with deep supervision, this mechanism progressively refines predictions, ap-plying supervision at each recursive step to ensure consistent improvements in accuracy. Finally, we present a saliency loss function to constrain the sali-ency predictions, directing the network to focus on highly discriminative fi-ne-grained features. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the pro-posed tracker achieves the highest precision and success rates on the PTB-TIR and LSOTB-TIR benchmarks. It also achieves a top accuracy of 0.78 on the VOT-TIR 2015 benchmark and 0.75 on the VOT-TIR 2017 benchmark.

Abstract: To address the challenge of capturing highly discriminative features in ther-mal infrared (TIR) tracking, we propose a novel Siamese tracker based on cross-channel fine-grained feature learning and progressive fusion. First, we introduce a cross-channel fine-grained feature learning network that employs masks and suppression coefficients to suppress dominant target features, en-abling the tracker to capture more detailed and subtle information. The net-work employs a channel rearrangement mechanism to enhance efficient in-formation flow, coupled with channel equalization to reduce parameter count. Additionally, we incorporate layer-by-layer combination units for ef-fective feature extraction and fusion, thereby minimizing parameter redun-dancy and computational complexity. The network further employs feature redirection and channel shuffling strategies to better integrate fine-grained details. Second, we propose a specialized cross-channel fine-grained loss function designed to guide feature groups toward distinct discriminative re-gions of the target, thus improving overall target representation. This loss function includes an inter-channel loss term that promotes orthogonality be-tween channels, maximizing feature diversity and facilitating finer detail capture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed tracker achieves the highest accuracy, scoring 0.81 on the VOT-TIR 2015 and 0.78 on the VOT-TIR 2017 benchmark, while also outperforming other methods across all evaluation metrics on the LSOTB-TIR and PTB-TIR benchmarks.

Summary:
Our method introduces a one-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) approach that eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by utilizing visual prompting. This allows user edits on the first frame of a video to be propagated to all subsequent frames without compromising content consistency. We propose content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure consistency between edited frames and source frames, inspired by multi-step consistency models. Additionally, we introduce temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across edited frames. Our approach overcomes errors accumulated in DDIM inversion, leading to more accurate reconstruction of source frames and improved content consistency in edited frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality, controllable video editing results. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) is an important yet challenging task, aiming to propagate user edits that are made -- using any image editing tool -- on the first frame of a video to all subsequent frames, while ensuring content consistency between edited frames and source frames. To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary: <br />
This study evaluates different machine learning and deep learning algorithms for tree species classification using multispectral airborne laser scanning data in Southern Finland. The research shows that point-based deep learning methods, especially a point transformer model, outperformed traditional machine learning and image-based deep learning approaches on high-density point clouds. The point transformer model achieved the highest accuracy of 87.9% with 5000 training segments. The image-based deep learning method, DetailView, reached an accuracy of 84.3%, while a random forest classifier achieved 83.2% accuracy. The study also highlights the importance of spectral information, showing a significant increase in classification accuracy with the inclusion of three spectral channels in the point transformer model on the HeliALS data. These findings have implications for improving forest resource management and conservation efforts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Climate-smart and biodiversity-preserving forestry demands precise information on forest resources, extending to the individual tree level. Multispectral airborne laser scanning (ALS) has shown promise in automated point cloud processing and tree segmentation, but challenges remain in identifying rare tree species and leveraging deep learning techniques. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of machine learning and deep learning methods for tree species classification. For the study, we collected high-density multispectral ALS data (>1000 pts/m$^2$) at three wavelengths using the FGI-developed HeliALS system, complemented by existing Optech Titan data (35 pts/m$^2$), to evaluate the species classification accuracy of various algorithms in a test site located in Southern Finland. Based on 5261 test segments, our findings demonstrate that point-based deep learning methods, particularly a point transformer model, outperformed traditional machine learning and image-based deep learning approaches on high-density multispectral point clouds. For the high-density ALS dataset, a point transformer model provided the best performance reaching an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 87.9% (74.5%) with a training set of 1065 segments and 92.0% (85.1%) with 5000 training segments. The best image-based deep learning method, DetailView, reached an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 84.3% (63.9%), whereas a random forest (RF) classifier achieved an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 83.2% (61.3%). Importantly, the overall classification accuracy of the point transformer model on the HeliALS data increased from 73.0% with no spectral information to 84.7% with single-channel reflectance, and to 87.9% with spectral information of all the three channels.

Summary: This article introduces a new security vulnerability in multimodal agents called cross-modal prompt injection attacks. The CrossInject attack framework exploits this vulnerability by embedding adversarial perturbations in multiple modalities to execute unauthorized tasks based on malicious instructions. The approach includes optimizing adversarial features in the visual embedding space and generating malicious textual commands to steer the agent's output towards compliance with attacker's requests. Experimental results show that the method outperforms existing injection attacks and achieves a significant increase in attack success rates.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

Summary:
Multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face challenges due to a perceptual bias stemming from data primarily collected from English speakers. This study proposes a data-efficient approach to enhance VLMs' understanding of perceptual diversity by implementing a multimodal recaptioning strategy based on Language-Label Model (LLM). By modifying object descriptions in English captions before translation, the model achieves significant improvements in text-image retrieval for German and Japanese languages. Through native speaker guidance, the model generates rewrites as training augmentations, leading to enhanced performance (+3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). The study also introduces a mechanism for analyzing object description differences across datasets, offering insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Multilingual VLMs face challenges due to a perceptual bias from data skewed towards English speakers.
- A data-efficient framework enhances VLMs' understanding of perceptual diversity through a multimodal recaptioning strategy guided by LLM.
- Object description modifications in English captions before translation lead to significant improvements in text-image retrieval for German and Japanese.
- By leveraging native speaker input, the model generates rewrites as training augmentations, improving performance metrics.
- An analysis mechanism highlights object description variations across datasets and aids in cross-dataset and cross-language generalization. <div>

Abstract: There are many ways to describe, name, and group objects when captioning an image. Differences are evident when speakers come from diverse cultures due to the unique experiences that shape perception. Machine translation of captions has pushed multilingual capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), but data comes mainly from English speakers, indicating a perceptual bias and lack of model flexibility. In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases). We further propose a mechanism to analyze the specific object description differences across datasets, and we offer insights into cross-dataset and cross-language generalization.

Summary:
Spiking Point Mamba (SPM) is introduced as the first 3D Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based on Mamba technology. SPM utilizes Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE) to enhance temporal interactions and introduces Spiking Mamba Block (SMB) to improve feature learning and reduce information loss from spikes. An asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture is employed for pre-training and fine-tuning. SPM outperforms previous SNN models on various tasks like ScanObjectNN and ShapeNetPart, achieving higher overall accuracy and instance mean Intersection over Union (mIOU). Additionally, SPM is significantly more energy-efficient than its artificial neural network (ANN) counterpart, with at least 3.5 times lower energy consumption. The code for SPM will be publicly available.

Abstract: Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing 3D SNNs have struggled with long-range dependencies until the recent emergence of Mamba, which offers superior computational efficiency and sequence modeling capability. In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs. Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art SNN models, SPM improves OA by +6.2%, +6.1%, and +7.4% on three variants of ScanObjectNN, and boosts instance mIOU by +1.9% on ShapeNetPart. Meanwhile, its energy consumption is at least 3.5x lower than that of its ANN counterpart. The code will be made publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Positional embeddings, Vision Transformers, Patch ordering, Three Cell Experiment, Spatial representation <br />
<br />
Summary: Positional embeddings are essential in Vision Transformers for preserving spatial information. The proposed LOOPE method optimizes patch ordering to improve spatial representation based on a given set of frequencies. Empirical results demonstrate enhanced classification accuracy across various ViT architectures with LOOPE. The "Three Cell Experiment" benchmark evaluates the ability of positional embeddings to retain relative and absolute positional information across different models, revealing a significant performance difference. Standard evaluations typically show a 4 to 6% gap between models with and without positional embeddings, but the Three Cell Experiment exposes a 30 to 35% variation, providing a more sensitive measure of PE efficacy. Experimental analysis confirms that LOOPE effectively retains both relative and absolute positional information, highlighting its superior effectiveness in spatial representation optimization. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional embeddings (PE) play a crucial role in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by providing spatial information otherwise lost due to the permutation invariant nature of self attention. While absolute positional embeddings (APE) have shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE), particularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial inductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental challenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have mostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional embeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering method that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies, providing a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results show that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various ViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional embeddings, we introduce the "Three Cell Experiment", a novel benchmarking framework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute positional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard evaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models with and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference, offering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs. Our experimental analysis confirms that the proposed LOOPE demonstrates enhanced effectiveness in retaining both relative and absolute positional information.

Abstract: Publicly available biomedical videos, such as those on YouTube, serve as valuable educational resources for medical students. Unlike standard machine learning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing medical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing. In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on image tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their respective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video evaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks, MIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves gains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%, respectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform biomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than those seen during training. These results suggest that educational videos created for human learning offer a surprisingly effective training signal for biomedical VLMs.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, adversarial robustness, hallucination mitigation, Hydra framework, factual accuracy

Summary:
Hydra is introduced as an adaptive framework for enhancing plug-in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by addressing adversarial robustness and hallucination mitigation. The framework employs an Action-Critique Loop, utilizing Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning techniques to dynamically refine outputs based on structured critiques and cross-model verification. Unlike existing methods that focus on either defense against adversarial attacks or post-hoc correction for hallucination errors, Hydra bridges both aspects to improve resilience to adversarial perturbations and intrinsic model errors. Evaluation on four VLMs, three hallucination benchmarks, and various attack and defense strategies demonstrates Hydra's superiority in surpassing plug-in models and state-of-the-art dehallucination methods. By providing a scalable, training-free solution, Hydra effectively enhances the reliability of VLMs in high-stakes applications such as defense and healthcare.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: To develop trustworthy Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it is essential to address adversarial robustness and hallucination mitigation, both of which impact factual accuracy in high-stakes applications such as defense and healthcare. Existing methods primarily focus on either adversarial defense or hallucination post-hoc correction, leaving a gap in unified robustness strategies. We introduce \textbf{Hydra}, an adaptive agentic framework that enhances plug-in VLMs through iterative reasoning, structured critiques, and cross-model verification, improving both resilience to adversarial perturbations and intrinsic model errors. Hydra employs an Action-Critique Loop, where it retrieves and critiques visual information, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques to refine outputs dynamically. Unlike static post-hoc correction methods, Hydra adapts to both adversarial manipulations and intrinsic model errors, making it robust to malicious perturbations and hallucination-related inaccuracies. We evaluate Hydra on four VLMs, three hallucination benchmarks, two adversarial attack strategies, and two adversarial defense methods, assessing performance on both clean and adversarial inputs. Results show that Hydra surpasses plug-in VLMs and state-of-the-art (SOTA) dehallucination methods, even without explicit adversarial defenses, demonstrating enhanced robustness and factual consistency. By bridging adversarial resistance and hallucination mitigation, Hydra provides a scalable, training-free solution for improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: The increasing demand for AR/VR applications has highlighted the need for high-quality 360-degree panoramic content. However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications. The code is available here. https://github.com/pmh9960/SphereDiff

<title>Adversarial Attack for RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14423</link>

Abstract: Visual object tracking is a crucial research topic in the fields of computer vision and multi-modal fusion. Among various approaches, robust visual tracking that combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention from researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking, it is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks and defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area remains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because of the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels and frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two representations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel, we first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame adversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a two-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the target region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a gradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event voxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal universal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal data. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used RGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces the performance of the tracker across numerous datasets in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Adversarial_Attack_Defense

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but they suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet factually incorrect content. This issue extends to Video-Language Models (VideoLLMs), where textual descriptions may inaccurately represent visual content, resulting in multi-modal hallucinations. In this paper, we address hallucination in ResNetVLLM, a video-language model combining ResNet visual encoders with LLMs. We introduce a two-step protocol: (1) a faithfulness detection strategy that uses a modified Lynx model to assess semantic alignment between generated captions and ground-truth video references, and (2) a hallucination mitigation strategy using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an ad-hoc knowledge base dynamically constructed during inference. Our enhanced model, ResNetVLLM-2, reduces multi-modal hallucinations by cross-verifying generated content against external knowledge, improving factual consistency. Evaluation on the ActivityNet-QA benchmark demonstrates a substantial accuracy increase from 54.8% to 65.3%, highlighting the effectiveness of our hallucination detection and mitigation strategies in enhancing video-language model reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ResNetVLLM (ResNet Vision LLM), a novel cross-modal framework for zero-shot video understanding that integrates a ResNet-based visual encoder with a Large Language Model (LLM. ResNetVLLM addresses the challenges associated with zero-shot video models by avoiding reliance on pre-trained video understanding models and instead employing a non-pretrained ResNet to extract visual features. This design ensures the model learns visual and semantic representations within a unified architecture, enhancing its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions from video inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that ResNetVLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot video understanding (ZSVU) on several benchmarks, including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, TGIF-QA FrameQA, and ActivityNet-QA.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) shows promise in reducing reliance on scarce labeled medical data. However, SSMIS field confronts challenges such as distribution mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data, artificial perturbations causing training biases, and inadequate use of raw image information, especially low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components.To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Transform based Bidirectional Copy-Paste SSMIS framework, named WT-BCP, which improves upon the Mean Teacher approach. Our method enhances unlabeled data understanding by copying random crops between labeled and unlabeled images and employs WT to extract LF and HF details.We propose a multi-input and multi-output model named XNet-Plus, to receive the fused information after WT. Moreover, consistency training among multiple outputs helps to mitigate learning biases introduced by artificial perturbations. During consistency training, the mixed images resulting from WT are fed into both models, with the student model's output being supervised by pseudo-labels and ground-truth. Extensive experiments conducted on 2D and 3D datasets confirm the effectiveness of our model.Code: https://github.com/simzhangbest/WT-BCP.

Abstract: Including children's images in datasets has raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, consent, data protection, and accountability. These datasets, often built by scraping publicly available images from the Internet, can expose children to risks such as exploitation, profiling, and tracking. Despite the growing recognition of these issues, approaches for addressing them remain limited. We explore the ethical implications of using children's images in AI datasets and propose a pipeline to detect and remove such images. As a use case, we built the pipeline on a Vision-Language Model under the Visual Question Answering task and tested it on the #PraCegoVer dataset. We also evaluate the pipeline on a subset of 100,000 images from the Open Images V7 dataset to assess its effectiveness in detecting and removing images of children. The pipeline serves as a baseline for future research, providing a starting point for more comprehensive tools and methodologies. While we leverage existing models trained on potentially problematic data, our goal is to expose and address this issue. We do not advocate for training or deploying such models, but instead call for urgent community reflection and action to protect children's rights. Ultimately, we aim to encourage the research community to exercise - more than an additional - care in creating new datasets and to inspire the development of tools to protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable groups, particularly children.

Abstract: Counterfactual medical image generation effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances the interpretability of medical images. However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced novel view synthesis by utilizing Gaussians to represent scenes. Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.

<title>LGD: Leveraging Generative Descriptions for Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot referring image segmentation aims to locate and segment the target region based on a referring expression, with the primary challenge of aligning and matching semantics across visual and textual modalities without training. Previous works address this challenge by utilizing Vision-Language Models and mask proposal networks for region-text matching. However, this paradigm may lead to incorrect target localization due to the inherent ambiguity and diversity of free-form referring expressions. To alleviate this issue, we present LGD (Leveraging Generative Descriptions), a framework that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models to enhance region-text matching performance in Vision-Language Models. Specifically, we first design two kinds of prompts, the attribute prompt and the surrounding prompt, to guide the Multi-Modal Large Language Models in generating descriptions related to the crucial attributes of the referent object and the details of surrounding objects, referred to as attribute description and surrounding description, respectively. Secondly, three visual-text matching scores are introduced to evaluate the similarity between instance-level visual features and textual features, which determines the mask most associated with the referring expression. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, with maximum improvements of 9.97% in oIoU and 11.29% in mIoU compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Demand for 2K video synthesis is rising with increasing consumer expectations for ultra-clear visuals. While diffusion transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-quality video generation, scaling them to 2K resolution remains computationally prohibitive due to quadratic growth in memory and processing costs. In this work, we propose Turbo2K, an efficient and practical framework for generating detail-rich 2K videos while significantly improving training and inference efficiency. First, Turbo2K operates in a highly compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity and memory footprint, making high-resolution video synthesis feasible. However, the high compression ratio of the VAE and limited model size impose constraints on generative quality. To mitigate this, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that enables a smaller student model to inherit the generative capacity of a larger, more powerful teacher model. Our analysis reveals that, despite differences in latent spaces and architectures, DiTs exhibit structural similarities in their internal representations, facilitating effective knowledge transfer. Second, we design a hierarchical two-stage synthesis framework that first generates multi-level feature at lower resolutions before guiding high-resolution video generation. This approach ensures structural coherence and fine-grained detail refinement while eliminating redundant encoding-decoding overhead, further enhancing computational efficiency.Turbo2K achieves state-of-the-art efficiency, generating 5-second, 24fps, 2K videos with significantly reduced computational cost. Compared to existing methods, Turbo2K is up to 20$\times$ faster for inference, making high-resolution video generation more scalable and practical for real-world applications.

arXiv:2504.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), also known as neural fields, have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, parameterizing continuous spatial fields using coordinate-based neural networks. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PICO}, an INR-based framework for static point cloud compression. Unlike prevailing encoder-decoder paradigms, we decompose the point cloud compression task into two separate stages: geometry compression and attribute compression, each with distinct INR optimization objectives. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce a novel network architecture, \textbf{LeAFNet}, which leverages learnable activation functions in the latent space to better approximate the target signal's implicit function. By reformulating point cloud compression as neural parameter compression, we further improve compression efficiency through quantization and entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{LeAFNet} outperforms conventional MLPs in INR-based point cloud compression. Furthermore, \textbf{PICO} achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the current MPEG point cloud compression standard, yielding an average improvement of $4.92$ dB in D1 PSNR. In joint geometry and attribute compression, our approach exhibits highly competitive results, with an average PCQM gain of $2.7 \times 10^{-3}$.

<title>Vision-Centric Representation-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Robust Universal Foreground Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foreground segmentation is crucial for scene understanding, yet parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision foundation models (VFMs) often fails in complex scenarios, such as camouflage and infrared imagery. We attribute this challenge to the inherent texture bias in VFMs, which is exacerbated during fine-tuning and limits generalization in texture-sparse environments. To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-bias Representation Side-tuning (LSR-ST), a lightweight PEFT framework that enhances model robustness by introducing shape-biased inductive priors. LSR-ST captures shape-aware features using a simple HDConv Block, which integrates large-kernel attention and residual learning. The method satisfies three key conditions for inducing shape bias: large receptive fields, multi-order feature interactions, and sparse connectivity. Our analysis reveals that these improvements stem from representation efficiency-the ability to extract task-relevant, structurally grounded features while minimizing redundancy. We formalize this concept via Information Bottleneck theory and advocate for it as a key PEFT objective. Unlike traditional NLP paradigms that focus on optimizing parameters and memory, visual tasks require models that extract task-defined semantics, rather than just relying on pre-encoded features. This shift enables our approach to move beyond conventional trade-offs, offering more robust and generalizable solutions for vision tasks. With minimal changes to SAM2-UNet, LSR-ST achieves consistent improvements across 17 datasets and 6 tasks using only 4.719M trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of representation efficiency for robust and adaptable VFMs within complex visual environments.

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) target tracking methods often adopt the correlation filter (CF) framework due to its computational efficiency. However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DreamID, a diffusion-based face swapping model that achieves high levels of ID similarity, attribute preservation, image fidelity, and fast inference speed. Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity. Overall, DreamID achieves high-quality face swapping results at 512*512 resolution in just 0.6 seconds and performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting, large angles, and occlusions.

<title>Back on Track: Bundle Adjustment for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14516</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional SLAM systems, which rely on bundle adjustment, struggle with highly dynamic scenes commonly found in casual videos. Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic elements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM -- bundle adjustment -- with a robust learning-based 3D tracker front-end. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks the camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements. Our experiments on challenging datasets reveal significant improvements in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction accuracy.

<title>Are Vision LLMs Road-Ready? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Safety-Critical Driving Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general visual tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, their effectiveness in specialized, safety-critical domains like autonomous driving remains largely unexplored. Autonomous driving systems require sophisticated scene understanding in complex environments, yet existing multimodal benchmarks primarily focus on normal driving conditions, failing to adequately assess VLLMs' performance in safety-critical scenarios. To address this, we introduce DVBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of VLLMs in understanding safety-critical driving videos. Built around a hierarchical ability taxonomy that aligns with widely adopted frameworks for describing driving scenarios used in assessing highly automated driving systems, DVBench features 10,000 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated ground-truth answers, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of VLLMs' capabilities in perception and reasoning. Experiments on 14 SOTA VLLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters, reveal significant performance gaps, with no model achieving over 40% accuracy, highlighting critical limitations in understanding complex driving scenarios. To probe adaptability, we fine-tuned selected models using domain-specific data from DVBench, achieving accuracy gains ranging from 5.24 to 10.94 percentage points, with relative improvements of up to 43.59%. This improvement underscores the necessity of targeted adaptation to bridge the gap between general-purpose VLLMs and mission-critical driving applications. DVBench establishes an essential evaluation framework and research roadmap for developing VLLMs that meet the safety and robustness requirements for real-world autonomous systems. We released the benchmark toolbox and the fine-tuned model at: https://github.com/tong-zeng/DVBench.git.

<title>SUDO: Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Self-Supervised Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Previous text-to-image diffusion models typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance pre-trained base models. However, this approach primarily minimizes the loss of mean squared error (MSE) at the pixel level, neglecting the need for global optimization at the image level, which is crucial for achieving high perceptual quality and structural coherence. In this paper, we introduce Self-sUpervised Direct preference Optimization (SUDO), a novel paradigm that optimizes both fine-grained details at the pixel level and global image quality. By integrating direct preference optimization into the model, SUDO generates preference image pairs in a self-supervised manner, enabling the model to prioritize global-level learning while complementing the pixel-level MSE loss. As an effective alternative to supervised fine-tuning, SUDO can be seamlessly applied to any text-to-image diffusion model. Importantly, it eliminates the need for costly data collection and annotation efforts typically associated with traditional direct preference optimization methods. Through extensive experiments on widely-used models, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL, we demonstrate that SUDO significantly enhances both global and local image quality.

arXiv:2504.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) can generate high-quality videos, but often struggle with producing temporally coherent motion. Optical flow supervision is a promising approach to address this, with prior works commonly employing warping-based strategies that avoid explicit flow matching. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation, FlowLoss, which directly compares flow fields extracted from generated and ground-truth videos. To account for the unreliability of flow estimation under high-noise conditions in diffusion, we propose a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates the flow loss across denoising steps. Experiments on robotic video datasets suggest that FlowLoss improves motion stability and accelerates convergence in early training stages. Our findings offer practical insights for incorporating motion-based supervision into noise-conditioned generative models.

<title>VGNC: Reducing the Overfitting of Sparse-view 3DGS via Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is a fundamental yet challenging task in practical 3D reconstruction applications. Recently, many methods based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.

Abstract: Temporal Action Detection and Moment Retrieval constitute two pivotal tasks in video understanding, focusing on precisely localizing temporal segments corresponding to specific actions or events. Recent advancements introduced Moment Detection to unify these two tasks, yet existing approaches remain confined to closed-set scenarios, limiting their applicability in open-world contexts. To bridge this gap, we present Grounding-MD, an innovative, grounded video-language pre-training framework tailored for open-world moment detection. Our framework incorporates an arbitrary number of open-ended natural language queries through a structured prompt mechanism, enabling flexible and scalable moment detection. Grounding-MD leverages a Cross-Modality Fusion Encoder and a Text-Guided Fusion Decoder to facilitate comprehensive video-text alignment and enable effective cross-task collaboration. Through large-scale pre-training on temporal action detection and moment retrieval datasets, Grounding-MD demonstrates exceptional semantic representation learning capabilities, effectively handling diverse and complex query conditions. Comprehensive evaluations across four benchmark datasets including ActivityNet, THUMOS14, ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA demonstrate that Grounding-MD establishes new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and supervised settings in open-world moment detection scenarios. All source code and trained models will be released.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal infrared target tracking is crucial in applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and military operations. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker, SMTT, which effectively addresses common challenges in thermal infrared imagery, such as noise, occlusion, and rapid target motion, by leveraging multi-task learning, joint sparse representation, and adaptive graph regularization. By reformulating the tracking task as a multi-task learning problem, the SMTT tracker independently optimizes the representation of each particle while dynamically capturing spatial and feature-level similarities using a weighted mixed-norm regularization strategy. To ensure real-time performance, we incorporate the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets - including VOT-TIR, PTB-TIR, and LSOTB-TIR - demonstrate that SMTT achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results highlight SMTT as a reliable and high-performance solution for thermal infrared target tracking in complex environments.

<title>Using street view imagery and deep generative modeling for estimating the health of urban forests</title>

Abstract: Healthy urban forests comprising of diverse trees and shrubs play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. They provide several key advantages such as providing shade for energy conservation, and intercepting rainfall to reduce flood runoff and soil erosion. Traditional approaches for monitoring the health of urban forests require instrumented inspection techniques, often involving a high amount of human labor and subjective evaluations. As a result, they are not scalable for cities which lack extensive resources. Recent approaches involving multi-spectral imaging data based on terrestrial sensing and satellites, are constrained respectively with challenges related to dedicated deployments and limited spatial resolutions. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for monitoring the urban forests using simplified inputs: street view imagery, tree inventory data and meteorological conditions. We propose to use image-to-image translation networks to estimate two urban forest health parameters, namely, NDVI and CTD. Finally, we aim to compare the generated results with ground truth data using an onsite campaign utilizing handheld multi-spectral and thermal imaging sensors. With the advent and expansion of street view imagery platforms such as Google Street View and Mapillary, this approach should enable effective management of urban forests for the authorities in cities at scale.

<title>MP-Mat: A 3D-and-Instance-Aware Human Matting and Editing Framework with Multiplane Representation</title>

Abstract: Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human instance in an image, which is challenging as it easily fails in complex cases requiring disentangling mingled pixels belonging to multiple instances along hairy and thin boundary structures. In this work, we address this by introducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with multiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two different perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically, we first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into multiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene representation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting instances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and boundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce another multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level perspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also treat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing methods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and background content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like image editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize controllable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive experiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task. We also demonstrate its superiority in image editing tasks, an area under-explored by existing matting-focused methods, where our approach under zero-shot inference even outperforms trained specialized image editing techniques by large margins. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/JiaoSiyi/MPMat.git}.

Abstract: Understanding bimanual hand interactions is essential for realistic 3D pose and shape reconstruction. However, existing methods struggle with occlusions, ambiguous appearances, and computational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose Vision Mamba Bimanual Hand Interaction Network (VM-BHINet), introducing state space models (SSMs) into hand reconstruction to enhance interaction modeling while improving computational efficiency. The core component, Vision Mamba Interaction Feature Extraction Block (VM-IFEBlock), combines SSMs with local and global feature operations, enabling deep understanding of hand interactions. Experiments on the InterHand2.6M dataset show that VM-BHINet reduces Mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) and Mean per-vertex position error (MPVPE) by 2-3%, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Wireless signal-based human sensing technologies, such as WiFi, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), enable the detection and interpretation of human presence, posture, and activities, thereby providing critical support for applications in public security, healthcare, and smart environments. These technologies exhibit notable advantages due to their non-contact operation and environmental adaptability; however, existing systems often fail to leverage the textual information inherent in datasets. To address this, we propose an innovative text-enhanced wireless sensing framework, WiTalk, that seamlessly integrates semantic knowledge through three hierarchical prompt strategies-label-only, brief description, and detailed action description-without requiring architectural modifications or incurring additional data costs. We rigorously validate this framework across three public benchmark datasets: XRF55 for human action recognition (HAR), and WiFiTAL and XRFV2 for WiFi temporal action localization (TAL). Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements: on XRF55, accuracy for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave increases by 3.9%, 2.59%, and 0.46%, respectively; on WiFiTAL, the average performance of WiFiTAD improves by 4.98%; and on XRFV2, the mean average precision gains across various methods range from 4.02% to 13.68%.

Abstract: Lung cancer, a severe form of malignant tumor that originates in the tissues of the lungs, can be fatal if not detected in its early stages. It ranks among the top causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detecting lung cancer manually using chest X-Ray image or Computational Tomography (CT) scans image poses significant challenges for radiologists. Hence, there is a need for automatic diagnosis system of lung cancers from radiology images. With the recent emergence of deep learning, particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the automated detection of lung cancer has become a much simpler task. Nevertheless, numerous researchers have addressed that the performance of conventional CNNs may be hindered due to class imbalance issue, which is prevalent in medical images. In this research work, we have proposed a novel CNN architecture ``Multi-Scale Dense Network (MSD-Net)'' (trained-from-scratch). The novelties we bring in the proposed model are (I) We introduce novel dense modules in the 4th block and 5th block of the CNN model. We have leveraged 3 depthwise separable convolutional (DWSC) layers, and one 1x1 convolutional layer in each dense module, in order to reduce complexity of the model considerably. (II) Additionally, we have incorporated one skip connection from 3rd block to 5th block and one parallel branch connection from 4th block to Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer. We have utilized dilated convolutional layer (with dilation rate=2) in the last parallel branch in order to extract multi-scale features. Extensive experiments reveal that our proposed model has outperformed latest CNN model ConvNext-Tiny, recent trend Vision Transformer (ViT), Pooling-based ViT (PiT), and other existing models by significant margins.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities in image-level visual perception tasks. However, they fall short in 3D instance-level segmentation tasks that require accurate localization and recognition of individual objects.

Our method simulates realistic 3D perspectives, effectively augmenting existing hard visual prompts by enforcing geometric consistency across viewpoints. This training-free strategy seamlessly integrates with prior hard visual prompts, enriching object-descriptive features and enabling VLMs to achieve more robust and accurate 3D instance segmentation in diverse 3D scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved object-level grounding and region captioning, but remain limited in visual relation understanding (\eg, scene graph generation), particularly in modeling \textit{N}-ary relationships that identify multiple semantic roles among an action event. Such a lack of \textit{semantic dependencies} modeling among multi-entities leads to unreliable outputs, intensifying MLLMs' hallucinations and over-reliance on language priors. To this end, we propose Relation-R1, the first unified relational comprehension framework that explicitly integrates cognitive chain-of-thought (CoT)-guided Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we first establish foundational reasoning capabilities via SFT, enforcing structured outputs with thinking processes. Then, GRPO is utilized to refine these outputs via multi-reward optimization, prioritizing visual-semantic grounding over language-induced biases, thereby improving generalization capability. Extensive experiments on widely-used PSG and SWiG datasets demonstrate that Relation-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both binary and \textit{N}-ary relation understanding.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in visual art understanding: given an art image, the model pinpoints pixel regions that trigger a specific human emotion, and generates linguistic explanations for the emotional arousal. Despite recent advances in art understanding, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual challenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion makes it difficult for general segmentation models like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second, the abstract nature of art expression makes it difficult for captioning models to balance pixel-level semantic understanding and emotion reasoning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the segmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with the language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain semantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. The method innovatively realizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level emotion interpretation, providing the first interpretable fine-grained analysis framework for artistic emotion computing. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model.

Abstract: While achieving excellent results on various datasets, many deep learning methods for image deblurring suffer from limited generalization capabilities with out-of-domain data. This limitation is likely caused by their dependence on certain domain-specific datasets. To address this challenge, we argue that it is necessary to introduce the kernel prior into deep learning methods, as the kernel prior remains independent of the image context. For effective fusion of kernel prior information, we adopt a rational implementation method inspired by traditional deblurring algorithms that perform deconvolution in the frequency domain. We propose a module called Frequency Integration Module (FIM) for fusing the kernel prior and combine it with a frequency-based deblurring Transfomer network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple blind image deblurring tasks, showcasing robust generalization abilities. Source code will be available soon.

Abstract: Traditional predictive coding networks, inspired by theories of brain function, consistently achieve promising results across various domains, extending their influence into the field of computer vision. However, the performance of the predictive coding networks is limited by their error feedback mechanism, which traditionally employs either local or global recurrent updates, leading to suboptimal performance in processing both local and broader details simultaneously. In addition, traditional predictive coding networks face difficulties in dynamically adjusting to the complexity and context of varying input data, which is crucial for achieving high levels of performance in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, there is a gap in the development and application of specific loss functions that could more effectively guide the model towards optimal performance. To deal with these issues, this paper introduces a hybrid prediction error feedback mechanism with dynamic modulation for deep predictive coding networks by effectively combining global contexts and local details while adjusting feedback based on input complexity. Additionally, we present a loss function tailored to this framework to improve accuracy by focusing on precise prediction error minimization. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over other approaches, showcasing faster convergence and higher predictive accuracy in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and FashionMNIST datasets.

<title>Generative Multimodal Pretraining with Discrete Diffusion Timestep Tokens</title>

Abstract: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify visual comprehension and generation by combining LLM and diffusion models, the state-of-the-art in each task, respectively. Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation from monocular videos remains challenging due to ambiguities inherent in single-view geometry, as crucial depth cues like stereopsis are absent. However, humans often perceive relative depth intuitively by observing variations in the size and spacing of objects as they move. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that infers relative depth by examining the spatial relationships and temporal evolution of a set of tracked 2D trajectories. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf point tracking models to capture 2D trajectories. Then, our approach employs spatial and temporal transformers to process these trajectories and directly infer depth changes over time. Evaluated on the TAPVid-3D benchmark, our method demonstrates robust zero-shot performance, generalizing effectively from synthetic to real-world datasets. Results indicate that our approach achieves temporally smooth, high-accuracy depth predictions across diverse domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language multimodal models (LMMs) for video have demonstrated their potential for understanding video content, yet the task of comprehending multi-discipline lectures remains largely unexplored. We introduce Video-MMLU, a massive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in understanding Multi-Discipline Lectures. We evaluate over 90 open-source and proprietary models, ranging from 0.5B to 40B parameters. Our results highlight the limitations of current models in addressing the cognitive challenges presented by these lectures, especially in tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. Additionally, we explore how the number of visual tokens and the large language models influence performance, offering insights into the interplay between multimodal perception and reasoning in lecture comprehension.

Abstract: Spine surgery is a high-risk intervention demanding precise execution, often supported by image-based navigation systems. Recently, supervised learning approaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from sparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on radiation-intensive 3D imaging systems. However, these methods typically require large amounts of annotated training data and may struggle to generalize across varying patient anatomies or imaging conditions. Instance-learning approaches like Gaussian splatting could offer an alternative by avoiding extensive annotation requirements. While Gaussian splatting has shown promise for novel view synthesis, its application to sparse, arbitrarily posed real intraoperative X-rays has remained largely unexplored. This work addresses this limitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct anatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We introduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing reconstruction quality. Notably, our framework requires no pretraining, making it inherently adaptable to new patients and anatomies. We evaluated our approach using an ex-vivo dataset. Expert surgical evaluation confirmed the clinical utility of the 3D reconstructions for navigation, especially when using 20 to 30 views, and highlighted the standardization's benefit for anatomical clarity. Benchmarking via quantitative 2D metrics (PSNR/SSIM) confirmed performance trade-offs compared to idealized settings, but also validated the improvement gained from standardization over raw inputs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of instance-based volumetric reconstruction from arbitrary sparse-view X-rays, advancing intraoperative 3D imaging for surgical navigation.

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) based hand gesture recognition converts forearm muscle activity into control commands for prosthetics, rehabilitation, and human computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to EMG-based hand gesture recognition that uses fine-grained classification and presents XMANet, which unifies low-level local and high level semantic cues through cross layer mutual attention among shallow to deep CNN experts. Using stacked spectrograms and scalograms derived from the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT), we benchmark XMANet against ResNet50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0. Experimental results on the Grabmyo dataset indicate that, using STFT, the proposed XMANet model outperforms the baseline ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet121 models with improvement of approximately 1.72%, 4.38%, 5.10%, and 2.53%, respectively. When employing the WT approach, improvements of around 1.57%, 1.88%, 1.46%, and 2.05% are observed over the same baselines. Similarly, on the FORS EMG dataset, the XMANet(ResNet50) model using STFT shows an improvement of about 5.04% over the baseline ResNet50. In comparison, the XMANet(DenseNet121) and XMANet(MobileNetV3) models yield enhancements of approximately 4.11% and 2.81%, respectively. Moreover, when using WT, the proposed XMANet achieves gains of around 4.26%, 9.36%, 5.72%, and 6.09% over the baseline ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0 models, respectively. These results confirm that XMANet consistently improves performance across various architectures and signal processing techniques, demonstrating the strong potential of fine grained features for accurate and robust EMG classification.

<title>Exposing the Copycat Problem of Imitation-based Planner: A Novel Closed-Loop Simulator, Causal Benchmark and Joint IL-RL Baseline</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based planners have recently gained significant attention. They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen situations.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative approaches. The code for this work will be released soon.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial for advancing clinical diagnostics and surgical planning, yet remains a complex challenge due to the variability in anatomical structures and the demand for low-complexity models. In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation, where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark for medical image analysis. This work paves the way for developing accessible, high-performance diagnostic tools suitable for clinical environments and resource-constrained settings, making it a step forward in the democratization of advanced medical technology.

arXiv:2504.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in monocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is effectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion estimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over extended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point distributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism. This 3D contextualization strategy effectively exploits spatial relationships in 3D, forming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking methods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D pixel trackers when accurate depth is available. It supports inference in both camera coordinates (i.e., unstabilized) and world coordinates, and our results demonstrate that compensating for camera motion improves tracking performance. Our approach replaces the conventional 2D square correlation neighborhoods used in prior 2D and 3D trackers, leading to more robust and accurate results across various 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: The analysis of plant developmental plasticity, including root system architecture, is fundamental to understanding plant adaptability and development, particularly in the context of climate change and agricultural sustainability. While significant advances have been made in plant phenotyping technologies, comprehensive temporal analysis of root development remains challenging, with most existing solutions providing either limited throughput or restricted structural analysis capabilities. Here, we present ChronoRoot 2.0, an integrated open-source platform that combines affordable hardware with advanced artificial intelligence to enable sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping. The system introduces several major advances, offering an integral perspective of seedling development: (i) simultaneous multi-organ tracking of six distinct plant structures, (ii) quality control through real-time validation, (iii) comprehensive architectural measurements including novel gravitropic response parameters, and (iv) dual specialized user interfaces for both architectural analysis and high-throughput screening. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through three use cases for Arabidopsis thaliana: characterization of circadian growth patterns under different light conditions, detailed analysis of gravitropic responses in transgenic plants, and high-throughput screening of etiolation responses across multiple genotypes. ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains its predecessor's advantages of low cost and modularity while significantly expanding its capabilities, making sophisticated temporal phenotyping more accessible to the broader plant science community. The system's open-source nature, combined with extensive documentation and containerized deployment options, ensures reproducibility and enables community-driven development of new analytical capabilities.

<title>SuperCL: Superpixel Guided Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation Pre-training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining extensive datasets of high-quality, expert-annotated images. Contrastive learning presents a potential but still problematic solution to this issue. Because most existing methods focus on extracting instance-level or pixel-to-pixel representation, which ignores the characteristics between intra-image similar pixel groups. Moreover, when considering contrastive pairs generation, most SOTA methods mainly rely on manually setting thresholds, which requires a large number of gradient experiments and lacks efficiency and generalization. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach named SuperCL for medical image segmentation pre-training. Specifically, our SuperCL exploits the structural prior and pixel correlation of images by introducing two novel contrastive pairs generation strategies: Intra-image Local Contrastive Pairs (ILCP) Generation and Inter-image Global Contrastive Pairs (IGCP) Generation. Considering superpixel cluster aligns well with the concept of contrastive pairs generation, we utilize the superpixel map to generate pseudo masks for both ILCP and IGCP to guide supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, we also propose two modules named Average SuperPixel Feature Map Generation (ASP) and Connected Components Label Generation (CCL) to better exploit the prior structural information for IGCP. Finally, experiments on 8 medical image datasets indicate our SuperCL outperforms existing 12 methods. i.e. Our SuperCL achieves a superior performance with more precise predictions from visualization figures and 3.15%, 5.44%, 7.89% DSC higher than the previous best results on MMWHS, CHAOS, Spleen with 10% annotations. Our code will be released after acceptance.

<title>Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.

<title>How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?</title>

arXiv:2504.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.

Abstract: Cloud occlusion significantly hinders remote sensing applications by obstructing surface information and complicating analysis. To address this, we propose DC4CR (Diffusion Control for Cloud Removal), a novel multimodal diffusion-based framework for cloud removal in remote sensing imagery. Our method introduces prompt-driven control, allowing selective removal of thin and thick clouds without relying on pre-generated cloud masks, thereby enhancing preprocessing efficiency and model adaptability. Additionally, we integrate low-rank adaptation for computational efficiency, subject-driven generation for improved generalization, and grouped learning to enhance performance on small datasets. Designed as a plug-and-play module, DC4CR seamlessly integrates into existing cloud removal models, providing a scalable and robust solution. Extensive experiments on the RICE and CUHK-CR datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior cloud removal across diverse conditions. This work presents a practical and efficient approach for remote sensing image processing with broad real-world applications.

Abstract: A driver face monitoring system can detect driver fatigue, which is a significant factor in many accidents, using computer vision techniques. In this paper, we present a real-time technique for driver eye state detection. First, the face is detected, and the eyes are located within the face region for tracking. A normalized cross-correlation-based online dynamic template matching technique, combined with Kalman filter tracking, is proposed to track the detected eye positions in subsequent image frames. A support vector machine with histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features is used to classify the state of the eyes as open or closed. If the eyes remain closed for a specified period, the driver is considered to be asleep, and an alarm is triggered.

arXiv:2504.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However, ViTs face challenges such as high computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention and the requirement of a large amount of training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Efficient Convolutional Vision Transformer (ECViT), a hybrid architecture that effectively combines the strengths of CNNs and Transformers. ECViT introduces inductive biases such as locality and translation invariance, inherent to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the Transformer framework by extracting patches from low-level features and enhancing the encoder with convolutional operations. Additionally, it incorporates local-attention and a pyramid structure to enable efficient multi-scale feature extraction and representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ECViT achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art models on various image classification tasks while maintaining low computational and storage requirements. ECViT offers an ideal solution for applications that prioritize high efficiency without compromising performance.

<title>Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation for Efficient Image Restoration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential increase in image data, training an image restoration model is laborious. Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).

arXiv:2504.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal data provides abundant and diverse object information, crucial for effective modal interactions in Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and fail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities, particularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the Modality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first construct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local details by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between patches. Subsequently, the selective graph nodes swap operation is employed to alleviate the adverse effects of low-quality local features by considering both local and global information, enhancing the representation of discriminative information. Finally, the swapped modality-aware graphs are fed into the local-aware graph reasoning module, which propagates multi-modal information to yield a reliable feature representation. Another advantage of the proposed graph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal information by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing disparities between different modalities. Experimental results on four benchmarks (RGBNT201, Market1501-MM, RGBNT100, MSVR310) indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object ReID. The code for our method will be available upon acceptance.

arXiv:2504.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in various multimodal tasks but frequently suffer from poor calibration, resulting in misalignment between their verbalized confidence and response correctness. This miscalibration undermines user trust, especially when models confidently provide incorrect or fabricated information. In this work, we propose a novel Confidence Calibration through Semantic Perturbation (CSP) framework to improve the calibration of verbalized confidence for VLMs in response to object-centric queries. We first introduce a perturbed dataset where Gaussian noise is applied to the key object regions to simulate visual uncertainty at different confidence levels, establishing an explicit mapping between visual ambiguity and confidence levels. We further enhance calibration through a two-stage training process combining supervised fine-tuning on the perturbed dataset with subsequent preference optimization. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the alignment between verbalized confidence and response correctness while maintaining or enhancing overall task performance. These results highlight the potential of semantic perturbation as a practical tool for improving the reliability and interpretability of VLMs.

<title>Bridge the Gap: From Weak to Full Supervision for Temporal Action Localization with PseudoFormer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) has achieved notable success but still suffers from a lack of temporal annotations, leading to a performance and framework gap compared with fully-supervised methods. While recent approaches employ pseudo labels for training, three key challenges: generating high-quality pseudo labels, making full use of different priors, and optimizing training methods with noisy labels remain unresolved. Due to these perspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that bridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action Localization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted action proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better quality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels with different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model in the full branch. Finally, the uncertainty mask and iterative refinement mechanism are applied for training with noisy pseudo labels. PseudoFormer achieves state-of-the-art WTAL results on the two commonly used benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Besides, extensive ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component of our method.

Abstract: Modern text-to-image generation systems have enabled the creation of remarkably realistic and high-quality visuals, yet they often falter when handling the inherent ambiguities in user prompts. In this work, we present Twin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to progressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process, Twin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue agent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is generated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized dialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to evolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to progressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by reducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the generated images, streamlining the creative process across various applications.

<title>ReSpec: Relevance and Specificity Grounded Online Filtering for Learning on Video-Text Data Streams</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of video-text data presents challenges in storage and computation during training. Online learning, which processes streaming data in real-time, offers a promising solution to these issues while also allowing swift adaptations in scenarios demanding real-time responsiveness. One strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning involves identifying and prioritizing data that enhances performance on target downstream tasks. We propose Relevance and Specificity-based online filtering framework (ReSpec) that selects data based on four criteria: (i) modality alignment for clean data, (ii) task relevance for target focused data, (iii) specificity for informative and detailed data, and (iv) efficiency for low-latency processing. Relevance is determined by the probabilistic alignment of incoming data with downstream tasks, while specificity employs the distance to a root embedding representing the least specific data as an efficient proxy for informativeness. By establishing reference points from target task data, ReSpec filters incoming data in real-time, eliminating the need for extensive storage and compute. Evaluating on large-scale datasets WebVid2M and VideoCC3M, ReSpec attains state-of-the-art performance on five zeroshot video retrieval tasks, using as little as 5% of the data while incurring minimal compute. The source code is available at https://github.com/cdjkim/ReSpec.

<title>Collaborative Enhancement Network for Low-quality Multi-spectral Vehicle Re-identification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14877</link>

Abstract: The performance of multi-spectral vehicle Re-identification (ReID) is significantly degraded when some important discriminative cues in visible, near infrared and thermal infrared spectra are lost. Existing methods generate or enhance missing details in low-quality spectra data using the high-quality one, generally called the primary spectrum, but how to justify the primary spectrum is a challenging problem. In addition, when the quality of the primary spectrum is low, the enhancement effect would be greatly degraded, thus limiting the performance of multi-spectral vehicle ReID. To address these problems, we propose the Collaborative Enhancement Network (CoEN), which generates a high-quality proxy from all spectra data and leverages it to supervise the selection of primary spectrum and enhance all spectra features in a collaborative manner, for robust multi-spectral vehicle ReID. First, to integrate the rich cues from all spectra data, we design the Proxy Generator (PG) to progressively aggregate multi-spectral features. Second, we design the Dynamic Quality Sort Module (DQSM), which sorts all spectra data by measuring their correlations with the proxy, to accurately select the primary spectra with the highest correlation. Finally, we design the Collaborative Enhancement Module (CEM) to effectively compensate for missing contents of all spectra by collaborating the primary spectra and the proxy, thereby mitigating the impact of low-quality primary spectra. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach against other multi-spectral vehicle ReID methods. The codes will be released at https://github.com/yongqisun/CoEN.

<title>Memory-Augmented Dual-Decoder Networks for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14884</link>

arXiv:2504.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have shifted from single-class to multi-class scenarios. In such complex contexts, the increasing pattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based approaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share compositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high fidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2) insufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as intricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully reconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting in false positives. Existing methods typically focus on addressing the former, which unintentionally exacerbate the latter, resulting in inadequate representation of intricate normal patterns. To concurrently address these two challenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This network includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation Network (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the DRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features from synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features that maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between features produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond the conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing false positives and enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CMM explicitly encodes and preserves class-specific normal prototypes, actively steering the network away from anomaly reconstruction. Comprehensive experimental results across several benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our MDD-Net framework over current SoTA approaches in multi-class UAD tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel retinal vessel segmentation network, the Weighted Multi-Kernel Attention Network (WMKA-Net), which aims to address the issues of insufficient multiscale feature capture, loss of contextual information, and noise sensitivity in retinal vessel segmentation. WMKA-Net significantly improves the segmentation performance of small vessels and low-contrast regions by integrating several innovative components, including the MultiKernelFeature Fusion Module (MKDC), the Progressive Feature Weighting Fusion Strategy (UDFF), and the Attention Mechanism Module (AttentionBlock). The MKDC module employs multiscale parallel convolutional kernels to extract vessel characteristics, thereby enhancing the ability to capture complex vascular structures. The UDFF strategy optimizes the transmission of feature information by weighted fusion of high- and low-level features. The AttentionBlock highlights key regions and suppresses noise interference through the attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves excellent segmentation performance in multiple public datasets, particularly in segmentation of small vessels and processing of pathological regions. This work provides a robust and efficient new method for segmentation of the retinal vessel.

Abstract: Camera and human motion controls have been extensively studied for video generation, but existing approaches typically address them separately, suffering from limited data with high-quality annotations for both aspects. To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The performance of OCR has improved with the evolution of AI technology. As OCR continues to broaden its range of applications, the increased likelihood of interference introduced by various usage environments can prevent it from achieving its inherent performance. This results in reduced recognition accuracy under certain conditions, and makes the quality control of recognition devices more challenging. Therefore, to ensure that users can properly utilize OCR, we compiled the real-world external disturbance factors that cause performance degradation, along with the resulting image degradation phenomena, into an external disturbance factor table and, by also indicating how to make use of it, organized them into guidelines.

<title>GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>

arXiv:2504.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen categories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts with visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly locate desired objects in cluttered environments, relying on a cognitive mechanism known as visual search to efficiently filter out irrelevant information and focus on task-related regions. Inspired by this process, we propose Dyfo (Dynamic Focus), a training-free dynamic focusing visual search method that enhances fine-grained visual understanding in large multimodal models (LMMs). Unlike existing approaches which require additional modules or data collection, Dyfo leverages a bidirectional interaction between LMMs and visual experts, using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to simulate human-like focus adjustments. This enables LMMs to focus on key visual regions while filtering out irrelevant content, without introducing additional training caused by vocabulary expansion or the integration of specialized localization modules. Experimental results demonstrate that Dyfo significantly improves fine-grained visual understanding and reduces hallucination issues in LMMs, achieving superior performance across both fixed and dynamic resolution models.

<title>Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong Spatial-Temporal Consistency in the Frequency Domain on Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14921</link>

arXiv:2504.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been shown to significantly enhance adversarial robustness via a min-max optimization approach. However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.

Abstract: In today's age of social media and marketing, copyright issues can be a major roadblock to the free sharing of images. Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have significantly reduced the computational time and improved the spatial resolution of particle image velocimetry~(PIV). However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository https://github.com/Zhu-Qianyu/PIV-FlowDiffuser.

Abstract: Recent studies have combined 3D Gaussian and 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to construct high-quality 3D head avatars. In this line of research, existing methods either fail to capture the dynamic textures or incur significant overhead in terms of runtime speed or storage space. To this end, we propose a novel method that addresses all the aforementioned demands. In specific, we introduce an expressive and compact representation that encodes texture-related attributes of the 3D Gaussians in the tensorial format. We store appearance of neutral expression in static tri-planes, and represents dynamic texture details for different expressions using lightweight 1D feature lines, which are then decoded into opacity offset relative to the neutral face. We further propose adaptive truncated opacity penalty and class-balanced sampling to improve generalization across different expressions. Experiments show this design enables accurate face dynamic details capturing while maintains real-time rendering and significantly reduces storage costs, thus broadening the applicability to more scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of 3D generation, achieving controllability, i.e., ensuring consistency between generated 3D content and input conditions like edge and depth, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often struggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose \name{}, a new framework that enhances controllable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between the second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the first-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we employ an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an input condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control signal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the extracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated output is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another round of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two consistency constraints. \emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the two generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate generative diversity. \emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted signal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric details throughout the process. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} significantly improves controllability, especially for fine-grained details, outperforming existing methods across various conditions (e.g., +14.17\% PSNR for edge, +6.26\% PSNR for sketch).

Abstract: Controllable character animation remains a challenging problem, particularly in handling rare poses, stylized characters, character-object interactions, complex illumination, and dynamic scenes. To tackle these issues, prior work has largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate bypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model is powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible fine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step towards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we introduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our sufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is suboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong baseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and "large batches and small iterations" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while maximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we introduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges, complementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video dataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that RealisDance-DiT outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 3.49 million questions and 3.32 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on eight representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available at https://github.com/SEU-VIPGroup/FG-BMK.

Abstract: In this work, we build the first benchmark dataset for short-form UGC Image Super-resolution in the wild, termed KwaiSR, intending to advance the research on developing image super-resolution algorithms for short-form UGC platforms. This dataset is collected from the Kwai Platform, which is composed of two parts, i.e., synthetic and wild parts. Among them, the synthetic dataset, including 1,900 image pairs, is produced by simulating the degradation following the distribution of real-world low-quality short-form UGC images, aiming to provide the ground truth for training and objective comparison in the validation/testing. The wild dataset contains low-quality images collected directly from the Kwai Platform, which are filtered using the quality assessment method KVQ from the Kwai Platform. As a result, the KwaiSR dataset contains 1800 synthetic image pairs and 1900 wild images, which are divided into training, validation, and testing parts with a ratio of 8:1:1. Based on the KwaiSR dataset, we organize the NTIRE 2025 challenge on a second short-form UGC Video quality assessment and enhancement, which attracts lots of researchers to develop the algorithm for it. The results of this competition have revealed that our KwaiSR dataset is pretty challenging for existing Image SR methods, which is expected to lead to a new direction in the image super-resolution field. The dataset can be found from https://lixinustc.github.io/NTIRE2025-KVQE-KwaSR-KVQ.github.io/.

Abstract: Eye-tracking analysis plays a vital role in medical imaging, providing key insights into how radiologists visually interpret and diagnose clinical cases. In this work, we first analyze radiologists' attention and agreement by measuring the distribution of various eye-movement patterns, including saccades direction, amplitude, and their joint distribution. These metrics help uncover patterns in attention allocation and diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, we investigate whether and how doctors' gaze behavior shifts when viewing authentic (Real) versus deep-learning-generated (Fake) images. To achieve this, we examine fixation bias maps, focusing on first, last, short, and longest fixations independently, along with detailed saccades patterns, to quantify differences in gaze distribution and visual saliency between authentic and synthetic images.

Abstract: This work presents Insert Anything, a unified framework for reference-based image insertion that seamlessly integrates objects from reference images into target scenes under flexible, user-specified control guidance. Instead of training separate models for individual tasks, our approach is trained once on our new AnyInsertion dataset--comprising 120K prompt-image pairs covering diverse tasks such as person, object, and garment insertion--and effortlessly generalizes to a wide range of insertion scenarios. Such a challenging setting requires capturing both identity features and fine-grained details, while allowing versatile local adaptations in style, color, and texture. To this end, we propose to leverage the multimodal attention of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to support both mask- and text-guided editing. Furthermore, we introduce an in-context editing mechanism that treats the reference image as contextual information, employing two prompting strategies to harmonize the inserted elements with the target scene while faithfully preserving their distinctive features. Extensive experiments on AnyInsertion, DreamBooth, and VTON-HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing alternatives, underscoring its great potential in real-world applications such as creative content generation, virtual try-on, and scene composition.

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Compositional text-to-video generation, which requires synthesizing dynamic scenes with multiple interacting entities and precise spatial-temporal relationships, remains a critical challenge for diffusion-based models. Existing methods struggle with layout discontinuity, entity identity drift, and implausible interaction dynamics due to unconstrained cross-attention mechanisms and inadequate physics-aware reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose DyST-XL, a \textbf{training-free} framework that enhances off-the-shelf text-to-video models (e.g., CogVideoX-5B) through frame-aware control. DyST-XL integrates three key innovations: (1) A Dynamic Layout Planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse input prompts into entity-attribute graphs and generates physics-aware keyframe layouts, with intermediate frames interpolated via trajectory optimization; (2) A Dual-Prompt Controlled Attention Mechanism that enforces localized text-video alignment through frame-aware attention masking, achieving the precise control over individual entities; and (3) An Entity-Consistency Constraint strategy that propagates first-frame feature embeddings to subsequent frames during denoising, preserving object identity without manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that DyST-XL excels in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly improving performance on complex prompts and bridging a crucial gap in training-free video synthesis.

Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) suffers from a key challenge in preserving old knowledge while adapting to new information. The existing solutions include rehearsal-based and rehearsal-free methods to address this challenge. Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation, continuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process. Rehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain, leading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores cross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution integration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a Text-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich prompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained representations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of identity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution awareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed to capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and adaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In this manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation learning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a Knowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level discrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate model adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote knowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific distributions, respectively. Experimental results show that our DAFC outperform state-of-the-art methods by at least 9.8\%/6.6\% and 6.4\%/6.2\% of average mAP/R@1 on two training orders.

Abstract: With the fast pace of 3D capture technology and resulting abundance of 3D data, effective 3D scene editing becomes essential for a variety of graphics applications. In this work we present ScanEdit, an instruction-driven method for functional editing of complex, real-world 3D scans. To model large and interdependent sets of ob- jectswe propose a hierarchically-guided approach. Given a 3D scan decomposed into its object instances, we first construct a hierarchical scene graph representation to enable effective, tractable editing. We then leverage reason- ing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and translate high-level language instructions into actionable commands applied hierarchically to the scene graph. Fi- nally, ScanEdit integrates LLM-based guidance with ex- plicit physical constraints and generates realistic scenes where object arrangements obey both physics and common sense. In our extensive experimental evaluation ScanEdit outperforms state of the art and demonstrates excellent re- sults for a variety of real-world scenes and input instruc- tions.

Abstract: While the diffusion transformer (DiT) has become a focal point of interest in recent years, its application in low-light image enhancement remains a blank area for exploration. Current methods recover the details from low-light images while inevitably amplifying the noise in images, resulting in poor visual quality. In this paper, we firstly introduce DiT into the low-light enhancement task and design a novel Structure-guided Diffusion Transformer based Low-light image enhancement (SDTL) framework. We compress the feature through wavelet transform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the multi-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement Module (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an adaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect. In Addition, we propose a Structure-guided Attention Block (SAB) to pay more attention to texture-riched tokens and avoid interference from noisy areas in noise prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on several popular datasets, validating the effectiveness of SDTL in improving image quality and the potential of DiT in low-light enhancement tasks.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences through intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Hierarchical Attention Fusion of Visual and Textual Representations (HAF-VT), a novel approach integrating visual and textual data to enhance cognitive modeling. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching item representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism jointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human information integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT outperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging cognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of multimodal data in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) aims to predict per-pixel depth values from a single RGB image. Recent advancements have positioned diffusion models as effective MDE tools by framing the challenge as a conditional image generation task. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle with accurately reconstructing distant depths, due largely to the imbalanced distribution of depth values and an over-reliance on spatial-domain features. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework that integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature enhancements with an adaptive weight-balancing mechanism into the diffusion process. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation (LFM) module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, thereby improving the preservation of structural details and reducing noisy artifacts. Furthermore, we implement an adaptive weighting strategy that modulates the diffusion loss in real-time, enhancing the model's sensitivity towards distant depth reconstruction. These innovations collectively result in superior depth perception performance across both distance and detail. Experimental evaluations confirm that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion-based MDE techniques, particularly excelling in the accurate reconstruction of distant regions.

Abstract: Latent fingerprint enhancement is a critical step in the process of latent fingerprint identification. Existing deep learning-based enhancement methods still fall short of practical application requirements, particularly in restoring low-quality fingerprint regions. Recognizing that different regions of latent fingerprints require distinct enhancement strategies, we propose a Triple Branch Spatial Fusion Network (TBSFNet), which simultaneously enhances different regions of the image using tailored strategies. Furthermore, to improve the generalization capability of the network, we integrate orientation field and minutiae-related modules into TBSFNet and introduce a Multi-Level Feature Guidance Network (MLFGNet). Experimental results on the MOLF and MUST datasets demonstrate that MLFGNet outperforms existing enhancement algorithms.

Abstract: While existing implicit neural network-based image unwarping methods perform well on natural images, they struggle to handle screen content images (SCIs), which often contain large geometric distortions, text, symbols, and sharp edges. To address this, we propose a structure-texture enhancement network (STEN) with transformation self-estimation for SCI warping. STEN integrates a B-spline implicit neural representation module and a transformation error estimation and self-correction algorithm. It comprises two branches: the structure estimation branch (SEB), which enhances local aggregation and global dependency modeling, and the texture estimation branch (TEB), which improves texture detail synthesis using B-spline implicit neural representation. Additionally, the transformation self-estimation module autonomously estimates the transformation error and corrects the coordinate transformation matrix, effectively handling real-world image distortions. Extensive experiments on public SCI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Comparisons on well-known natural image datasets also show the potential of our approach for natural image distortion.

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound within an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard in SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector each, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous work samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates all local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from optimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual target in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic issue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots competitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and off-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio are used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention matching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method achieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL, and substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for surface normal estimation from rectified stereo image pairs, leveraging affine transformations derived from disparity values to achieve fast and accurate results. We demonstrate how the rectification of stereo image pairs simplifies the process of surface normal estimation by reducing computational complexity. To address noise reduction, we develop a custom algorithm inspired by convolutional operations, tailored to process disparity data efficiently. We also introduce adaptive heuristic techniques for efficiently detecting connected surface components within the images, further improving the robustness of the method. By integrating these methods, we construct a surface normal estimator that is both fast and accurate, producing a dense, oriented point cloud as the final output. Our method is validated using both simulated environments and real-world stereo images from the Middlebury and Cityscapes datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in real-time performance and accuracy when implemented on a GPU. Upon acceptance, the shader source code will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present MoBGS, a novel deblurring dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework capable of reconstructing sharp and high-quality novel spatio-temporal views from blurry monocular videos in an end-to-end manner. Existing dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are highly sensitive to motion blur in casually captured videos, resulting in significant degradation of rendering quality. While recent approaches address motion-blurred inputs for NVS, they primarily focus on static scene reconstruction and lack dedicated motion modeling for dynamic objects. To overcome these limitations, our MoBGS introduces a novel Blur-adaptive Latent Camera Estimation (BLCE) method for effective latent camera trajectory estimation, improving global camera motion deblurring. In addition, we propose a physically-inspired Latent Camera-induced Exposure Estimation (LCEE) method to ensure consistent deblurring of both global camera and local object motion. Our MoBGS framework ensures the temporal consistency of unseen latent timestamps and robust motion decomposition of static and dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world blurry videos show that our MoBGS significantly outperforms the very recent advanced methods (DyBluRF and Deblur4DGS), achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic NVS under motion blur.

<title>Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Learning with Local-to-Global Geometric Aggregation for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and size of previously unseen instances from predefined categories, requiring strong generalization across diverse object instances. Although many previous methods attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes. To address this challenge, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our approach first predicts semantically consistent and geometric informative keypoints through an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Generator, then refines them with: (1) a Local Keypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing backward feature sequences. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a separation loss to enforce uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint distribution. The generated keypoints are finally mapped to a canonical space for regressing the object's 6D pose and size. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D demonstrate that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Expressing complex concepts is easy when they can be labeled or quantified, but many ideas are hard to define yet instantly recognizable. We propose a Mood Board, where users convey abstract concepts with examples that hint at the intended direction of attribute changes. We compute an underlying Mood Space that 1) factors out irrelevant features and 2) finds the connections between images, thus bringing relevant concepts closer. We invent a fibration computation to compress/decompress pre-trained features into/from a compact space, 50-100x smaller. The main innovation is learning to mimic the pairwise affinity relationship of the image tokens across exemplars. To focus on the coarse-to-fine hierarchical structures in the Mood Space, we compute the top eigenvector structure from the affinity matrix and define a loss in the eigenvector space. The resulting Mood Space is locally linear and compact, allowing image-level operations, such as object averaging, visual analogy, and pose transfer, to be performed as a simple vector operation in Mood Space. Our learning is efficient in computation without any fine-tuning, needs only a few (2-20) exemplars, and takes less than a minute to learn.

Abstract: Liver registration by overlaying preoperative 3D models onto intraoperative 2D frames can assist surgeons in perceiving the spatial anatomy of the liver clearly for a higher surgical success rate. Existing registration methods rely heavily on anatomical landmark-based workflows, which encounter two major limitations: 1) ambiguous landmark definitions fail to provide efficient markers for registration; 2) insufficient integration of intraoperative liver visual information in shape deformation modeling. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a landmark-free preoperative-to-intraoperative registration framework utilizing effective self-supervised learning, termed \ourmodel. This framework transforms the conventional 3D-2D workflow into a 3D-3D registration pipeline, which is then decoupled into rigid and non-rigid registration subtasks. \ourmodel~first introduces a feature-disentangled transformer to learn robust correspondences for recovering rigid transformations. Further, a structure-regularized deformation network is designed to adjust the preoperative model to align with the intraoperative liver surface. This network captures structural correlations through geometry similarity modeling in a low-rank transformer network. To facilitate the validation of the registration performance, we also construct an in-vivo registration dataset containing liver resection videos of 21 patients, called \emph{P2I-LReg}, which contains 346 keyframes that provide a global view of the liver together with liver mask annotations and calibrated camera intrinsic parameters. Extensive experiments and user studies on both synthetic and in-vivo datasets demonstrate the superiority and potential clinical applicability of our method.

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes KANet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of 3D KAN Conv and an adaptive grid update mechanism. By introducing learnable univariate B-spline functions on network edges, specifically by flattening three-dimensional neighborhoods into vectors and applying B-spline-parameterized nonlinear activation functions to replace the fixed linear weights of traditional 3D convolutional kernels, we precisely capture complex spectral-spatial nonlinear relationships in hyperspectral data. Simultaneously, through a dynamic grid adjustment mechanism, we adaptively update the grid point positions of B-splines based on the statistical characteristics of input data, optimizing the resolution of spline functions to match the non-uniform distribution of spectral features, significantly improving the model's accuracy in high-dimensional data modeling and parameter efficiency, effectively alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This characteristic demonstrates superior neural scaling laws compared to traditional convolutional neural networks and reduces overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. KANet enhances model representation capability through a 3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

arXiv:2504.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models have been extensively adopted for real-world image restoration because of their powerful generative prior. However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.

Abstract: Aerial object detection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) faces critical challenges including sub-10px targets, dense occlusions, and stringent computational constraints. Existing detectors struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency due to rigid receptive fields and redundant architectures. To address these limitations, we propose Variable Receptive Field DETR (VRF-DETR), a transformer-based detector incorporating three key components: 1) Multi-Scale Context Fusion (MSCF) module that dynamically recalibrates features through adaptive spatial attention and gated multi-scale fusion, 2) Gated Convolution (GConv) layer enabling parameter-efficient local-context modeling via depthwise separable operations and dynamic gating, and 3) Gated Multi-scale Fusion (GMCF) Bottleneck that hierarchically disentangles occluded objects through cascaded global-local interactions. Experiments on VisDrone2019 demonstrate VRF-DETR achieves 51.4\% mAP\textsubscript{50} and 31.8\% mAP\textsubscript{50:95} with only 13.5M parameters. This work establishes a new efficiency-accuracy Pareto frontier for UAV-based detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have improved Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR), but existing methods lack human feedback integration, risking misalignment with human preference and may leading to artifacts, hallucinations and harmful content generation. To this end, we are the first to introduce human preference alignment into Real-ISR, a technique that has been successfully applied in Large Language Models and Text-to-Image tasks to effectively enhance the alignment of generated outputs with human preferences. Specifically, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into Real-ISR to achieve alignment, where DPO serves as a general alignment technique that directly learns from the human preference dataset. Nevertheless, unlike high-level tasks, the pixel-level reconstruction objectives of Real-ISR are difficult to reconcile with the image-level preferences of DPO, which can lead to the DPO being overly sensitive to local anomalies, leading to reduced generation quality. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Direct Semantic Preference Optimization (DSPO) to align instance-level human preferences by incorporating semantic guidance, which is through two strategies: (a) semantic instance alignment strategy, implementing instance-level alignment to ensure fine-grained perceptual consistency, and (b) user description feedback strategy, mitigating hallucinations through semantic textual feedback on instance-level images. As a plug-and-play solution, DSPO proves highly effective in both one-step and multi-step SR frameworks.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for generating high-quality, animatable 4D avatar from a single image. While recent advances have shown promising results in 4D avatar creation, existing methods either require extensive multiview data or struggle with shape accuracy and identity consistency. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive system that leverages shape, image, and video priors to create full-view, animatable avatars. Our approach first obtains initial coarse shape through 3D-GAN inversion. Then, it enhances multiview textures using depth-guided warping signals for cross-view consistency with the help of the image diffusion model. To handle expression animation, we incorporate a video prior with synchronized driving signals across viewpoints. We further introduce a Consistent-Inconsistent training to effectively handle data inconsistencies during 4D reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior quality compared to the prior art, while maintaining consistency across different viewpoints and expressions.

Abstract: The recent surge in open-source text-to-video generation models has significantly energized the research community, yet their dependence on proprietary training datasets remains a key constraint. While existing open datasets like Koala-36M employ algorithmic filtering of web-scraped videos from early platforms, they still lack the quality required for fine-tuning advanced video generation models. We present Tiger200K, a manually curated high visual quality video dataset sourced from User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms. By prioritizing visual fidelity and aesthetic quality, Tiger200K underscores the critical role of human expertise in data curation, and providing high-quality, temporally consistent video-text pairs for fine-tuning and optimizing video generation architectures through a simple but effective pipeline including shot boundary detection, OCR, border detecting, motion filter and fine bilingual caption. The dataset will undergo ongoing expansion and be released as an open-source initiative to advance research and applications in video generative models.

<title>Breast density in MRI: an AI-based quantification and relationship to assessment in mammography</title>

Abstract: Mammographic breast density is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer. Recently there has been interest in breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography, as this modality provides an orthogonal and highly quantitative assessment of breast tissue. However, its 3D nature poses analytic challenges related to delineating and aggregating complex structures across slices. Here, we applied an in-house machine-learning algorithm to assess breast density on normal breasts in three MRI datasets. Breast density was consistent across different datasets (0.104 - 0.114). Analysis across different age groups also demonstrated strong consistency across datasets and confirmed a trend of decreasing density with age as reported in previous studies. MR breast density was correlated with mammographic breast density, although some notable differences suggest that certain breast density components are captured only on MRI. Future work will determine how to integrate MR breast density with current tools to improve future breast cancer risk prediction.

<title>Automated Measurement of Eczema Severity with Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Automated diagnosis of eczema using images acquired from digital camera can enable individuals to self-monitor their recovery. The process entails first segmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity of eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated eczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the severity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated data to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited training data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation, where we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot segmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and classification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and feed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of eczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated "in-the-wild" eczema images, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 $\pm$ 0.01) the state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted F1: 0.44 $\pm$ 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 $\pm$ 0.22). Our results show that self-supervised learning can be a viable solution for automated skin diagnosis where labeled data is scarce.

<title>Zero-Shot, But at What Cost? Unveiling the Hidden Overhead of MILS's LLM-CLIP Framework for Image Captioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15199</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver) is a recently published framework that claims "LLMs can see and hear without any training" by leveraging an iterative, LLM-CLIP based approach for zero-shot image captioning. While this MILS approach demonstrates good performance, our investigation reveals that this success comes at a hidden, substantial computational cost due to its expensive multi-step refinement process. In contrast, alternative models such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4V achieve competitive results through a streamlined, single-pass approach. We hypothesize that the significant overhead inherent in MILS's iterative process may undermine its practical benefits, thereby challenging the narrative that zero-shot performance can be attained without incurring heavy resource demands. This work is the first to expose and quantify the trade-offs between output quality and computational cost in MILS, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient multimodal models.

<title>Shape-Guided Clothing Warping for Virtual Try-On</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15232</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on aims to seamlessly fit in-shop clothing to a person image while maintaining pose consistency. Existing methods commonly employ the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform in-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising performance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details, leading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as well as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed SCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb textures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and try-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we devise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow path. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's body, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and post-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance flow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results, we integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network based on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are able to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and precise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/xyhanHIT/SCW-VTON.

<title>Bringing Diversity from Diffusion Models to Semantic-Guided Face Asset Generation</title>

Abstract: Digital modeling and reconstruction of human faces serve various applications. However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.

Abstract: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides crucial insights into the microstructure of the human brain, but it can be time-consuming to acquire compared to more readily available T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion bridge model for 3D brain image translation between T1w MRI and DTI modalities. Our model learns to generate high-quality DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) images from T1w images and vice versa, enabling cross-modality data augmentation and reducing the need for extensive DTI acquisition. We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data. Our diffusion bridge model offers a promising solution for improving neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical decision-making, with the potential to significantly impact neuroimaging research and clinical practice.

<title>An LMM for Efficient Video Understanding via Reinforced Compression of Video Cubes</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) uniformly perceive video frames, creating computational inefficiency for videos with inherently varying temporal information density. This paper present \textbf{Quicksviewer}, an LMM with new perceiving paradigm that partitions a video of nonuniform density into varying cubes using Gumbel Softmax, followed by a unified resampling for each cube to achieve efficient video understanding. This simple and intuitive approach dynamically compress video online based on its temporal density, significantly reducing spatiotemporal redundancy (overall 45$\times$ compression rate), while enabling efficient training with large receptive field. We train the model from a language backbone through three progressive stages, each incorporating lengthy videos on average of 420s/1fps thanks to the perceiving efficiency. With only 0.8M total video-text samples for training, our model outperforms the direct baseline employing a fixed partitioning strategy by a maximum of 8.72 in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness in performance. On Video-MME, Quicksviewer achieves SOTA under modest sequence lengths using just up to 5\% of tokens per frame required by baselines. With this paradigm, scaling up the number of input frames reveals a clear power law of the model capabilities. It is also empirically verified that the segments generated by the cubing network can help for analyzing continuous events in videos.

Abstract: We introduce Eagle 2.5, a family of frontier vision-language models (VLMs) for long-context multimodal learning. Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.

Abstract: Creating virtual digital replicas from real-world data unlocks significant potential across domains like gaming and robotics. In this paper, we present DRAWER, a novel framework that converts a video of a static indoor scene into a photorealistic and interactive digital environment. Our approach centers on two main contributions: (i) a reconstruction module based on a dual scene representation that reconstructs the scene with fine-grained geometric details, and (ii) an articulation module that identifies articulation types and hinge positions, reconstructs simulatable shapes and appearances and integrates them into the scene. The resulting virtual environment is photorealistic, interactive, and runs in real time, with compatibility for game engines and robotic simulation platforms. We demonstrate the potential of DRAWER by using it to automatically create an interactive game in Unreal Engine and to enable real-to-sim-to-real transfer for robotics applications.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is a core component of human intelligence and a critical capability for advanced multimodal models. Yet current reasoning evaluations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often rely on text descriptions and allow language-based reasoning shortcuts, failing to measure genuine vision-centric reasoning. To address this, we introduce VisuLogic: a benchmark of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories (e.g., quantitative shifts, spatial relations, attribute comparisons). These various types of questions can be evaluated to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs from multiple perspectives. We evaluate leading MLLMs on this benchmark and analyze their results to identify common failure modes. Most models score below 30% accuracy-only slightly above the 25% random baseline and far below the 51.4% achieved by humans-revealing significant gaps in visual reasoning. Furthermore, we provide a supplementary training dataset and a reinforcement-learning baseline to support further progress.

<title>Seeing from Another Perspective: Evaluating Multi-View Understanding in MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/.

arXiv:2504.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in photorealistic scene reconstruction but struggles with stylized scenarios (e.g., cartoons, games) due to fragmented textures, semantic misalignment, and limited adaptability to abstract aesthetics. We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering. This work bridges photorealistic 3D GS and artistic stylization, unlocking applications in gaming, virtual worlds, and digital art.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.

Abstract: Physical rehabilitation exercises suggested by healthcare professionals can help recovery from various musculoskeletal disorders and prevent re-injury. However, patients' engagement tends to decrease over time without direct supervision, which is why there is a need for an automated monitoring system. In recent years, there has been great progress in quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises. Most of them only provide a binary classification if the performance is correct or incorrect, and a few provide a continuous score. This information is not sufficient for patients to improve their performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm for error classification of rehabilitation exercises, thus making the first step toward more detailed feedback to patients. We focus on skeleton-based exercise assessment, which utilizes human pose estimation to evaluate motion. Inspired by recent algorithms for quality assessment during rehabilitation exercises, we propose a Transformer-based model for the described classification. Our model is inspired by the HyperFormer method for human action recognition, and adapted to our problem and dataset. The evaluation is done on the KERAAL dataset, as it is the only medical dataset with clear error labels for the exercises, and our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we bridge the gap towards better feedback to the patients by presenting a way to calculate the importance of joints for each exercise.

Abstract: Multimedia learning using text and images has been shown to improve learning outcomes compared to text-only instruction. But conversational AI systems in education predominantly rely on text-based interactions while multimodal conversations for multimedia learning remain unexplored. Moreover, deploying conversational AI in learning contexts requires grounding in reliable sources and verifiability to create trust. We present MuDoC, a Multimodal Document-grounded Conversational AI system based on GPT-4o, that leverages both text and visuals from documents to generate responses interleaved with text and images. Its interface allows verification of AI generated content through seamless navigation to the source. We compare MuDoC to a text-only system to explore differences in learner engagement, trust in AI system, and their performance on problem-solving tasks. Our findings indicate that both visuals and verifiability of content enhance learner engagement and foster trust; however, no significant impact in performance was observed. We draw upon theories from cognitive and learning sciences to interpret the findings and derive implications, and outline future directions for the development of multimodal conversational AI systems in education.

<title>Multiscale Tensor Summation Factorization as a New Neural Network Layer (MTS Layer) for Multidimensional Data Processing</title>

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), or fully connected artificial neural networks, are known for performing vector-matrix multiplications using learnable weight matrices; however, their practical application in many machine learning tasks, especially in computer vision, can be limited due to the high dimensionality of input-output pairs at each layer. To improve efficiency, convolutional operators have been utilized to facilitate weight sharing and local connections, yet they are constrained by limited receptive fields. In this paper, we introduce Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel neural network operator that implements tensor summation at multiple scales, where each tensor to be summed is obtained through Tucker-decomposition-like mode products. Unlike other tensor decomposition methods in the literature, MTS is not introduced as a network compression tool; instead, as a new backbone neural layer. MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while enhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense layers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also demonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept experimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across various tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration. Additionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the multi-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural network, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff compared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision applications. The software implementation of the MTS layer and the corresponding MTS-based networks, MTSNets, is shared at https://github.com/mehmetyamac/MTSNet.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of infrared (IR) camera technology to enhance driver safety for emergency vehicles operating in low-visibility conditions, particularly at night and in dense fog. Such environments significantly increase the risk of collisions, especially for tow trucks and snowplows that must remain operational in challenging conditions. Conventional driver assistance systems often struggle under these conditions due to limited visibility. In contrast, IR cameras, which detect the thermal signatures of obstacles, offer a promising alternative. The evaluation combines controlled laboratory experiments, real-world field tests, and surveys of emergency vehicle operators. In addition to assessing detection performance, the study examines the feasibility of retrofitting existing Department of Transportation (DoT) fleets with cost-effective IR-based driver assistance systems. Results underscore the utility of IR technology in enhancing driver awareness and provide data-driven recommendations for scalable deployment across legacy emergency vehicle fleets.

Abstract: Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.

Abstract: Prompt learning is a popular fine-tuning method for vision-language models due to its efficiency. It requires a small number of additional learnable parameters while significantly enhancing performance on target tasks. However, most existing methods suffer from overfitting to fine-tuning data, yielding poor generalizability. To address this, we propose a new training objective function based on a Bayesian learning principle to balance adaptability and generalizability. We derive a prior over the logits, where the mean function is parameterized by the pre-trained model, while the posterior corresponds to the fine-tuned model. This objective establishes a balance by allowing the fine-tuned model to adapt to downstream tasks while remaining close to the pre-trained model.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulation is essential for robotics research, enabling safe and efficient testing of perception, control, and navigation algorithms. However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework--the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL) that integrates the Unreal Engine's advanced rendering capabilities with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical for evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: We present PRISM, a unified framework that enables multiple image generation and editing tasks in a single foundational model. Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.

<title>HoLa: B-Rep Generation using a Holistic Latent Representation</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of $\textit{boundary representations}$ (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\approx$50%.

<title>SEGA: Drivable 3D Gaussian Head Avatar from a Single Image</title>

Abstract: Creating photorealistic 3D head avatars from limited input has become increasingly important for applications in virtual reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.

Abstract: This report details MERL's system for room impulse response (RIR) estimation submitted to the Generative Data Augmentation Workshop at ICASSP 2025 for Augmenting RIR Data (Task 1) and Improving Speaker Distance Estimation (Task 2). We first pre-train a neural acoustic field conditioned by room geometry on an external large-scale dataset in which pairs of RIRs and the geometries are provided. The neural acoustic field is then adapted to each target room by using the enrollment data, where we leverage either the provided room geometries or geometries retrieved from the external dataset, depending on availability. Lastly, we predict the RIRs for each pair of source and receiver locations specified by Task 1, and use these RIRs to train the speaker distance estimation model in Task 2.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of registering two rigid semantic scene graphs, an essential capability when an autonomous agent needs to register its map against a remote agent, or against a prior map. The hand-crafted descriptors in classical semantic-aided registration, or the ground-truth annotation reliance in learning-based scene graph registration, impede their application in practical real-world environments. To address the challenges, we design a scene graph network to encode multiple modalities of semantic nodes: open-set semantic feature, local topology with spatial awareness, and shape feature. These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features. The matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation according to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and hierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and fewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new data generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping module to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from previous works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate data. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark. It significantly outperforms the hand-crafted baseline in terms of registration success rate. Compared to visual loop closure networks, our method achieves a slightly higher registration recall while requiring only 52 KB of communication bandwidth for each query frame.

<title>Towards Model Resistant to Transferable Adversarial Examples via Trigger Activation</title>

Abstract: Adversarial examples, characterized by imperceptible perturbations, pose significant threats to deep neural networks by misleading their predictions. A critical aspect of these examples is their transferability, allowing them to deceive {unseen} models in black-box scenarios. Despite the widespread exploration of defense methods, including those on transferability, they show limitations: inefficient deployment, ineffective defense, and degraded performance on clean images. In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way. We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data $\boldsymbol{x}$ as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data $\boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{\tau}$. Importantly, the trigger $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as \textbf{models with trigger activation}. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI highlights the importance of text-to-image (T2I) security, particularly with the threat of backdoor poisoning. Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%. This work aims to heighten awareness regarding this security vulnerability in editable image generation models.

Abstract: Building a generalizable self-correction system is crucial for robots to recover from failures. Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure, translating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic actions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the Phoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect high-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In this motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process motion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection into coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion instruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a multi-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual observations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these two models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the low-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and facilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this framework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically improve the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in both the RoboMimic simulation and real-world scenarios prove the superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires explicit or implicit knowledge of the robot's joint positions. Precise proprioception is standard in high-quality industrial robots but is often unavailable in inexpensive robots operating in unstructured environments. In this paper, we ask: to what extent can a fast, single-pass regression architecture perform visual proprioception from a single external camera image, available even in the simplest manipulation settings? We explore several latent representations, including CNNs, VAEs, ViTs, and bags of uncalibrated fiducial markers, using fine-tuning techniques adapted to the limited data available. We evaluate the achievable accuracy through experiments on an inexpensive 6-DoF robot.

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models with a pretraining-finetuning paradigm have led to a surge of numerous task-specific models fine-tuned from a common pre-trained model. Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging these large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple arithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge: interference between model parameters fine-tuned on different tasks. Few recent works have focused on designing a new fine-tuning scheme that can lead to small parameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each task-specific fine-tuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model. To improve the performance of a merged model, we note that a fine-tuning scheme should aim for (1) smaller parameter interference and (2) better performance of each fine-tuned model on the corresponding task. In this work, we aim to design a new fine-tuning objective function to work towards these two goals. In the course of this process, we find such objective function to be strikingly similar to sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objective function, which aims to achieve generalization by finding flat minima. Drawing upon our observation, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained models via sharpness-aware minimization. The experimental and theoretical results showcase the effectiveness and orthogonality of our proposed approach, improving performance upon various merging and fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/baiklab/SAFT-Merge.

Abstract: Humans and most animals inherently possess a distinctive capacity to continually acquire novel experiences and accumulate worldly knowledge over time. This ability, termed continual learning, is also critical for deep neural networks (DNNs) to adapt to the dynamically evolving world in open environments. However, DNNs notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when trained on sequential tasks. In this work, inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system, we propose a novel biomimetic continual learning framework that integrates semi-parametric memory and the wake-sleep consolidation mechanism. For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities.

Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MUL) is crucial for privacy protection and content regulation, yet recent studies reveal that traces of forgotten information persist in unlearned models, enabling adversaries to resurface removed knowledge. Existing verification methods only confirm whether unlearning was executed, failing to detect such residual information leaks. To address this, we introduce the concept of Robust Unlearning, ensuring models are indistinguishable from retraining and resistant to adversarial recovery. To empirically evaluate whether unlearning techniques meet this security standard, we propose the Unlearning Mapping Attack (UMA), a post-unlearning verification framework that actively probes models for forgotten traces using adversarial queries. Extensive experiments on discriminative and generative tasks show that existing unlearning techniques remain vulnerable, even when passing existing verification metrics. By establishing UMA as a practical verification tool, this study sets a new standard for assessing and enhancing machine unlearning security.

Abstract: The small sample imbalance (S&amp;I) problem is a major challenge in machine learning and data analysis. It is characterized by a small number of samples and an imbalanced class distribution, which leads to poor model performance. In addition, indistinct inter-class feature distributions further complicate classification tasks. Existing methods often rely on algorithmic heuristics without sufficiently analyzing the underlying data characteristics. We argue that a detailed analysis from the data perspective is essential before developing an appropriate solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic analytical framework for the S\&amp;I problem. We first summarize imbalance metrics and complexity analysis methods, highlighting the need for interpretable benchmarks to characterize S&amp;I problems. Second, we review recent solutions for conventional, complexity-based, and extreme S&amp;I problems, revealing methodological differences in handling various data distributions. Our summary finds that resampling remains a widely adopted solution. However, we conduct experiments on binary and multiclass datasets, revealing that classifier performance differences significantly exceed the improvements achieved through resampling. Finally, this paper highlights open questions and discusses future trends.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes.

Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on field-of-view (FoV) video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.

Abstract: We present a method that computes an interpretable representation of material appearance within a highly compact, disentangled latent space. This representation is learned in a self-supervised fashion using an adapted FactorVAE. We train our model with a carefully designed unlabeled dataset, avoiding possible biases induced by human-generated labels. Our model demonstrates strong disentanglement and interpretability by effectively encoding material appearance and illumination, despite the absence of explicit supervision. Then, we use our representation as guidance for training a lightweight IP-Adapter to condition a diffusion pipeline that transfers the appearance of one or more images onto a target geometry, and allows the user to further edit the resulting appearance. Our approach offers fine-grained control over the generated results: thanks to the well-structured compact latent space, users can intuitively manipulate attributes such as hue or glossiness in image space to achieve the desired final appearance.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental in deep neural networks and directly impact gradient flow, optimization stability, and generalization. Although ReLU remains standard because of its simplicity, it suffers from vanishing gradients and lacks adaptability. Alternatives like Swish and GELU introduce smooth transitions, but fail to dynamically adjust to input statistics. We propose VeLU, a Variance-enhanced Learning Unit as an activation function that dynamically scales based on input variance by integrating ArcTan-Sin transformations and Wasserstein-2 regularization, effectively mitigating covariate shifts and stabilizing optimization. Extensive experiments on ViT_B16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB3 confirm VeLU's superiority over ReLU, ReLU6, Swish, and GELU on six vision benchmarks. The codes of VeLU are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment, flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world perturbations.

arXiv:2504.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.

Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused primarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in various image generation tasks compared with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). Recent work on semantic image synthesis mainly follows the de facto GAN-based approaches, which may lead to unsatisfactory quality or diversity of generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on DDPM for semantic image synthesis. Unlike previous conditional diffusion model directly feeds the semantic layout and noisy image as input to a U-Net structure, which may not fully leverage the information in the input semantic mask, our framework processes semantic layout and noisy image differently. It feeds noisy image to the encoder of the U-Net structure while the semantic layout to the decoder by multi-layer spatially-adaptive normalization operators. To further improve the generation quality and semantic interpretability in semantic image synthesis, we introduce the classifier-free guidance sampling strategy, which acknowledge the scores of an unconditional model for sampling process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity (FID) and diversity (LPIPS). Our code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/WeilunWang/semantic-diffusion-model.

Abstract: Transformer models have become a promising approach for crop-type classification. Although their attention weights can be used to understand the relevant time points for crop disambiguation, the validity of these insights depends on how closely the attention weights approximate the actual workings of these black-box models, which is not always clear. In this paper, we introduce a novel explainability framework that systematically evaluates the explanatory power of the attention weights of a standard transformer encoder for crop-type classification. Our results show that attention patterns strongly relate to key dates, which are often associated with critical phenological events for crop-type classification. Further, the sensitivity analysis reveals the limited capability of the attention weights to characterize crop phenology as the identified phenological events depend on the other crops considered during training. This limitation highlights the relevance of future work towards the development of deep learning approaches capable of automatically learning the temporal vegetation dynamics for accurate crop disambiguation

Abstract: Most existing methods for text-based person retrieval focus on text-to-image person retrieval. Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.

Abstract: Understanding the semantics of individual regions or patches of unconstrained images, such as open-world object detection, remains a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module. Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set, with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW. Furthermore, it exceeds GroundingDINO-L by 11.0 AP for rare categories on the LVIS minival set.

Abstract: Transformer becomes more popular in the vision domain in recent years so there is a need for finding an effective way to interpret the Transformer model by visualizing it. In recent work, Chefer et al. can visualize the Transformer on vision and multi-modal tasks effectively by combining attention layers to show the importance of each image patch. However, when applying to other variants of Transformer such as the Swin Transformer, this method can not focus on the predicted object. Our method, by considering the statistics of tokens in layer normalization layers, shows a great ability to interpret the explainability of Swin Transformer and ViT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements of sensor technology and deep learning, autonomous driving systems are providing safe and efficient access to intelligent vehicles as well as intelligent transportation. Among these equipped sensors, the radar sensor plays a crucial role in providing robust perception information in diverse environmental conditions. This review focuses on exploring different radar data representations utilized in autonomous driving systems. Firstly, we introduce the capabilities and limitations of the radar sensor by examining the working principles of radar perception and signal processing of radar measurements. Then, we delve into the generation process of five radar representations, including the ADC signal, radar tensor, point cloud, grid map, and micro-Doppler signature. For each radar representation, we examine the related datasets, methods, advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced in these data representations and propose potential research directions. Above all, this comprehensive review offers an in-depth insight into how these representations enhance autonomous system capabilities, providing guidance for radar perception researchers.

Abstract: The popularization of Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models enables the generation of high-quality images from text descriptions. However, generating diverse customized images with reference visual attributes remains challenging. This work focuses on personalizing T2I diffusion models at a more abstract concept or category level, adapting commonalities from a set of reference images while creating new instances with sufficient variations. We introduce a solution that allows a pretrained T2I diffusion model to learn a set of soft prompts, enabling the generation of novel images by sampling prompts from the learned distribution. These prompts offer text-guided editing capabilities and additional flexibility in controlling variation and mixing between multiple distributions. We also show the adaptability of the learned prompt distribution to other tasks, such as text-to-3D. Finally we demonstrate effectiveness of our approach through quantitative analysis including automatic evaluation and human assessment.

Abstract: Qualifying the discrepancy between 3D geometric models, which could be represented with either point clouds or triangle meshes, is a pivotal issue with board applications. Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DirDist, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DirDist based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DirDist, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization. Extensive experiments show that our DirDist achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks. As a generic distance metric, DirDist has the potential to advance the field of 3D geometric modeling. The source code is available at https://github.com/rsy6318/DirDist.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in vision-related tasks, capitalizing on their visual semantic comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, their ability to detect subtle visual spoofing and forgery clues in face attack detection tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, SHIELD, to evaluate MLLMs for face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to assess MLLM performance on multimodal face data across two tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, and depth) under six attack types. For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data, incorporating visual and acoustic modalities. We conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations in standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-attribute chain of thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images. The findings of this study demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit strong potential for addressing the challenges associated with the security of facial recognition technology applications.

Abstract: Recently, feature relation learning has drawn widespread attention in cross-spectral image patch matching. However, existing related research focuses on extracting diverse relations between image patch features and ignores sufficient intrinsic feature representations of individual image patches. Therefore, we propose an innovative relational representation learning idea that simultaneously focuses on sufficiently mining the intrinsic features of individual image patches and the relations between image patch features. Based on this, we construct a Relational Representation Learning Network (RRL-Net). Specifically, we innovatively construct an autoencoder to fully characterize the individual intrinsic features, and introduce a feature interaction learning (FIL) module to extract deep-level feature relations. To further fully mine individual intrinsic features, a lightweight multi-dimensional global-to-local attention (MGLA) module is constructed to enhance the global feature extraction of individual image patches and capture local dependencies within global features. By combining the MGLA module, we further explore the feature extraction network and construct an attention-based lightweight feature extraction (ALFE) network. In addition, we propose a multi-loss post-pruning (MLPP) optimization strategy, which greatly promotes network optimization while avoiding increases in parameters and inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RRL-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets. Our code are available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/RRL-Net.

Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit.
  We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods. A link to our code can be found at https://github.com/daniel4725/HyperFusion

Abstract: Online construction of open-ended language scenes is crucial for robotic applications, where open-vocabulary interactive scene understanding is required. Recently, neural implicit representation has provided a promising direction for online interactive mapping. However, implementing open-vocabulary scene understanding capability into online neural implicit mapping still faces three challenges: lack of local scene updating ability, blurry spatial hierarchical semantic segmentation and difficulty in maintaining multi-view consistency. To this end, we proposed O2V-mapping, which utilizes voxel-based language and geometric features to create an open-vocabulary field, thus allowing for local updates during online training process. Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features. For the purpose of preserving consistency in 3D object properties across different viewpoints, we propose a spatial adaptive voxel adjustment mechanism and a multi-view weight selection method. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that O2V-mapping achieves online construction of language scenes while enhancing accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA method.

Abstract: Previous research on scanpath prediction has mainly focused on group models, disregarding the fact that the scanpaths and attentional behaviors of individuals are diverse. The disregard of these differences is especially detrimental to social human-robot interaction, whereby robots commonly emulate human gaze based on heuristics or predefined patterns. However, human gaze patterns are heterogeneous and varying behaviors can significantly affect the outcomes of such human-robot interactions. To fill this gap, we developed a deep learning-based social cue integration model for saliency prediction to instead predict scanpaths in videos. Our model learned scanpaths by recursively integrating fixation history and social cues through a gating mechanism and sequential attention. We evaluated our approach on gaze datasets of dynamic social scenes, observed under the free-viewing condition. The introduction of fixation history into our models makes it possible to train a single unified model rather than the resource-intensive approach of training individual models for each set of scanpaths. We observed that the late neural integration approach surpasses early fusion when training models on a large dataset, in comparison to a smaller dataset with a similar distribution. Results also indicate that a single unified model, trained on all the observers' scanpaths, performs on par or better than individually trained models. We hypothesize that this outcome is a result of the group saliency representations instilling universal attention in the model, while the supervisory signal and fixation history guide it to learn personalized attentional behaviors, providing the unified model a benefit over individual models due to its implicit representation of universal attention.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing a 3D scene including explicit geometry information is both attractive and challenging. Geometry reconstruction can benefit from incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods encounter efficiency issues due to indirect geometry learning and the paradigm of separately modeling geometry and surface appearance. In this work, we propose a learnable scene model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of 3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective information pathway to supervise the learning of both 3DGS and mesh. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only improves efficiency and rendering quality but also enables manipulation via the explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model that instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Removing reflection from a single image is challenging due to the absence of general reflection priors. Although existing methods incorporate extensive user guidance for satisfactory performance, they often lack the flexibility to adapt user guidance in different modalities, and dense user interactions further limit their practicality. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents FIRM, a novel framework for Flexible Interactive image Reflection reMoval with various forms of guidance, where users can provide sparse visual guidance (e.g., points, boxes, or strokes) or text descriptions for better reflection removal. Firstly, we design a novel user guidance conversion module (UGC) to transform different forms of guidance into unified contrastive masks. The contrastive masks provide explicit cues for identifying reflection and transmission layers in blended images. Secondly, we devise a contrastive mask-guided reflection removal network that comprises a newly proposed contrastive guidance interaction block (CGIB). This block leverages a unique cross-attention mechanism that merges contrastive masks with image features, allowing for precise layer separation. The proposed framework requires only 10\% of the guidance time needed by previous interactive methods, which makes a step-change in flexibility. Extensive results on public real-world reflection removal datasets validate that our method demonstrates state-of-the-art reflection removal performance. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/ShawnChenn/FlexibleReflectionRemoval.

<title>Improving Gaussian Splatting with Localized Points Management</title>

Abstract: Point management is critical for optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting models, as point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is often distributionally inappropriate. Typically, Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is adopted, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. We reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) due to inability of identifying all 3D zones requiring point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (e.g., occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in greatest need for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, subject to image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zones and then reset the opacity of the points in front of these regions, creating a new opportunity to correct poorly conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing static 3D and dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting models with minimal additional cost. Experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our LPM in boosting a variety of existing 3D/4D models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, LPM improves both static 3DGS and dynamic SpaceTimeGS to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality while retaining real-time speeds, excelling on challenging datasets such as Tanks & Temples and the Neural 3D Video dataset.

<title>A DeNoising FPN With Transformer R-CNN for Tiny Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in the field of computer vision, the precise detection of tiny objects continues to pose a significant challenge, largely owing to the minuscule pixel representation allocated to these objects in imagery data. This challenge resonates profoundly in the domain of geoscience and remote sensing, where high-fidelity detection of tiny objects can facilitate a myriad of applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, DeNoising FPN with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), to improve the performance of tiny object detection. DNTR consists of an easy plug-in design, DeNoising FPN (DN-FPN), and an effective Transformer-based detector, Trans R-CNN. Specifically, feature fusion in the feature pyramid network is important for detecting multiscale objects. However, noisy features may be produced during the fusion process since there is no regularization between the features of different scales. Therefore, we introduce a DN-FPN module that utilizes contrastive learning to suppress noise in each level's features in the top-down path of FPN. Second, based on the two-stage framework, we replace the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention. Experimental results manifest that our DNTR outperforms the baselines by at least 17.4% in terms of APvt on the AI-TOD dataset and 9.6% in terms of AP on the VisDrone dataset, respectively. Our code will be available at https://github.com/hoiliu-0801/DNTR.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the task of learning 3D human Gaussians from a single image, focusing on recovering detailed appearance and geometry including unobserved regions. We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images.

Abstract: Recent studies construct deblurred neural radiance fields~(DeRF) using dozens of blurry images, which are not practical scenarios if only a limited number of blurry images are available. This paper focuses on constructing DeRF from sparse-view for more pragmatic real-world scenarios. As observed in our experiments, establishing DeRF from sparse views proves to be a more challenging problem due to the inherent complexity arising from the simultaneous optimization of blur kernels and NeRF from sparse view. Sparse-DeRF successfully regularizes the complicated joint optimization, presenting alleviated overfitting artifacts and enhanced quality on radiance fields. The regularization consists of three key components: Surface smoothness, helps the model accurately predict the scene structure utilizing unseen and additional hidden rays derived from the blur kernel based on statistical tendencies of real-world; Modulated gradient scaling, helps the model adjust the amount of the backpropagated gradient according to the arrangements of scene objects; Perceptual distillation improves the perceptual quality by overcoming the ill-posed multi-view inconsistency of image deblurring and distilling the pre-deblurred information, compensating for the lack of clean information in blurry images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sparse-DeRF with extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results by training DeRF from 2-view, 4-view, and 6-view blurry images.

Abstract: We present 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis (NVS), supporting generation with arbitrary camera trajectories and timestamps, in natural scenes, conditioned on one or more images. With a novel architecture and sampling procedure, we enable training on a mixture of 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data, which greatly improves generalization to unseen images and camera pose trajectories over prior works that focus on limited domains (e.g., object centric). 4DiM is the first-ever NVS method with intuitive metric-scale camera pose control enabled by our novel calibration pipeline for structure-from-motion-posed data. Experiments demonstrate that 4DiM outperforms prior 3D NVS models both in terms of image fidelity and pose alignment, while also enabling the generation of scene dynamics. 4DiM provides a general framework for a variety of tasks including single-image-to-3D, two-image-to-video (interpolation and extrapolation), and pose-conditioned video-to-video translation, which we illustrate qualitatively on a variety of scenes.

Abstract: We show that many perception tasks, from visual recognition, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation to vocalization discrimination, are highly redundant functions of their input data. Images or spectrograms, projected into different subspaces, formed by orthogonal bases in pixel, Fourier or wavelet domains, can be used to solve these tasks remarkably well regardless of whether it is the top subspace where data varies the most, some intermediate subspace with moderate variability--or the bottom subspace where data varies the least. This phenomenon occurs because different subspaces have a large degree of redundant information relevant to the task.

Abstract: Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, blending two or more images to generate strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo supervision. Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined fixed rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones. The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency regularization. This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training? To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner. Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize. We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that the proposed frameworks can achieve superior performance. For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice similarity coefficient and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven significant progress in learning from single-subject, iconic images. However, there are still unanswered questions about the use of minimally-curated, naturalistic video data, which contain dense scenes with many independent objects, imbalanced class distributions, and varying object sizes. In this paper, we propose PooDLe, a self-supervised learning method that combines an invariance-based objective on pooled representations with a dense SSL objective that enforces equivariance to optical flow warping. Our results show that a unified objective applied at multiple feature scales is essential for learning effective image representations from naturalistic videos. We validate our method with experiments on the BDD100K driving video dataset and the Walking Tours first-person video dataset, demonstrating its ability to capture spatial understanding from a dense objective and semantic understanding via a pooled representation objective.

Abstract: We introduce OmniRe, a comprehensive system for efficiently creating high-fidelity digital twins of dynamic real-world scenes from on-device logs. Recent methods using neural fields or Gaussian Splatting primarily focus on vehicles, hindering a holistic framework for all dynamic foregrounds demanded by downstream applications, e.g., the simulation of human behavior. OmniRe extends beyond vehicle modeling to enable accurate, full-length reconstruction of diverse dynamic objects in urban scenes. Our approach builds scene graphs on 3DGS and constructs multiple Gaussian representations in canonical spaces that model various dynamic actors, including vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and others. OmniRe allows holistically reconstructing any dynamic object in the scene, enabling advanced simulations (~60Hz) that include human-participated scenarios, such as pedestrian behavior simulation and human-vehicle interaction. This comprehensive simulation capability is unmatched by existing methods. Extensive evaluations on the Waymo dataset show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively by a large margin. We further extend our results to 5 additional popular driving datasets to demonstrate its generalizability on common urban scenes.

Abstract: In clinical practice, segmenting specific lesions based on the needs of physicians can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. However, conventional lesion segmentation models lack the flexibility to distinguish lesions according to specific requirements. Given the practical advantages of using text as guidance, we propose a novel model, Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor (LSMS), which segments target lesions in medical images based on given textual expressions. We define this as a new task termed Referring Lesion Segmentation (RLS). To address the lack of suitable benchmarks for RLS, we construct a vision-language medical dataset named Reference Hepatic Lesion Segmentation (RefHL-Seg). LSMS incorporates two key designs: (i) Scale-Aware Vision-Language attention module, which performs visual feature extraction and vision-language alignment in parallel. By leveraging diverse convolutional kernels, this module acquires rich visual representations and interacts closely with linguistic features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for precise object localization. (ii) Full-Scale Decoder, which globally models multi-modal features across multiple scales and captures complementary information between them to accurately delineate lesion boundaries. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function comprising both segmentation loss and vision-language contrastive loss to better optimize cross-modal learning. We validate the performance of LSMS on RLS as well as on conventional lesion segmentation tasks across multiple datasets. Our LSMS consistently achieves superior performance with significantly lower computational cost. Code and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image. Extensive experiments analyze specific design choices and demonstrate that Depth Pro outperforms prior work along multiple dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Multi-modal Guided Real-World Face Restoration (MGFR) technique designed to improve the quality of facial image restoration from low-quality inputs. Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 21,000 high-resolution facial images across 4800 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content, the future internet may be inundated with synthetic data, making the discrimination of authentic and credible multimodal data increasingly challenging. Synthetic data detection has thus garnered widespread attention, and the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in this task has attracted significant interest. LMMs can provide natural language explanations for their authenticity judgments, enhancing the explainability of synthetic content detection. Simultaneously, the task of distinguishing between real and synthetic data effectively tests the perception, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities of LMMs. In response, we introduce LOKI, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to detect synthetic data across multiple modalities. LOKI encompasses video, image, 3D, text, and audio modalities, comprising 18K carefully curated questions across 26 subcategories with clear difficulty levels. The benchmark includes coarse-grained judgment and multiple-choice questions, as well as fine-grained anomaly selection and explanation tasks, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of LMMs. We evaluated 22 open-source LMMs and 6 closed-source models on LOKI, highlighting their potential as synthetic data detectors and also revealing some limitations in the development of LMM capabilities.

Abstract: Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.

Abstract: Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

<title>Inference Optimal VLMs Need Fewer Visual Tokens and More Parameters</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks, driven by incorporating image representations into the token inputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the large number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input tokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms tailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of tokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of operating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored token reduction algorithms for such conditions.

Abstract: Understanding the traffic scenes and then generating high-definition (HD) maps present significant challenges in autonomous driving. In this paper, we defined a novel Traffic Topology Scene Graph, a unified scene graph explicitly modeling the lane, controlled and guided by different road signals (e.g., right turn), and topology relationships among them, which is always ignored by previous high-definition (HD) mapping methods. For the generation of T2SG, we propose TopoFormer, a novel one-stage Topology Scene Graph TransFormer with two newly designed layers. Specifically, TopoFormer incorporates a Lane Aggregation Layer (LAL) that leverages the geometric distance among the centerline of lanes to guide the aggregation of global information. Furthermore, we proposed a Counterfactual Intervention Layer (CIL) to model the reasonable road structure ( e.g., intersection, straight) among lanes under counterfactual intervention. Then the generated T2SG can provide a more accurate and explainable description of the topological structure in traffic scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that TopoFormer outperforms existing methods on the T2SG generation task, and the generated T2SG significantly enhances traffic topology reasoning in downstream tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 46.3 OLS on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark. We will release our source code and model.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to localize the image regions based on a textual query. Given the difficulty of large-scale data curation, we investigate how to effectively learn visual grounding under data-scarce settings in this paper. To address the data scarcity, we propose a novel framework, POBF (Paint Outside the Box and Filter). POBF synthesizes images by inpainting outside the box, tackling a label misalignment issue encountered in previous works. Furthermore, POBF leverages an innovative filtering scheme to select the most effective training data. This scheme combines a hardness score and an overfitting score, balanced by a penalty term. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that POBF consistently improves performance, achieving an average gain of 5.83\% over the real-data-only method and outperforming leading baselines by 2.29\%-3.85\% in accuracy. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of POBF across various generative models, training data sizes, and model architectures.

Abstract: While Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates efficient and high-quality scene rendering and small area surface extraction ability, it falls short in handling large-scale aerial image surface extraction tasks. To overcome this, we present ULSR-GS, a framework dedicated to high-fidelity surface extraction in ultra-large-scale scenes, addressing the limitations of existing GS-based mesh extraction methods. Specifically, we propose a point-to-photo partitioning approach combined with a multi-view optimal view matching principle to select the best training images for each sub-region. Additionally, during training, ULSR-GS employs a densification strategy based on multi-view geometric consistency to enhance surface extraction details. Experimental results demonstrate that ULSR-GS outperforms other state-of-the-art GS-based works on large-scale aerial photogrammetry benchmark datasets, significantly improving surface extraction accuracy in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) have emerged as a bio-inspired alternative to traditional cameras, offering advantages in power efficiency, temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$). These results demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to EBC object detection through principled adaptation of mainstream architectures, offering an efficient alternative with potential applications to other temporal visual domains.

Abstract: How well are unimodal vision and language models aligned? Although prior work have approached answering this question, their assessment methods do not directly translate to how these models are used in practical vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose a direct assessment method, inspired by linear probing, to assess vision-language alignment. We identify that the degree of alignment of the SSL vision models depends on their SSL training objective, and we find that the clustering quality of SSL representations has a stronger impact on alignment performance than their linear separability. Next, we introduce Swift Alignment of Image and Language (SAIL), a efficient transfer learning framework that aligns pretrained unimodal vision and language models for downstream vision-language tasks. Since SAIL leverages the strengths of pretrained unimodal models, it requires significantly fewer (6%) paired image-text data for the multimodal alignment compared to models like CLIP which are trained from scratch. SAIL training only requires a single A100 GPU, 5 hours of training and can accommodate a batch size up to 32,768. SAIL achieves 73.4% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet (vs. CLIP's 72.7%) and excels in zero-shot retrieval, complex reasoning, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, SAIL improves the language-compatibility of vision encoders that in turn enhance the performance of multimodal large language models.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Our project page and dataset is available https://3dsrbench.github.io.

<title>SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection</title>

Abstract: Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.

Abstract: This paper aims to tackle the problem of photorealistic view synthesis from vehicle sensor data. Recent advancements in neural scene representation have achieved notable success in rendering high-quality autonomous driving scenes, but the performance significantly degrades as the viewpoint deviates from the training trajectory. To mitigate this problem, we introduce StreetCrafter, a novel controllable video diffusion model that utilizes LiDAR point cloud renderings as pixel-level conditions, which fully exploits the generative prior for novel view synthesis, while preserving precise camera control. Moreover, the utilization of pixel-level LiDAR conditions allows us to make accurate pixel-level edits to target scenes. In addition, the generative prior of StreetCrafter can be effectively incorporated into dynamic scene representations to achieve real-time rendering. Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and PandaSet demonstrate that our model enables flexible control over viewpoint changes, enlarging the view synthesis regions for satisfying rendering, which outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: As a common image editing operation, image composition involves integrating foreground objects into background scenes. In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization performance on in-the-wild images.

Abstract: Most autonomous driving (AD) datasets incur substantial costs for collection and labeling, inevitably yielding a plethora of low-quality and redundant data instances, thereby compromising performance and efficiency. Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.

Abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) data encapsulates rich multi-dimensional information essential for Earth observation. Its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal continuity make it particularly well-suited for developing large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). These models serve as powerful feature extractors, leveraging extensive RS data for pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning in various geoscientific applications. However, existing VFMs in the RS domain often concentrate on specific image characteristics, neglecting the full season-aware potential of RS data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a novel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS information. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit the spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we employ unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity, incorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and introduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations effectively. By explicitly modeling the complex, season-dependent attributes of RS data, SeaMo enhances generalization, robustness, and adaptability across geoscientific tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate its superior performance, underscoring its potential as a foundational model for Earth observation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models have enabled cost-effective video-editing applications by leveraging pre-trained models, eliminating the need for resource-intensive training. However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced the field of computer vision by enabling machines to create and interpret visual data with unprecedented sophistication. This transformation builds upon a foundation of generative models to produce realistic images, videos, and 3D/4D content. Conventional generative models primarily focus on visual fidelity while often neglecting the physical plausibility of the generated content. This gap limits their effectiveness in applications that require adherence to real-world physical laws, such as robotics, autonomous systems, and scientific simulations. As generative models evolve to increasingly integrate physical realism and dynamic simulation, their potential to function as "world simulators" expands. Therefore, the field of physics-aware generation in computer vision is rapidly growing, calling for a comprehensive survey to provide a structured analysis of current efforts. To serve this purpose, the survey presents a systematic review, categorizing methods based on how they incorporate physical knowledge, either through explicit simulation or implicit learning. It also analyzes key paradigms, discusses evaluation protocols, and identifies future research directions. By offering a comprehensive overview, this survey aims to help future developments in physically grounded generation for computer vision.

Abstract: The interest in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for surgical procedures to automate analysis has witnessed a significant surge in recent years. One of the primary tools for recording surgical procedures and conducting subsequent analyses, such as performance assessment, is through videos. However, these operative videos tend to be notably lengthy compared to other fields, spanning from thirty minutes to several hours, which poses a challenge for AI models to effectively learn from them. Despite this challenge, the foreseeable increase in the volume of such videos in the near future necessitates the development and implementation of innovative techniques to tackle this issue effectively. In this article, we propose a novel technique called Kinematics Adaptive Frame Recognition (KAFR) that can efficiently eliminate redundant frames to reduce dataset size and computation time while retaining useful frames to improve accuracy. Specifically, we compute the similarity between consecutive frames by tracking the movement of surgical tools. Our approach follows these steps: $i)$ Tracking phase: a YOLOv8 model is utilized to detect tools presented in the scene, $ii)$ Similarity phase: Similarities between consecutive frames are computed by estimating variation in the spatial positions and velocities of the tools, $iii$) Classification phase: An X3D CNN is trained to classify segmentation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing datasets obtained through retrospective reviews of cases at two referral centers. The newly annotated Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) dataset covers procedures performed between 2017 and 2021, while the previously annotated Pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) dataset spans from 2011 to 2022 at the same centers.

Abstract: Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information.
  In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured in poorly lit conditions, which often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, noise, and color distortions. These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the image.Through extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.Code is available here: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN

<title>DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions</title>

Abstract: Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 45% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.

Abstract: Deep learning based person re-identification (re-id) models have been widely employed in surveillance systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%, 49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the cognitive processes underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception with abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images? Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework using Bongard Problems (BPs) - a classic test of visual abstraction to dissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct evaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual Rule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule extraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical decomposition via textual descriptions). These paradigms allow us to systematically vary the cognitive load and probe specific processing stages. Notably, the CA paradigm enables the evaluation of multi-image reasoning even in VLMs architecturally limited to single images and facilitates the isolation of reasoning capabilities from perceptual limitations by controlling the descriptive input. Ablation studies further confirm that reasoning abilities improve significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated. Our framework provides a valuable diagnostic tool, highlighting the need to enhance visual processing fidelity for achieving more robust and human-like visual intelligence in AI.

Abstract: Today's image generation systems are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review. We will make open source our full dataset and code.

Abstract: The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent decades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes are susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant seems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two prevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these diseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal solution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders. Here, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine learning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed method comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed using a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3) feature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4) classification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550 features.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene inpainting is crucial for applications from virtual reality to architectural visualization, yet existing methods struggle with view consistency and geometric accuracy in 360{\deg} unbounded scenes. We present AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based method that enables high-quality object removal and hole filling in 3D scenes represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces (1) depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, (2) Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion, a zero-shot method for accurate initial point placement without requiring additional training, and (3) SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence. We also introduce 360-USID, the first comprehensive dataset for 360{\deg} unbounded scene inpainting with ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuraFusion360 significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior perceptual quality while maintaining geometric accuracy across dramatic viewpoint changes.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) represents a critical and challenging subtask within the general VQA domain. Despite significant advancements in general Visual Question Answering (VQA), multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still exhibit substantial limitations when handling multi-task VQA scenarios. These limitations manifest through erroneous spatial localization and misinterpretation of medical images, which primarily arise from two fundamental issues: inadequate image-text alignment and insufficient medical knowledge in general-purpose MLLMs for specialized medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce the Cross-Modal Clinical Knowledge Distiller (ClinKD), an innovative framework designed to enhance image-text alignment and establish more effective medical knowledge adaptation mechanisms, which enables MLLMs to adapt to medical knowledge. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the ClinKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Med-GRIT-270k dataset, a challenging medical benchmark containing fine-grained multi-task QA pairs. The results indicate that our approach not only significantly improves image-text alignment but also effectively enables MLLMs to adapt to the medical knowledge.

<title>Activation-wise Propagation: A Universal Strategy to Break Timestep Constraints in Spiking Neural Networks for 3D Data Processing</title>

Abstract: Due to their event-driven and parameter-efficient effect, spiking neural networks (SNNs) show potential in tasks requiring real-time multi-sensor perception, such as autonomous driving. The spiking mechanism facilitates sparse encoding, enabling spatial and temporal data to be represented in a discrete manner. However, SNNs still lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. One major challenge in SNNs is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal states, which makes it difficult to achieve an optimal trade-off among accuracy, latency, and training cost. Although some methods perform well with shorter timesteps, few propose strategies to overcome such constraint effectively. Moreover, many recent SNN advancements rely on either optimizations tailored to specific architectures or a collection of specialized neuron-level strategies. While these approaches can enhance performance, they often lead to increased computational expense and restrict their application to particular architectures or modalities. This leaves room for further exploration of simple, universal, and structure-agnostic strategies that could offer broader applicability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a novel state update mechanism for spiking neurons. Inspired by skip connections in deep networks, AMP2 incorporates the membrane potential of neurons into network, eliminating the need for iterative updates. Our method achieves significant improvements across various 3D modalities, including 3D point clouds and event streams, boosting Spiking PointNet's accuracy on ModelNet40 from 87.36% to 89.74% and surpassing ANN PointNet in recognition accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset.

Abstract: The vascular structure in retinal images plays a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnostics, and its accuracies are directly influenced by the quality of the retinal image. Contrast enhancement is one of the crucial steps in any segmentation algorithm - the more so since the retinal images are related to medical diagnosis. Contrast enhancement is a vital step that not only intensifies the darkness of the blood vessels but also prevents minor capillaries from being disregarded during the process. This paper proposes a novel model that utilizes the linear blending of Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement (FCE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the retinal image for retinal vascular structure segmentation. The scheme is tested using the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) dataset. The assertion was then evaluated through performance comparison among other methodologies which are Gray-scaling, Histogram Equalization (HE), FCE, and CLAHE. It was evident in this paper that the combination of FCE and CLAHE methods showed major improvement. Both FCE and CLAHE methods dominating with 88% as better enhancement methods proved that preprocessing through fuzzy logic is effective.

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot monocular depth estimation(MDE) have significantly improved generalization by unifying depth distributions through normalized depth representations and by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data via pseudo-label distillation. However, existing methods that rely on global depth normalization treat all depth values equally, which can amplify noise in pseudo-labels and reduce distillation effectiveness. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of depth normalization strategies in the context of pseudo-label distillation. Our study shows that, under recent distillation paradigms (e.g., shared-context distillation), normalization is not always necessary, as omitting it can help mitigate the impact of noisy supervision. Furthermore, rather than focusing solely on how depth information is represented, we propose Cross-Context Distillation, which integrates both global and local depth cues to enhance pseudo-label quality. We also introduce an assistant-guided distillation strategy that incorporates complementary depth priors from a diffusion-based teacher model, enhancing supervision diversity and robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), current approaches predominantly emphasize feature extraction and cross-modal comprehension, with limited attention to generating or transforming visual content. This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing animatable and high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular videos, especially with realistic relighting, is a valuable task. However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.

Abstract: Pixel grounding, encompassing tasks such as Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), has garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential for bridging the gap between vision and language modalities. However, advancements in this domain are currently constrained by limitations inherent in existing datasets, including limited object categories, insufficient textual diversity, and a scarcity of high-quality annotations. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce GroundingSuite, which comprises: (1) an automated data annotation framework leveraging multiple Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents; (2) a large-scale training dataset encompassing 9.56 million diverse referring expressions and their corresponding segmentations; and (3) a meticulously curated evaluation benchmark consisting of 3,800 images. The GroundingSuite training dataset facilitates substantial performance improvements, enabling models trained on it to achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, a cIoU of 68.9 on gRefCOCO and a gIoU of 55.3 on RefCOCOm. Moreover, the GroundingSuite annotation framework demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the current leading data annotation method, i.e., $4.5 \times$ faster than the GLaMM.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has shown impressive zero-shot performance on image classification. However, state-of-the-art methods often rely on fine-tuning techniques like prompt learning and adapter-based tuning to optimize CLIP's performance. The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training. Our approaches involve prompting the LMM to identify objects within an image. Subsequently, the CLIP text encoder determines the image class by identifying the dataset class with the highest semantic similarity to the LLM predicted object. Our models achieved superior accuracy on 9 of 11 base-to-novel datasets, including ImageNet, SUN397, and Caltech101, while maintaining a strictly training-free paradigm. Our TLAC model achieved an overall accuracy of 83.44%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art few-shot methods by a margin of 6.75%. Compared to other training-free approaches, our TLAC method achieved 83.6% average accuracy across 13 datasets, a 9.7% improvement over the previous methods.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) reveals the spatial distribution of gene expression in tissues, offering critical insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. However, the high cost, limited coverage, and technical complexity of current ST technologies restrict their widespread use in clinical and research settings, making obtaining high-resolution transcriptomic profiles across large tissue areas challenging. Predicting ST from H\&amp;E-stained histology images has emerged as a promising alternative to address these limitations but remains challenging due to the heterogeneous relationship between histomorphology and gene expression, which is affected by substantial variability across patients and tissue sections. In response, we propose PH2ST, a prompt-guided hypergraph learning framework, which leverages limited ST signals to guide multi-scale histological representation learning for accurate and robust spatial gene expression prediction. Extensive evaluations on two public ST datasets and multiple prompt sampling strategies simulating real-world scenarios demonstrate that PH2ST not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, but also shows strong potential for practical applications such as imputing missing spots, ST super-resolution, and local-to-global prediction, highlighting its value for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in biomedical contexts.

Abstract: The inherent ambiguity in defining visual concepts poses significant challenges for modern generative models, such as the diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) models, in accurately learning concepts from a single image. Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilises a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/ice

Abstract: Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have revolutionized generative modeling across different domains, from language processing to visual generation, demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, applying these advances to 3D generation presents three key challenges: the unordered nature of 3D data conflicts with sequential next-token prediction paradigm, conventional vector quantization approaches incur substantial compression loss when applied to 3D meshes, and the lack of efficient scaling strategies for higher resolution latent prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce MAR-3D, which integrates a pyramid variational autoencoder with a cascaded masked auto-regressive transformer (Cascaded MAR) for progressive latent upscaling in the continuous space. Our architecture employs random masking during training and auto-regressive denoising in random order during inference, naturally accommodating the unordered property of 3D latent tokens. Additionally, we propose a cascaded training strategy with condition augmentation that enables efficiently up-scale the latent token resolution with fast convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR-3D not only achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods but also exhibits enhanced scaling capabilities compared to joint distribution modeling approaches (e.g., diffusion transformers).

Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, alongside a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (0.635) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (0.102) or Proto-Elamite (0.078).
  Contrary to expectations, when measured through direct script-to-script embedding comparisons, the Indus script maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts with a mean cosine similarity of 0.930 (CI: [0.917, 0.942]) than to contemporaneous West Asian signaries, which recorded mean similarities of 0.887 (CI: [0.863, 0.911]) and 0.855 (CI: [0.818, 0.891]). Across dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts.
  These computational findings align with observed pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and iconographic elements. Archaeological evidence of contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road, coinciding with the Indus Civilization's decline, provides a plausible transmission pathway. While alternate explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of similarities suggest more complex cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.

Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

<title>Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration</title>

Abstract: The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .

Abstract: While recent image-based human animation methods achieve realistic body and facial motion synthesis, critical gaps remain in fine-grained holistic controllability, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence, which leads to their lower expressiveness and robustness. We propose a diffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid guidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control signals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D body skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements, while producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale adaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from portraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using data with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate motion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references, ensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex movements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits, upper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-view action recognition is a rapidly growing field in computer vision, offering significant potential for applications in surveillance. However, current datasets often fail to address real-world challenges such as wide-area distributed settings, asynchronous data streams, and the lack of frame-level annotations. Furthermore, existing methods face difficulties in effectively modeling inter-view relationships and enhancing spatial feature learning. In this paper, we introduce the MultiSensor-Home dataset, a novel benchmark designed for comprehensive action recognition in home environments, and also propose the Multi-modal Multi-view Transformer-based Sensor Fusion (MultiTSF) method. The proposed MultiSensor-Home dataset features untrimmed videos captured by distributed sensors, providing high-resolution RGB and audio data along with detailed multi-view frame-level action labels. The proposed MultiTSF method leverages a Transformer-based fusion mechanism to dynamically model inter-view relationships. Furthermore, the proposed method integrates a human detection module to enhance spatial feature learning, guiding the model to prioritize frames with human activity to enhance action the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the proposed MultiSensor-Home and the existing MM-Office datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiTSF over the state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing real-world multi-modal multi-view action recognition.

Abstract: Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

Abstract: We introduce the S-EO dataset: a large-scale, high-resolution dataset, designed to advance geometry-aware shadow detection. Collected from diverse public-domain sources, including challenge datasets and government providers such as USGS, our dataset comprises 702 georeferenced tiles across the USA, each covering 500x500 m. Each tile includes multi-date, multi-angle WorldView-3 pansharpened RGB images, panchromatic images, and a ground-truth DSM of the area obtained from LiDAR scans. For each image, we provide a shadow mask derived from geometry and sun position, a vegetation mask based on the NDVI index, and a bundle-adjusted RPC model. With approximately 20,000 images, the S-EO dataset establishes a new public resource for shadow detection in remote sensing imagery and its applications to 3D reconstruction. To demonstrate the dataset's impact, we train and evaluate a shadow detector, showcasing its ability to generalize, even to aerial images. Finally, we extend EO-NeRF - a state-of-the-art NeRF approach for satellite imagery - to leverage our shadow predictions for improved 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.

Abstract: We introduce FUSION, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a fully vision-language alignment and integration paradigm. Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during LLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the entire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens. Our ablation studies show that FUSION outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on over half of the benchmarks under same configuration without dynamic resolution, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. We release our code, model weights, and dataset. https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models often struggle with multi-instance synthesis (MIS), where they must accurately depict multiple distinct instances in a single image based on complex prompts detailing individual features. Traditional MIS control methods for UNet architectures like SD v1.5/SDXL fail to adapt to DiT-based models like FLUX and SD v3.5, which rely on integrated attention between image and text tokens rather than text-image cross-attention. To enhance MIS in DiT, we first analyze the mixed attention mechanism in DiT. Our token-wise and layer-wise analysis of attention maps reveals a hierarchical response structure: instance tokens dominate early layers, background tokens in middle layers, and attribute tokens in later layers. Building on this observation, we propose a training-free approach for enhancing MIS in DiT-based models with hierarchical and step-layer-wise attention specialty tuning (AST). AST amplifies key regions while suppressing irrelevant areas in distinct attention maps across layers and steps, guided by the hierarchical structure. This optimizes multimodal interactions by hierarchically decoupling the complex prompts with instance-based sketches. We evaluate our approach using upgraded sketch-based layouts for the T2I-CompBench and customized complex scenes. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm our method enhances complex layout generation, ensuring precise instance placement and attribute representation in MIS.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) has been extensively utilized for preference alignment of text-to-image models. Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.

Abstract: We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.

Abstract: Wetlands constitute critical ecosystems that support both biodiversity and human well-being; however, they have experienced a significant decline since the 20th century. Back in the 1970s, researchers began to employ remote sensing technologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and variations of wetlands. Although some review articles summarized the development of this field, there is a lack of a thorough and in-depth understanding of wetland classification and mapping: (1) the scientific importance of wetlands, (2) major data, methods used in wetland classification and mapping, (3) driving factors of wetland changes, (4) current research paradigm and limitations, (5) challenges and opportunities in wetland classification and mapping under the context of technological innovation and global environmental change. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective and new insights into wetland classification and mapping for readers to answer these questions. First, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 1,200 papers, encompassing wetland types, methods, sensor types, and study sites, examining prevailing trends in wetland classification and mapping. Next, we review and synthesize the wetland features and existing data and methods in wetland classification and mapping. We also summarize typical wetland mapping products and explore the intrinsic driving factors of wetland changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss current limitations and propose future directions in response to global environmental change and technological innovation. This review consolidates our understanding of wetland remote sensing and offers scientific recommendations that foster transformative progress in wetland science.

<title>An Efficient and Mixed Heterogeneous Model for Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Image restoration~(IR), as a fundamental multimedia data processing task, has a significant impact on downstream visual applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Abstract: As interpretability gains attention in machine learning, there is a growing need for reliable models that fully explain representation content. We propose a mutual information (MI)-based method that decomposes neural network representations into three exhaustive components: total mutual information, decision-related information, and redundant information. This theoretically complete framework captures the entire input-representation relationship, surpassing partial explanations like those from Grad-CAM. Using two lightweight modules integrated into architectures such as CNNs and Transformers,we estimate these components and demonstrate their interpretive power through visualizations on ResNet and prototype network applied to image classification and few-shot learning tasks. Our approach is distinguished by three key features: 1. Rooted in mutual information theory, it delivers a thorough and theoretically grounded interpretation, surpassing the scope of existing interpretability methods. 2. Unlike conventional methods that focus on explaining decisions, our approach centers on interpreting representations. 3. It seamlessly integrates into pre-existing network architectures, requiring only fine-tuning of the inserted modules.

Abstract: Higher order artificial neurons whose outputs are computed by applying an activation function to a higher order multinomial function of the inputs have been considered in the past, but did not gain acceptance due to the extra parameters and computational cost. However, higher order neurons have significantly greater learning capabilities since the decision boundaries of higher order neurons can be complex surfaces instead of just hyperplanes. The boundary of a single quadratic neuron can be a general hyper-quadric surface allowing it to learn many nonlinearly separable datasets. Since quadratic forms can be represented by symmetric matrices, only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ additional parameters are needed instead of $n^2$. A quadratic Logistic regression model is first presented. Solutions to the XOR problem with a single quadratic neuron are considered. The complete vectorized equations for both forward and backward propagation in feedforward networks composed of quadratic neurons are derived. A reduced parameter quadratic neural network model with just $ n $ additional parameters per neuron that provides a compromise between learning ability and computational cost is presented. Comparison on benchmark classification datasets are used to demonstrate that a final layer of quadratic neurons enables networks to achieve higher accuracy with significantly fewer hidden layer neurons. In particular this paper shows that any dataset composed of $\mathcal{C}$ bounded clusters can be separated with only a single layer of $\mathcal{C}$ quadratic neurons.

<title>Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks</title>

Abstract: The vast majority of standard image and video content available online is represented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values are conveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution is approximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.

Abstract: Previous foundation models for fundus images were pre-trained with limited disease categories and knowledge base. Here we introduce a knowledge-rich vision-language model (RetiZero) that leverages knowledge from more than 400 fundus diseases. For RetiZero's pretraining, we compiled 341,896 fundus images paired with texts, sourced from public datasets, ophthalmic literature, and online resources, encompassing a diverse range of diseases across multiple ethnicities and countries. RetiZero exhibits remarkable performance in several downstream tasks, including zero-shot disease recognition, image-to-image retrieval, AI-assisted clinical diagnosis,few-shot fine-tuning, and internal- and cross-domain disease identification. In zero-shot scenarios, RetiZero achieves Top-5 accuracies of 0.843 for 15 diseases and 0.756 for 52 diseases. For image retrieval, it achieves Top-5 scores of 0.950 and 0.886 for the same sets, respectively. AI-assisted clinical diagnosis results show that RetiZero's Top-3 zero-shot performance surpasses the average of 19 ophthalmologists from Singapore, China, and the United States. RetiZero substantially enhances clinicians' accuracy in diagnosing fundus diseases, in particularly rare ones. These findings underscore the value of integrating the RetiZero into clinical settings, where various fundus diseases are encountered.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this letter introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet they require extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs), which are critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Additionally, based on our exploration of TSD, we focus on an important issue in PEFT: the initialization of LoRA. While some works have pointed out the significance of initialization for LoRA's performance and proposed various strategies, these methods are often empirical and not task-specific. To address this issue, we propose LoRA-Init. Starting from TSD, we identify the directions that require the most adjustment during fine-tuning for downstream tasks. By initializing the matrices in LoRA with these directions, LoRA-Init significantly enhances LoRA's performance. Moreover, we can combine LoRA-Dash and LoRA-Init to create the final version of LoRA based on TSDs, which we refer to as LoRA-TSD. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms behind their success.

<title>SwinGS: Sliding Window Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Video Streaming with Arbitrary Length</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work and could be easily scaled to volumetric videos with arbitrary length with no increasing of required GPU resources.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful image transformations (i.e. rotation, thickness, blur) directly from examples can be a challenging task. Recently, the Manifold Autoencoder (MAE) proposed using a set of Lie group operators to learn image transformations directly from examples. However, this approach has limitations, as the learned operators are not guaranteed to be disentangled and the training routine is prohibitively expensive when scaling up the model. To address these limitations, we propose MANGO (transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators) for learning disentangled operators that describe image transformations in distinct latent subspaces. Moreover, our approach allows practitioners the ability to define which transformations they aim to model, thus improving the semantic meaning of the learned operators. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that MANGO enables composition of image transformations and introduces a one-phase training routine that leads to a 100x speedup over prior works.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based approaches have demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, in automatic programming, a single LLM is typically limited to function-level code generation, while multi-agent systems composed of multiple LLMs often suffer from inefficient task planning. This lack of structured coordination can lead to cascading hallucinations, where accumulated errors across agents result in suboptimal workflows and excessive computational costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MaCTG (Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph), a novel multi-agent framework that employs a dynamic graph structure to facilitate precise task allocation and controlled collaboration among LLM agents. MaCTG autonomously assigns agent roles based on programming requirements, dynamically refines task distribution through context-aware adjustments, and systematically verifies and integrates project-level code, effectively reducing hallucination errors and improving overall accuracy. MaCTG enhances cost-effectiveness by implementing a hybrid LLM deployment, where proprietary models handle complex reasoning, while open-source models are used for routine coding and validation tasks. To evaluate MaCTG's effectiveness, we applied it to traditional image processing auto-programming tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.33%. Additionally, by leveraging its hybrid LLM configuration, MaCTG significantly reduced operational costs by 89.09% compared to existing multi-agent frameworks, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability.

<title>Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models</title>

Abstract: The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in open-world scenarios often encounter unfamiliar conditions and perform poorly in unanticipated situations. As AI systems advance and find application in safety-critical domains, effectively handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial to building open-world learning systems. In this work, we introduce ALOE, a novel active learning algorithm for open-world environments designed to enhance model adaptation by incorporating new OOD classes via a two-stage approach. First, diversity sampling selects a representative set of examples, followed by energy-based OOD detection to prioritize likely unknown classes for annotation. This strategy accelerates class discovery and learning, even under constrained annotation budgets. Evaluations on three long-tailed image classification benchmarks demonstrate that ALOE outperforms traditional active learning baselines, effectively expanding known categories while balancing annotation cost. Our findings reveal a crucial tradeoff between enhancing known-class performance and discovering new classes, setting the stage for future advancements in open-world machine learning.

Abstract: Accurately determining the shape of objects and the location of their internal structures within deformable objects is crucial for medical tasks that require precise targeting, such as robotic biopsies. We introduce LUDO, a method for accurate low-latency understanding of deformable objects. LUDO reconstructs objects in their deformed state, including their internal structures, from a single-view point cloud observation in under 30 ms using occupancy networks. LUDO provides uncertainty estimates for its predictions. Additionally, it provides explainability by highlighting key features in its input observations. Both uncertainty and explainability are important for safety-critical applications such as surgical interventions. We demonstrate LUDO's abilities for autonomous targeting of internal regions of interest (ROIs) in deformable objects. %Additionally, LUDO provides uncertainty estimates and explainability for its predictions, both of which are important in safety-critical applications such as surgical interventions. We evaluate LUDO in real-world robotic experiments, achieving a success rate of 98.9% for puncturing various ROIs inside deformable objects. LUDO demonstrates the potential to interact with deformable objects without the need for deformable registration methods.

Abstract: To examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Abstract: Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion (HMIF) aims to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) to reconstruct high spatial and high spectral resolution images. Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without effective supervision, leading to an incomplete perception of deep modality-complementary information and a limited understanding of inter-modality correlations. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective solution for unsupervised HMIF, revealing that modality decoupling is key to improving fusion performance. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised \textbf{Mo}dality-Decoupled \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{S}pectral Fusion (\textbf{MossFuse}) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of both LR-HSIs and HR-MSIs to reduce modality redundancy. Also, we introduce the subspace clustering loss as a clear guide to decouple modality-shared features from modality-complementary ones. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HMIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence systems. This study introduces CRF-GAN, a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture that enhances structural consistency in 3D medical image synthesis. Integrating Conditional Random Fields within a two-step generation process allows CRF-GAN improving spatial coherence while maintaining high-resolution image quality. The model's performance is evaluated against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: We evaluate the performance of CRF-GAN against the HA-GAN model. The comparison between the two models was made through a quantitative evaluation, using FID and MMD metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID and MMD scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. The key objective was not only to lower the computational cost but also to reallocate the freed-up resources towards the creation of higher-resolution 3D imaging, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability. Moreover, unlike many previous studies, we combined qualitative and quantitative assessments to obtain a more holistic feedback on the model's performance.

Abstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-conditioned Video Generation Models (VGMs), the quality of generated videos has significantly improved, bringing these models closer to functioning as ``*world simulators*'' and making real-world-level video generation more accessible and cost-effective. However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often struggle with two major challenges: distribution shift and label noise. Models tend to overfit by focusing on redundant and uninformative features in the training data, which makes it hard for them to generalize to the target domain. Noisy data worsens this problem by causing further overfitting to the noise, meaning that existing methods often fail to tell the difference between true, invariant features and misleading, spurious ones. To tackle these issues, we introduce Anchor Alignment and Adaptive Weighting (A3W). This new algorithm uses sample reweighting guided by natural language processing (NLP) anchors to extract more representative features. In simple terms, A3W leverages semantic representations from natural language models as a source of domain-invariant prior knowledge. Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts each sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP anchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that A3W consistently outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels.

<title>Reason2Attack: Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models via LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Text-to-Image(T2I) models typically deploy safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design prompts for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.

Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/unlearn/tree/main/semeval25.

Abstract: We propose a score-based generative algorithm for sampling from power-scaled priors and likelihoods within the Bayesian inference framework. Our algorithm enables flexible control over prior-likelihood influence without requiring retraining for different power-scaling configurations. Specifically, we focus on synthesizing seismic velocity models conditioned on imaged seismic. Our method enables sensitivity analysis by sampling from intermediate power posteriors, allowing us to assess the relative influence of the prior and likelihood on samples of the posterior distribution. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the effects of varying the power parameter in different settings: applying it solely to the prior, to the likelihood of a Bayesian formulation, and to both simultaneously. The results show that increasing the power of the likelihood up to a certain threshold improves the fidelity of posterior samples to the conditioning data (e.g., seismic images), while decreasing the prior power promotes greater structural diversity among samples. Moreover, we find that moderate scaling of the likelihood leads to a reduced shot data residual, confirming its utility in posterior refinement.

<div> Keywords: lossy compression, rate-distortion-perception function, rate-distortion-classification function, universal encoder, image compression

Summary:
In the field of lossy compression, traditional algorithms balance compression rate and reconstruction distortion. However, a recent framework, the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, considers perceptual quality in addition to the classical tradeoff. The rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function, introduced in a study, evaluates compression performance based on classification accuracy alongside distortion. This paper explores the concept of universal representations, where a single encoder is designed to achieve multiple decoding objectives across various distortion and classification constraints. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset show that a universal encoder performs almost as well as individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression tasks. Yet, in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for a specific classification-distortion tradeoff results in a significant distortion penalty when used for alternative points.<br /><br />Summary: In lossy compression, a new approach considers perceptual quality and classification accuracy alongside distortion. Universal encoders show promising results for image compression tasks, but caution is needed when reusing an encoder optimized for specific tradeoffs in the classification-distortion setting. <div>

Abstract: In lossy compression, the classical tradeoff between compression rate and reconstruction distortion has traditionally guided algorithm design. However, Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as an additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19], evaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy alongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations, where a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives across various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This universality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point within these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset indicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation compared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression tasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify that in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific classification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty when applied to alternative points.

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for road maintenance and safety monitoring.

This article presents a novel approach to integrating nonverbal cues into AI therapy to improve the management of client resistance in psychotherapy. By introducing the Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror) synthetic dataset, which combines client statements with corresponding facial images, the study trains Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses. The results indicate that the Mirror dataset significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, outperforming traditional text-based cognitive behavioral therapy models. This approach shows promise in improving the therapist's counseling skills and strengthening the therapeutic alliance, even in the face of client resistance. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.

<br />
Summary: 
Wavelet-VAE is introduced as a novel approach to improve image generation with VAEs by using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients in the latent space. The method encodes image features into multi-scale detail and approximation coefficients and incorporates a learnable noise parameter for stochasticity. The reparameterization trick is reformulated, and the KL divergence term is addressed to enhance training. Wavelet sparsity principles are integrated into the objective function. Experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and other datasets shows that Wavelet-VAE produces higher visual fidelity and recovers finer details than conventional VAEs. The approach offers advantages for generative modeling but may have limitations that need to be explored further. Future research directions may focus on enhancing wavelet-based generative modeling techniques.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models capable of learning compact latent representations. However, conventional VAEs often generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative modeling.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

<div> Style transfer, multi-subject, images, ICAS, diffusion model
<br />
Summary:
ICAS is a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject style transfer in images. It uses IP-Adapter and ControlNet for adaptive style injection and structural conditioning, respectively, which helps in preserving global layout and accurate style synthesis. The framework fine-tunes only the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, ensuring identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability. Additionally, ICAS introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism for effective style transfer without the need for extensive stylized data. Experimental results demonstrate that ICAS outperforms existing methods in structure preservation, style consistency, and inference efficiency, making it a promising approach for multi-subject style transfer in real-world applications.
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due to the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture, atmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them across multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject semantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention Structure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject style transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby preserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability. By combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for structural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout preservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables effective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for extensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves superior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and inference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style transfer in real-world applications.

Abstract: Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across 13 key themes. Evaluating both Vision Language Models and custom-trained classifiers, we show that while zero-shot prompting offers quick deployment, even simple trained models outperform them when labelled data is available, by up to 23%. Our findings highlight the enduring importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

arXiv:2504.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification remains a challenging task due to the intricate spatial-spectral correlations. Existing transformer models excel in capturing long-range dependencies but often suffer from information redundancy and attention inefficiencies, limiting their ability to model fine-grained relationships crucial for HSI classification. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced transformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature extraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic memory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral dependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further improve structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional encoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the computational burden of convolution-based approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MemFormer achieves superior classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2504.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored. In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning (fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+ significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a considerable margin.

Summary:
<br />
Monocular 3D object detection is crucial in computer vision, but requires costly 3D labeled data for training. This study introduces a weakly-supervised approach, Weak Cube R-CNN, that enables 3D object detection using only 2D box annotations. The method leverages pre-trained 2D models to estimate depth and orientation, using these estimates as pseudo-ground truths during training. By incorporating information from the 2D models into the loss functions, the model learns to predict 3D objects without explicit 3D annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset demonstrate improved accuracy compared to a baseline method with equivalent annotation effort. While not as precise as methods using 3D labels, the weakly-supervised approach shows potential for reducing data requirements in 3D object detection tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is an essential task in computer vision, and it has several applications in robotics and virtual reality. However, 3D object detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN, which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method provides a strong foundation for further research.

Abstract: Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise. Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2} ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3 or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark SAR datasets.

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Summary:
POET is an interactive tool designed to assist users in the early creative ideation stages by automatically discovering dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models. It then expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images and learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. The tool aims to provide users with novel and high-quality images that adhere to their specifications, assisting in creative exploration. An evaluation with 28 users across different creative task domains showed that POET generated results with higher perceived diversity and helped users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts. This enabled users to deliberate and reflect on a wider range of possible results during the co-creative process. By focusing on visual creativity, POET demonstrates how future text-to-image generation tools can support diverse user needs and values during the ideation stages of their work.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generative AI tools hold immense potential to assist users in the early ideation stages of creative tasks -- offering the ability to generate (rather than search for) novel and unprecedented (instead of existing) images of considerable quality that also adhere to boundless combinations of user specifications. However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.

Abstract: Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator, making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97\% accuracy at genus and 94\% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50\% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.

<div> Keywords: autonomous driving, hazard detection, vision-language reasoning, zero-shot object detection, anomaly detection

Summary:
Anomalies in visual data pose a significant challenge in autonomous driving, particularly in video streams. Existing models struggle with out-of-label hazards due to predefined object categories. A novel multimodal approach integrating vision-language reasoning and zero-shot object detection is proposed to enhance hazard identification. The pipeline includes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) for detecting hazardous objects in traffic scenes. OpenAI's CLIP model is integrated to refine object detection and improve localization accuracy. A ground truth dataset is created by extending the COOOL anomaly detection benchmark dataset with natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. Model performance is evaluated based on semantic similarity between predicted hazard descriptions and ground truth annotations using cosine similarity. Tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets are also released. The study sheds light on the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, providing insights for future enhancements in autonomous hazard detection systems. <div>

Abstract: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

<div> Cytology, cancer diagnostics, deep learning models, CytoFM, self-supervised foundation model <br />
<br />Summary: 
Cytology plays a crucial role in cancer diagnostics, but developing deep learning models for digital cytology faces challenges due to sample heterogeneity. The CytoFM model is introduced as the first cytology self-supervised foundation model, pre-trained on diverse cytology datasets using the iBOT framework. Evaluation on breast cancer classification and cell type identification tasks shows CytoFM outperforms existing foundation models. Visualizations indicate CytoFM attends to cytologically relevant features, showcasing its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations from cytology data despite a small pre-training dataset. <div>

Abstract: Cytology is essential for cancer diagnostics and screening due to its minimally invasive nature. However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.

<div> Keywords: Crowd Counting, Estimation, CLIP, Progressive Learning, Vision-Language Matching<br />
Summary: 

Rough Crowd Counting is proposed as a more feasible and accurate approach for estimating crowd sizes by using rough annotations instead of per-target annotations. The ProgRoCC method, based on CLIP, employs a progressive estimation learning strategy that delivers quick and superior results in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. A vision-language matching adapter is introduced to optimize key-value pairs and refine visual features through effective matches of two modalities. The approach outperforms existing methods on three popular crowd counting datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in accurately estimating crowd sizes in images.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: LoRA-based continual learning, Vision Transformer, orthogonal LoRA tuning, freezing critical parameters, orthogonal LoRA composition

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to enhance continual learning by combining LoRA-based methods with freezing critical parameters in Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The proposed method, named orthogonal LoRA composition (LoRAC), utilizes QR decomposition to improve plasticity and mitigate forgetting in pre-trained models. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, the effectiveness of the method is validated, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on various continual learning benchmarks. Specifically, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset, the method achieves a significant accuracy improvement of 6.35% and reduces forgetting by 3.24% compared to existing techniques. The code for the proposed method is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However, this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset, our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in forgetting compared to previous methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/learninginvision/LoRAC-IPC.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, Fourier feature encodings, multigrid parametric encodings, spectral bias, NTK 

Summary: 
Neural networks commonly used in computer graphics and scientific computing struggle to learn high frequency information due to spectral bias. Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE) are two techniques to mitigate this issue. While FFE is the standard, MPE often outperforms it by learning representations with higher resolution and finer detail. The analysis using the neural tangent kernel (NTK) shows that MPE improves performance through its grid structure, not just the learned embedding, unlike FFE. Empirical validation on image and 3D surface regression tasks demonstrates MPE's significant improvement in performance metrics such as PSNR and MS-SSIM. MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline, resulting in a substantial increase in image quality metrics compared to FFE and baseline methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in data-driven geometric multi-view 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R, have demonstrated exceptional performance in 3D vision tasks with the help of large-scale 3D datasets. However, existing models face challenges in areas with limited matching cues, like weakly textured regions and low-light conditions, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality. To address this, a monocular-guided refinement module is proposed to enhance multi-view reconstruction frameworks by integrating monocular geometric priors. This integration improves the robustness of reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality reconstructions. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, the method shows significant enhancements in multi-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven geometric multi-view 3D reconstruction foundation models (e.g., DUSt3R) have shown remarkable performance across various 3D vision tasks, facilitated by the release of large-scale, high-quality 3D datasets. However, as we observed, constrained by their matching-based principles, the reconstruction quality of existing models suffers significant degradation in challenging regions with limited matching cues, particularly in weakly textured areas and low-light conditions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose to harness the inherent robustness of monocular geometry estimation to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of matching-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a monocular-guided refinement module that integrates monocular geometric priors into multi-view reconstruction frameworks. This integration substantially enhances the robustness of multi-view reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality feed-forward reconstructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both mutli-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy.

arXiv:2504.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) aims to detect changes between bi-temporal remote sensing images by utilizing limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Existing methods struggle in complex scenarios, exhibiting poor performance when confronted with noisy data. They typically neglect intra-layer multi-scale features while emphasizing inter-layer fusion, harming the integrity of change objects with different scales. In this paper, we propose HSACNet, a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Consistency regularized Network for SSCD. Specifically, we integrate Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using its Hiera backbone as the encoder to extract inter-layer multi-scale features and applying adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a Scale-Aware Differential Attention Module (SADAM) that can precisely capture intra-layer multi-scale change features and suppress noise. Additionally, a dual-augmentation consistency regularization strategy is adopted to effectively utilize the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments across four CD benchmarks demonstrate that our HSACNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with reduced parameters and computational cost.

arXiv:2504.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of inhomogeneous media between optical sensors and objects leads to distorted imaging outputs, significantly complicating downstream image-processing tasks. A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations.The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.

Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is crucial for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery understanding. Current approaches face two challenges: (i) static image limitations including ambiguous local feature similarities and fine-grained structural details, and (ii) dynamic video complexities arising from rapid instrument motion and persistent visual occlusions. While existing methods mainly focus on spatial feature extraction, they fundamentally overlook temporal dependencies in surgical video streams. To address this, we present temporal asymmetric feature propagation network, a bidirectional attention architecture enabling cross-frame feature propagation. The proposed method contains a temporal query propagator that integrates multi-directional consistency constraints to enhance frame-specific feature representation, and an aggregated asymmetric feature pyramid module that preserves discriminative features for anatomical structures and surgical instruments. Our framework uniquely enables both temporal guidance and contextual reasoning for surgical scene understanding. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms the current SOTA methods by a large margin, with +16.4\% mIoU on EndoVis2018 and +3.3\% mAP on Endoscapes2023. The code will be publicly available after paper acceptance.

Quantitative remote sensing inversion is crucial for environmental monitoring by estimating ecological variables like vegetation indices and carbon stock. Existing vision foundation models focus on classification and segmentation, but their use in regression for remote sensing is limited. The multi-spectral and geospatial complexity of remote sensing data presents challenges for generalization. SatelliteCalculator is introduced as the first model designed for quantitative remote sensing inversion. It creates a dataset of over one million samples for eight ecological indicators, using physically defined index formulas. The model combines a Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, including cross-attentive adapters and task-specific decoders. Experimental results on the Open-Canopy benchmark show that SatelliteCalculator achieves accurate results with reduced inference cost, demonstrating the potential for foundation models in remote sensing estimation and providing a scalable framework for task-specific applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, enabling the estimation of key ecological variables such as vegetation indices, canopy structure, and carbon stock. Although vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders. Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.

<div> Keywords: ground displacement, deep learning, optical flow, sub-pixel precision, Total Variation regularization

Summary:
Ground displacement measurements are essential for geological studies but are challenging to collect directly. Traditional methods use optical satellite images and patch matching techniques for estimating displacement fields. However, deep learning-based optical flow models face challenges such as the lack of real ground truth and the need for sub-pixel precision. A novel deep learning model proposed in this study utilizes iterative refinement with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone to achieve sub-pixel precision. A non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization is also employed to preserve sharpness in fault lines while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. The model outperformed conventional geophysics methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and demonstrated good generalization to real-world scenarios captured by medium- and high-resolution sensors. This advancement addresses the limitations of existing methods and shows promise for improving ground deformation analysis in geological studies. 

Summary: <br /><br />Ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies and are traditionally estimated using optical satellite images. Deep learning models face challenges in achieving sub-pixel precision due to the absence of real ground truth and temporal variations. A novel model proposed in this study incorporates iterative refinements with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone for enhanced accuracy. Additionally, a non-convex Total Variation regularization maintains fault-line sharpness while ensuring smoothness elsewhere. The model outperforms conventional geophysics methods on benchmarks and demonstrates good performance in real-world scenarios with different sensor resolutions. This approach addresses key challenges in ground deformation analysis, offering significant advancements for geological studies. <div>

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising, their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular, we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead, we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision. Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by both medium- and high-resolution sensors.

<div> Keywords: event cameras, neural ganglion sensors, spatio-temporal features, video interpolation, optical flow

Summary: 
Neural Ganglion Sensors are introduced as an extension of traditional event cameras, inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye. These sensors learn task-specific spatio-temporal retinal kernels (RGC "events"), akin to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye. Unlike conventional event cameras, Neural Ganglion Sensors leverage local spatial context when deciding which events to fire. The study evaluates these sensors on video interpolation and optical flow tasks, showing improved performance compared to regular event cameras with reduced event bandwidth. This biologically inspired sensing approach offers promise for edge devices and other low-power, real-time applications that require efficient, high-resolution visual streams. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye, event cameras were created to achieve high temporal resolution with minimal power and bandwidth requirements by emitting asynchronous, per-pixel intensity changes rather than conventional fixed-frame rate images. Unlike retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from multiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal features, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when deciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different kinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or conditions. Inspired by this biological design, we introduce Neural Ganglion Sensors, an extension of traditional event cameras that learns task-specific spatio-temporal retinal kernels (i.e., RGC "events"). We evaluate our design on two challenging tasks: video interpolation and optical flow. Our results demonstrate that our biologically inspired sensing improves performance relative to conventional event cameras while reducing overall event bandwidth. These findings highlight the promise of RGC-inspired event sensors for edge devices and other low-power, real-time applications requiring efficient, high-resolution visual streams.

<div> Keywords: SAR image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, image resolution alignment, pseudo-labels, symmetric cross-entropy loss 

Summary: 
In the field of remote sensing, the segmentation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is challenging due to noise and lack of detailed information. Previous methods have used pseudo-labels generated from paired optical-SAR images, but these labels often contain noise leading to suboptimal results. A new method introduced in this study combines semi-supervised learning with image resolution alignment augmentation to generate more precise pseudo-labels. A symmetric cross-entropy loss function is also employed to reduce the impact of noisy labels. Additionally, a combination of training and testing techniques are used to improve land-cover mapping results. The proposed method achieved first place in the GRSS data fusion contest, showcasing its effectiveness in SAR image segmentation tasks. The code for the method is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of SAR images has garnered significant attention in remote sensing due to the immunity of SAR sensors to cloudy weather and light conditions. Nevertheless, SAR imagery lacks detailed information and is plagued by significant speckle noise, rendering the annotation or segmentation of SAR images a formidable task. Recent efforts have resorted to annotating paired optical-SAR images to generate pseudo-labels through the utilization of an optical image segmentation network. However, these pseudo-labels are laden with noise, leading to suboptimal performance in SAR image segmentation. In this study, we introduce a more precise method for generating pseudo-labels by incorporating semi-supervised learning alongside a novel image resolution alignment augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a symmetric cross-entropy loss to mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Additionally, a bag of training and testing tricks is utilized to generate better land-cover mapping results. Our experiments on the GRSS data fusion contest indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves first place. The code is available at https://github.com/StuLiu/DFC2025Track1.git.

<div> Keywords: few-shot learning, temporal action localization, textual information, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, human anomaly detection<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new few-shot temporal action localization method that incorporates textual information for improved performance. The proposed method utilizes Chain-of-Thought reasoning to leverage semantic information and enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations. A semantic-aware text-visual alignment module aligns query and support videos, while a Chain of Thought reasoning method guides the Vision Language Model and Large Language Model to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos, capturing more variance of action than visual features. The method is evaluated on ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets and a new dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization. Experimental results show significant improvements in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. The code, data, and benchmark will be released for further research. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

<div> diffusion models, image editing, seed selection, ELECT, background consistency<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces ELECT, a framework for seed selection in instruction-guided image editing using diffusion models. It aims to address editing failures by efficiently selecting seeds that maintain background consistency and modify foreground appropriately. By early estimation of background mismatches, ELECT ranks seed candidates based on background inconsistency scores, reducing computational costs and improving success rates in editing tasks. The framework integrates into editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models for joint seed and prompt selection, further enhancing results. Experimental results show significant improvements in background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases without any external supervision or training. <div>
arXiv:2504.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach for high-quality image generation, but their high computational cost still remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities. Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7 points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the research community while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are the earliest known form of Chinese characters and serve as a valuable resource for research in anthropology and archaeology. However, most excavated fragments are severely degraded due to thousands of years of natural weathering, corrosion, and man-made destruction, making automatic OBI recognition extremely challenging. Previous methods either focus on pixel-level information or utilize vanilla transformers for glyph-based OBI denoising, which leads to tremendous computational overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a fast attentive denoising framework for oracle bone inscriptions, i.e., OBIFormer. It leverages channel-wise self-attention, glyph extraction, and selective kernel feature fusion to reconstruct denoised images precisely while being computationally efficient. Our OBIFormer achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance for PSNR and SSIM metrics on synthetic and original OBI datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on a real oracle dataset demonstrate the great potential of our OBIFormer in assisting automatic OBI recognition. The code will be made available at https://github.com/LJHolyGround/OBIFormer.

Summary:
The paper addresses challenges in reconstructing 3D scenes from images, focusing on inaccuracies and blurriness in current methods utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The proposed framework, EG-Gaussian, integrates epipolar geometry and graph networks to enhance 3D scene reconstruction accuracy. By incorporating epipolar geometry in the initialization phase, the framework improves the accuracy of 3DGS point construction. Additionally, a graph learning module refines spatial features through spatial coordinates and angular relationships among points. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that EG-Gaussian outperforms existing 3DGS-based methods, producing more complete and accurate 3D scenes. This novel approach offers a promising solution to enhance 3D scene reconstruction quality in various indoor and outdoor scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an open research problem concerning the reconstruction of 3D scenes from images. Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.

<div> Keywords: model calibration, data augmentation, uncertainty, confidence scores, diffusion models

Summary:
Model calibration is essential to ensure accurate confidence scores for predictions, but existing approaches rely on datasets with one-hot labels, lacking information on uncertainty. To address this limitation, Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM) introduces synthetic datasets with diverse samples and ground-truth uncertainty using diffusion models. The framework generates mixed class characteristics and assigns distinct confidence scores to training samples. Calibrated reannotation is utilized to align annotated confidence scores with mixing ratios during the diffusion reverse process. In addition, CSM explores loss functions suitable for this new data representation paradigm. Experimental results show that CSM outperforms state-of-the-art calibration approaches in achieving superior calibration. The code for CSM is available on github.com/E-Galois/CSM. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM), a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at github.com/E-Galois/CSM.

To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the fidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents WeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a map-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we propose a spider mamba generator to restore the disturbed diverse weather data gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the LiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical structure of the LiDAR data. Subsequently, following the generator to transfer real-world knowledge, we design a latent feature aligner. Afterward, we devise a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision, guiding the diffusion model to generate more discriminative data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream task under adverse weather conditions. Code is available: https://github.com/wuyang98/weathergen

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework, HDBFormer, for RGB-D semantic segmentation in indoor scenes. It addresses the challenge of effectively integrating color information from RGB images with spatial distance information from depth images by distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images. HDBFormer consists of a basic and detail encoder for RGB images and a lightweight hierarchical encoder, LDFormer, for depth images. The Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM) combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to efficiently interact global and local information across modalities. Extensive experiments on NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets show that HDBFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code for HDBFormer is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Weishuobin/HDBFormer. <div>

Abstract: In RGB-D semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, a key challenge is effectively integrating the rich color information from RGB images with the spatial distance information from depth images. However, most existing methods overlook the inherent differences in how RGB and depth images express information. Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/Weishuobin/HDBFormer.

<div> Keywords: 3D scene understanding, deep learning, CAD models, ScanNet++, automatic annotations

Summary: 
High-quality 3D scene understanding is crucial for various applications, but generating accurate 3D annotations is challenging for deep learning models. By leveraging automatic retrieval of synthetic CAD models, researchers demonstrate that data generated by this method can serve as high-quality ground truth for training deep learning models. Using a pipeline similar to automatically annotating objects in ScanNet scenes with 9D poses and CAD models, the researchers apply this approach to the ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which previously lacked such annotations. They show that training on automatically-obtained annotations yields models that outperform those trained on manually annotated data. By validating on point cloud completion and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment tasks, they highlight the potential of automatic 3D annotations to improve model performance and reduce annotation costs. The researchers plan to release their annotations, called SCANnotate++, along with their trained models to support future research in 3D scene understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-level 3D scene understanding is essential in many applications. However, the challenges of generating accurate 3D annotations make development of deep learning models difficult. We turn to recent advancements in automatic retrieval of synthetic CAD models, and show that data generated by such methods can be used as high-quality ground truth for training supervised deep learning models. More exactly, we employ a pipeline akin to the one previously used to automatically annotate objects in ScanNet scenes with their 9D poses and CAD models. This time, we apply it to the recent ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which previously lacked such annotations. Our findings demonstrate that it is not only possible to train deep learning models on these automatically-obtained annotations but that the resulting models outperform those trained on manually annotated data. We validate this on two distinct tasks: point cloud completion and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment. Our results underscore the potential of automatic 3D annotations to enhance model performance while significantly reducing annotation costs. To support future research in 3D scene understanding, we will release our annotations, which we call SCANnotate++, along with our trained models.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic Expert Clustering (HAEC) for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding in city-scale datasets. Traditional techniques rely on hand-annotated label sets, but HAEC utilizes superpoint graph clustering and a mixture of experts graph transformer for efficient processing. This approach is applied to the SensatUrban city-scale dataset, showcasing its scalability and ability to handle dense urban 3D scenes. The method also includes a synthetic labeling pipeline that derives labels from raw point clouds without manual annotation. By overcoming limitations of existing techniques and enabling complex operations on large 3D datasets, HAEC paves the way for advancements in processing digital twins. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Traditional 3D scene understanding techniques are generally predicated on hand-annotated label sets, but in recent years a new class of open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding techniques has emerged. Despite the success of this paradigm on small scenes, existing approaches cannot scale efficiently to city-scale 3D datasets. In this paper, we present Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic Expert Clustering (HAEC), after the latin word for 'these', a superpoint graph clustering based approach which utilizes a novel mixture of experts graph transformer for its backbone. We administer this highly scalable approach to the first application of open-vocabulary scene understanding on the SensatUrban city-scale dataset. We also demonstrate a synthetic labeling pipeline which is derived entirely from the raw point clouds with no hand-annotation. Our technique can help unlock complex operations on dense urban 3D scenes and open a new path forward in the processing of digital twins.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Point Cloud Analysis, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, Geometric Affine Module, Efficient-KANs 

Summary:
PointKAN introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to improve hierarchical feature representation in point cloud analysis. It incorporates a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to enhance robustness to geometric variations and processes local features in a parallel structure for detailed and global context representation. The model then integrates these features in Global Feature Processing (GFP), gradually expanding the receptive field to capture complete geometric information. Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant minimize parameter counts while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets like ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart show that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP, particularly excelling in Few-shot Learning tasks. Moreover, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity. This research highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new research avenues in point cloud understanding.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

<div> Keywords: 3D semantic occupancy prediction, autonomous driving, long-term memory priors, Current-Prior Fusion module, global occupancy representation

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces LMPOcc, a novel method for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving. It leverages long-term memory priors based on historical traversal data to enhance local perception and construct global occupancy representations. A Current-Prior Fusion module efficiently aggregates prior and current features. A model-agnostic prior format ensures compatibility with different prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, particularly in static semantic categories. The method was also successful in constructing global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing. <div>
arXiv:2504.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

<div> Keywords: Anti-UAV tracking, FocusTrack, Search Region Adjustment, Attention-to-Mask module, real-time tracking

Summary: 
FocusTrack is a novel framework designed to improve anti-UAV tracking by dynamically refining the search region and enhancing feature representations. It addresses challenges such as small target sizes, abrupt camera motion, and cluttered backgrounds. The Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates target presence probability and adjusts the field of view accordingly, ensuring the target remains in focus. The Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module enriches target representations with fine-grained details, combating feature degradation caused by varying search regions. Experimental results show that FocusTrack outperforms baseline trackers, achieving high accuracy with 30G MACs and enabling real-time tracking at 143 fps with SRA and 44 fps with the full version. This framework strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy, making it a promising solution for anti-UAV tracking. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-UAV tracking poses significant challenges, including small target sizes, abrupt camera motion, and cluttered infrared backgrounds. Existing tracking paradigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods. Global-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the entire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting real-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and ROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets undergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through preliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with adaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy, narrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge, we propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search region and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence probability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target remains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by varying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This module integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target representations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate that FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on AntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5% and 9.1% AUC, respectively. In terms of efficiency, FocusTrack surpasses global-based trackers, requiring only 30G MACs and achieving 143 fps with FocusTrack (SRA) and 44 fps with the full version, both enabling real-time tracking.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC) for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC). The framework aims to improve classification accuracy and consistency by leveraging hierarchical label relationships. CHBC extracts discriminative features across hierarchies using specialized modules to enhance attention masks and features. It utilizes bidirectional consistency loss to ensure label prediction consistency and reduce misclassification. Experiments on three FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CHBC framework.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) aims to categorize closely related subclasses, a task complicated by minimal inter-class differences and significant intra-class variance. Existing methods often rely on additional annotations for image classification, overlooking the valuable information embedded in Tree Hierarchies that depict hierarchical label relationships. To leverage this knowledge to improve classification accuracy and consistency, we propose a novel Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC) framework. The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various hierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance attention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to regulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring label prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on three widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC framework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of feature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant contributions of the proposed modules.

Summary:<br /><br />Next token prediction is crucial for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) enhances their reasoning abilities. However, utilizing LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations like scene graphs is less explored. R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM, is fine-tuned via supervised learning on scene graph data and further refined through reinforcement learning for generating scene graphs. A graph-centric reward system in RL, integrating node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and format consistency, enhances model performance significantly compared to supervised fine-tuning. The rule-based RL approach achieves a zero failure rate in scene graph generation task, indicating better generalization compared to SFT. The study showcases the potential of combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for improving multimodal LLM performance in structured visual representation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.

Summary: 
The article introduces EgoIntention, a dataset for egocentric visual intention grounding, challenging multimodal LLMs to understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and reason about uncommon object functionalities. Current models struggle with identifying context objects and lack affordance understanding in egocentric views. The Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning proposed enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions, improving performance significantly on EgoIntention while maintaining or slightly enhancing naive description grounding. This advancement allows for unified visual grounding for both egocentric and exocentric visual inputs, handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions effectively. <div>
arXiv:2504.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image. Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries. In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable results in object detection for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, owing to its exceptional ability to extract global features. However, it struggles with the extraction of multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer, Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large number of densely distributed vehicle targets.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for tumor segmentation using CT and PET scans.
- This framework allows for training on CT scans and efficient adaptation for PET scans when available, using low-rank adaptation techniques.
- Leveraging transformer architecture modularity, the proposed method achieves comparable performance to early fusion with significantly fewer parameters.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging, particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both PET and EHR data.

Abstract: Road anomaly detection plays a crucial role in road maintenance and in enhancing the safety of both drivers and vehicles. Recent machine learning approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps, collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) and their limitations in ophthalmic diagnosis due to the lack of specific data, benchmarking, and model adaptation. To address these challenges, the authors propose the Eyecare Kit, which consists of the Eyecare-100K dataset, Eyecare-Bench benchmark, and EyecareGPT model. The Eyecare-100K dataset is a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset created using real-life ophthalmology data.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) demonstrate significant potential in healthcare, but their reliance on general medical data and coarse-grained global visual understanding limits them in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis. Currently, intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis faces three major challenges: (i) Data. The lack of deeply annotated, high-quality, multi-modal ophthalmic visual instruction data; (ii) Benchmark. The absence of a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for evaluating diagnostic performance; (iii) Model. The difficulty of adapting holistic visual architectures to fine-grained, region-specific ophthalmic lesion identification. In this paper, we propose the Eyecare Kit, which systematically tackles the aforementioned three key challenges with the tailored dataset, benchmark and model: First, we construct a multi-agent data engine with real-life ophthalmology data to produce Eyecare-100K, a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset. Subsequently, we design Eyecare-Bench, a benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the overall performance of LVLMs on intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis tasks across multiple dimensions. Finally, we develop the EyecareGPT, optimized for fine-grained ophthalmic visual understanding thoroughly, which incorporates an adaptive resolution mechanism and a layer-wise dense connector. Extensive experimental results indicate that the EyecareGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of ophthalmic tasks, underscoring its significant potential for the advancement of open research in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis.

Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR) for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts. Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution images.

<title>Analysing the Robustness of Vision-Language-Models to Common Corruptions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13690</link>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual and textual content. However, their robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Zebrafish share a high degree of homology with human genes and are commonly used as model organism in biomedical research. For medical laboratories, counting zebrafish is a daily task. Due to the tiny size of zebrafish, manual visual counting is challenging. Existing counting methods are either not applicable to small fishes or have too many limitations. The paper proposed a zebrafish counting algorithm based on the event stream data. Firstly, an event camera is applied for data acquisition. Secondly, camera calibration and image fusion were preformed successively. Then, the trajectory information was used to improve the counting accuracy. Finally, the counting results were averaged over an empirical of period and rounded up to get the final results. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, 20 zebrafish were put in a four-liter breeding tank. Among 100 counting trials, the average accuracy reached 97.95%. As compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed one offers a simpler implementation and achieves higher accuracy.

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.

<title>MLEP: Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns for Universal AI-generated Image Detection</title>

Abstract: Advancements in image generation technologies have raised significant concerns about their potential misuse, such as producing misinformation and deepfakes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.

<title>LimitNet: Progressive, Content-Aware Image Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices &amp; Networks</title>

Abstract: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses.
  In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).

<title>ESPLoRA: Enhanced Spatial Precision with Low-Rank Adaption in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for High-Definition Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial consistency benchmarks.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, damage assessment, and resource management. While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains. Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.

<title>Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.

<title>Fragile Watermarking for Image Certification Using Deep Steganographic Embedding</title>

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric document integrity verification.

Abstract: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration across large parts of the world as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Modern hazard detection and response systems that deal with wildfires are under-equipped for sustained wildfire seasons. Recent work has proved automated wildfire detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on satellite imagery are capable of high-accuracy results. However, CNNs are computationally expensive to train and only incorporate local image context. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity for their efficient training and their ability to include both local and global contextual information. In this work, we show that ViT can outperform well-trained and specialized CNNs to detect wildfires on a previously published dataset of LandSat-8 imagery. One of our ViTs outperforms the baseline CNN comparison by 0.92%. However, we find our own implementation of CNN-based UNet to perform best in every category, showing their sustained utility in image tasks. Overall, ViTs are comparably capable in detecting wildfires as CNNs, though well-tuned CNNs are still the best technique for detecting wildfire with our UNet providing an IoU of 93.58%, better than the baseline UNet by some 4.58%.

Abstract: The unpaired point cloud completion task aims to complete a partial point cloud by using models trained with no ground truth. Existing unpaired point cloud completion methods are class-aware, i.e., a separate model is needed for each object class. Since they have limited generalization capabilities, these methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios when confronted with a wide range of point clouds of generic 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel unpaired point cloud completion framework, namely the Reference-guided Completion (RefComp) framework, which attains strong performance in both the class-aware and class-agnostic training settings. The RefComp framework transforms the unpaired completion problem into a shape translation problem, which is solved in the latent feature space of the partial point clouds. To this end, we introduce the use of partial-complete point cloud pairs, which are retrieved by using the partial point cloud to be completed as a template. These point cloud pairs are used as reference data to guide the completion process. Our RefComp framework uses a reference branch and a target branch with shared parameters for shape fusion and shape translation via a Latent Shape Fusion Module (LSFM) to enhance the structural features along the completion pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RefComp framework achieves not only state-of-the-art performance in the class-aware training setting but also competitive results in the class-agnostic training setting on both virtual scans and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Humans can develop internal world models that encode common sense knowledge, telling them how the world works and predicting the consequences of their actions. This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images. Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists, including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures); 2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients). Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale medical foundation models. Code & pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/CheXWorld.

Abstract: Multi-model fitting (MMF) presents a significant challenge in Computer Vision, particularly due to its combinatorial nature. While recent advancements in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF) algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers (AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare, particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact. This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets, improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs, traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among its many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive nature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical professionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods require extensive computational resources and prolonged training times, limiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings. In this work, we present a novel dual-decoder U-Net architecture enhanced with attention-gated skip connections, designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. Our approach balances efficiency and accuracy by achieving competitive segmentation performance while significantly reducing training demands. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the proposed model achieved Dice scores of 85.06% for Whole Tumor (WT), 80.61% for Tumor Core (TC), and 71.26% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) in only 50 epochs, surpassing several commonly used U-Net variants. Our model demonstrates that high-quality brain tumor segmentation is attainable even under limited computational resources, thereby offering a viable solution for researchers and clinicians operating with modest hardware. This resource-efficient model has the potential to improve early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes

Abstract: In this study, we address the challenges associated with accurately determining gaze location on a screen, which is often compromised by noise from factors such as eye tracker limitations, calibration drift, ambient lighting changes, and eye blinks. We propose the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to smooth the gaze data collected during eye-tracking experiments, and systematically explore the interaction of different system parameters. Our results demonstrate that the EKF significantly reduces noise, leading to a marked improvement in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our proposed stochastic nonlinear dynamical model aligns well with real experimental data and holds promise for applications in related fields.

Abstract: To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR processor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine the pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical plane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the processor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match the images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in conjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible identifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref. 1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the ship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle and the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a short time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose. However, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect angle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle, representing variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive, and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power, reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.

<title>SMPL-GPTexture: Dual-View 3D Human Texture Estimation using Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

Abstract: Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field. However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts.

Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.

Abstract: Inspired by their success in solving challenging inverse problems in computer vision, implicit neural representations (INRs) have been recently proposed for reconstruction in low-dose/sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). An INR represents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial coordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to sinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction methods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can be prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This paper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT reconstruction. In particular, we propose two approaches: (1) using a modified loss function with improved conditioning, and (2) an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate that both of these approaches significantly accelerate INR-based reconstruction of a synthetic breast CT phantom in a sparse-view setting.

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management. Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases, abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity (RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety, reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging (LangPack) for efficiently packaging information into concise, language-based messages. Through extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulations, we demonstrate that LangCoop achieves a remarkable 96\% reduction in communication bandwidth (< 2KB per message) compared to image-based communication, while maintaining competitive driving performance in the closed-loop evaluation.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance results are described. The performance results show that this approach has attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading techniques both in DSC and HD.

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space. Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

<title>Filter2Noise: Interpretable Self-Supervised Single-Image Denoising for Low-Dose CT with Attention-Guided Bilateral Filtering</title>

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework -- Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at https://github.com/sypsyp97/Filter2Noise.git .

Abstract: We present a novel Adaptive Distribution Generator that leverages a quantum walks-based approach to generate high precision and efficiency of target probability distributions. Our method integrates variational quantum circuits with discrete-time quantum walks, specifically, split-step quantum walks and their entangled extensions, to dynamically tune coin parameters and drive the evolution of quantum states towards desired distributions. This enables accurate one-dimensional probability modeling for applications such as financial simulation and structured two-dimensional pattern generation exemplified by digit representations(0~9). Implemented within the CUDA-Q framework, our approach exploits GPU acceleration to significantly reduce computational overhead and improve scalability relative to conventional methods. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that our Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generator achieves high simulation fidelity and bridges the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical high-performance computation.

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation provides essential structural information for ophthalmic image analysis. However, existing methods struggle with challenges such as multi-scale vessel variability, complex curvatures, and ambiguous boundaries. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer-based models and Mamba-based architectures have advanced the field, they often suffer from vascular discontinuities or edge feature ambiguity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates CNNs and Mamba for high-precision retinal vessel segmentation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) The proposed High-Resolution Edge Fuse Network is a high-resolution preserving hybrid segmentation framework that combines a multi-scale backbone with the Multi-scale Retina Edge Fusion (MREF) module to enhance edge features, ensuring accurate and robust vessel segmentation. 2) The Dynamic Snake Visual State Space block combines Dynamic Snake Convolution with Mamba to adaptively capture vessel curvature details and long-range dependencies. An improved eight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting strategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF module enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature aggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures across scales. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in maintaining vascular continuity and effectively segmenting vessels in low-contrast regions. This work provides a robust method for clinical applications requiring accurate retinal vessel analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/frank-oy/HREFNet.

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is vital in the early diagnosis of colorectal polyps. Regular screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different modalities. The source code for FocusNet is available at https://github.com/JunZengz/FocusNet.

Abstract: Accurate vascular segmentation is essential for coronary visualization and the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This task involves the extraction of sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high segmentation accuracy. Our code will be available soon.

Abstract: In this work, we present SupResDiffGAN, a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models for super-resolution tasks. By leveraging latent space representations and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption, ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency and image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and GAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of diffusion models in high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.

Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).

Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for novel view synthesis and scene rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&amp;Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&amp;Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.

<title>Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback</title>

Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.

<title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

Abstract: This paper focuses on improving the mathematical interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification. Specifically, we tackle the instability issue arising in their first layer, which tends to learn parameters that closely resemble oriented band-pass filters when trained on datasets like ImageNet. Subsampled convolutions with such Gabor-like filters are prone to aliasing, causing sensitivity to small input shifts. In this context, we establish conditions under which the max pooling operator approximates a complex modulus, which is nearly shift invariant. We then derive a measure of shift invariance for subsampled convolutions followed by max pooling. In particular, we highlight the crucial role played by the filter's frequency and orientation in achieving stability. We experimentally validate our theory by considering a deterministic feature extractor based on the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, a particular case of discrete Gabor-like decomposition.

Abstract: The video generation field has witnessed rapid improvements with the introduction of recent diffusion models. While these models have successfully enhanced appearance quality, they still face challenges in generating coherent and natural movements while efficiently sampling videos. In this paper, we propose to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. Specifically, we present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Consequently, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos on various benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape, NATOPS, MUG and CATER-GEN, that encompass a variety of stochastic dynamics and highly controllable movements on multiple image-conditional video generation tasks, while significantly decreases sampling time.

Abstract: Enhancing a low-light noisy RAW image into a well-exposed and clean sRGB image is a significant challenge for modern digital cameras. Prior approaches have difficulties in recovering fine-grained details and true colors of the scene under extremely low-light environments due to near-to-zero SNR. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown significant progress towards general domain image generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the pre-trained latent diffusion model to perform the neural ISP for enhancing extremely low-light images. Specifically, to tailor the pre-trained latent diffusion model to operate on the RAW domain, we train a set of lightweight taming modules to inject the RAW information into the diffusion denoising process via modulating the intermediate features of UNet. We further observe different roles of UNet denoising and decoder reconstruction in the latent diffusion model, which inspires us to decompose the low-light image enhancement task into latent-space low-frequency content generation and decoding-phase high-frequency detail maintenance. Through extensive experiments on representative datasets, we demonstrate our simple design not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons over strong baselines, which highlight the effectiveness of powerful generative priors for neural ISP under extremely low-light environments.

Abstract: Pattern recognition based on RGB-Event data is a newly arising research topic and previous works usually learn their features using CNN or Transformer. As we know, CNN captures the local features well and the cascaded self-attention mechanisms are good at extracting the long-range global relations. It is intuitive to combine them for high-performance RGB-Event based video recognition, however, existing works fail to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and model parameters, as shown in Fig.~\ref{firstimage}. In this work, we propose a novel RGB-Event based recognition framework termed TSCFormer, which is a relatively lightweight CNN-Transformer model. Specifically, we mainly adopt the CNN as the backbone network to first encode both RGB and Event data. Meanwhile, we initialize global tokens as the input and fuse them with RGB and Event features using the BridgeFormer module. It captures the global long-range relations well between both modalities and maintains the simplicity of the whole model architecture at the same time. The enhanced features will be projected and fused into the RGB and Event CNN blocks, respectively, in an interactive manner using F2E and F2V modules. Similar operations are conducted for other CNN blocks to achieve adaptive fusion and local-global feature enhancement under different resolutions. Finally, we concatenate these three features and feed them into the classification head for pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on two large-scale RGB-Event benchmark datasets (PokerEvent and HARDVS) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed TSCFormer. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/TSCFormer.

Abstract: Cancer subtyping is one of the most challenging tasks in digital pathology, where Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) by processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) has been in the spotlight of recent research. However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

Abstract: We propose Masked Capsule Autoencoders (MCAE), the first Capsule Network that utilises pretraining in a modern self-supervised paradigm, specifically the masked image modelling framework. Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They have shown favourable properties when compared to Vision Transformers (ViT), but have struggled to effectively learn when presented with more complex data. This has led to Capsule Network models that do not scale to modern tasks. Our proposed MCAE model alleviates this issue by reformulating the Capsule Network to use masked image modelling as a pretraining stage before finetuning in a supervised manner. Across several experiments and ablations studies we demonstrate that similarly to CNNs and ViTs, Capsule Networks can also benefit from self-supervised pretraining, paving the way for further advancements in this neural network domain. For instance, by pretraining on the Imagenette dataset-consisting of 10 classes of Imagenet-sized images-we achieve state-of-the-art results for Capsule Networks, demonstrating a 9% improvement compared to our baseline model. Thus, we propose that Capsule Networks benefit from and should be trained within a masked image modelling framework, using a novel capsule decoder, to enhance a Capsule Network's performance on realistically sized images.

Abstract: Contrastive instance discrimination methods outperform supervised learning in downstream tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, these methods rely heavily on data augmentation during representation learning, which can lead to suboptimal results if not implemented carefully. A common augmentation technique in contrastive learning is random cropping followed by resizing. This can degrade the quality of representation learning when the two random crops contain distinct semantic content. To tackle this issue, we introduce LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a novel instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function. This method prevents the loss of important semantic features caused by mapping different object parts during representation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that LeOCLR consistently improves representation learning across various datasets, outperforming baseline models. For instance, LeOCLR surpasses MoCo-v2 by 5.1% on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and outperforms several other methods on transfer learning and object detection tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have significantly advanced in recent years. However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel latent 3D diffusion model for the generation of neural voxel fields, aiming to achieve accurate part-aware structures. Compared to existing methods, there are two key designs to ensure high-quality and accurate part-aware generation. On one hand, we introduce a latent 3D diffusion process for neural voxel fields, enabling generation at significantly higher resolutions that can accurately capture rich textural and geometric details. On the other hand, a part-aware shape decoder is introduced to integrate the part codes into the neural voxel fields, guiding the accurate part decomposition and producing high-quality rendering results. Through extensive experimentation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we evaluate our approach across four different classes of data. The results demonstrate the superior generative capabilities of our proposed method in part-aware shape generation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.

Abstract: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: In laparoscopic and robotic surgery, precise tool instance segmentation is an essential technology for advanced computer-assisted interventions. Although publicly available procedures of routine surgeries exist, they often lack comprehensive annotations for tool instance segmentation. Additionally, the majority of standard datasets for tool segmentation are derived from porcine(pig) surgeries. To address this gap, we introduce CholecInstanceSeg, the largest open-access tool instance segmentation dataset to date. Derived from the existing CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets, CholecInstanceSeg provides novel annotations for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures in patients. Our dataset comprises 41.9k annotated frames extracted from 85 clinical procedures and 64.4k tool instances, each labelled with semantic masks and instance IDs. To ensure the reliability of our annotations, we perform extensive quality control, conduct label agreement statistics, and benchmark the segmentation results with various instance segmentation baselines. CholecInstanceSeg aims to advance the field by offering a comprehensive and high-quality open-access dataset for the development and evaluation of tool instance segmentation algorithms.

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT.

Abstract: Mapping the extent of flood events is a necessary and important aspect of disaster management. In recent years, deep learning methods have evolved as an effective tool to quickly label high resolution imagery and provide necessary flood extent mappings. These methods, though, require large amounts of annotated training data to create models that are accurate and robust to new flooded imagery. In this work, we present FloodTrace, a web-based application that enables effective crowdsourcing of flooded region annotation for machine learning applications. To create this application, we conducted extensive interviews with domain experts to produce a set of formal requirements. Our work brings topological segmentation tools to the web and greatly improves annotation efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. The user-friendliness of our solution allows researchers to outsource annotations to non-experts and utilize them to produce training data with equal quality to fully expert-labeled data. We conducted a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our application in which 266 graduate students annotated high-resolution aerial imagery from Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina. Experimental results show the efficiency benefits of our application for untrained users, with median annotation time less than half the state-of-the-art annotation method. In addition, using our aggregation and correction framework, flood detection models trained on crowdsourced annotations were able to achieve performance equal to models trained on fully expert-labeled annotations, while requiring a fraction of the time on the part of the expert.

<title>MambaMIM: Pre-training Mamba with State Space Token Interpolation and its Application to Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recently, the state space model Mamba has demonstrated efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities, particularly for addressing long-sequence visual tasks in 3D medical imaging. However, existing generative self-supervised learning methods have not yet fully unleashed Mamba's potential for handling long-range dependencies because they overlook the inherent causal properties of state space sequences in masked modeling. To address this challenge, we propose a general-purpose pre-training framework called MambaMIM, a masked image modeling method based on a novel TOKen-Interpolation strategy (TOKI) for the selective structure state space sequence, which learns causal relationships of state space within the masked sequence. Further, MambaMIM introduces a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy to maintain a masking consistency across different architectures and can be used on any single or hybrid Mamba architecture to enhance its multi-scale and long-range representation capability. We pre-train MambaMIM on a large-scale dataset of 6.8K CT scans and evaluate its performance across eight public medical segmentation benchmarks. Extensive downstream experiments reveal the feasibility and advancement of using Mamba for medical image pre-training. In particular, when we apply the MambaMIM to a customized architecture that hybridizes MedNeXt and Vision Mamba, we consistently obtain the state-of-the-art segmentation performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/FengheTan9/MambaMIM.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

<title>Mixture of Scale Experts for Alignment-free RGBT Video Object Detection and A Unified Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Existing RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) methods predominantly rely on the manual alignment of image pairs, that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This dependency significantly restricts the scalability and practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel framework termed the Mixture of Scale Experts Network (MSENet). MSENet integrates multiple experts trained at different perceptual scales, enabling the capture of scale discrepancies between RGB and thermal image pairs without the need for explicit alignment. Specifically, to address the issue of unaligned scales, MSENet introduces a set of experts designed to perceive the correlation between RGBT image pairs across various scales. These experts are capable of identifying and quantifying the scale differences inherent in the image pairs. Subsequently, a dynamic routing mechanism is incorporated to assign adaptive weights to each expert, allowing the network to dynamically select the most appropriate experts based on the specific characteristics of the input data. Furthermore, to address the issue of weakly unaligned positions, we integrate deformable convolution into the network. Deformable convolution is employed to learn position displacements between the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby mitigating the impact of spatial misalignment. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for alignment-free RGBT VOD, we introduce a new benchmark dataset. This dataset includes eleven common object categories, with a total of 60,988 images and 271,835 object instances. The dataset encompasses a wide range of scenes from both daily life and natural environments, ensuring high content diversity and complexity.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on accurate 3D object detection from LiDAR data, yet most detectors are limited to a predefined set of known classes, making them vulnerable to unexpected out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. In this work, we present HD-OOD3D, a novel two-stage method for detecting unknown objects. We demonstrate the superiority of two-stage approaches over single-stage methods, achieving more robust detection of unknown objects while addressing key challenges in the evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the standard evaluation protocol for OOD detection, revealing the critical impact of hyperparameter choices. To address the challenge of scaling the learning of unknown objects, we explore unsupervised training strategies to generate pseudo-labels for unknowns. Among the different approaches evaluated, our experiments show that top-5 auto-labelling offers more promising performance compared to simple resizing techniques.

Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.

<title>PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) utilizes partially labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to detect differences between multi-temporal remote sensing images. The mainstream SSCD methods based on consistency regularization have limitations. They perform perturbations mainly at a single level, restricting the utilization of unlabeled data and failing to fully tap its potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gate-guided Two-level Perturbation Consistency regularization-based SSCD method (GTPC-SSCD). It simultaneously maintains strong-to-weak consistency at the image level and perturbation consistency at the feature level, enhancing the utilization efficiency of unlabeled data. Moreover, we develop a hardness analysis-based gating mechanism to assess the training complexity of different samples and determine the necessity of performing feature perturbations for each sample. Through this differential treatment, the network can explore the potential of unlabeled data more efficiently. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark CD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GTPC-SSCD over seven state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently continuous and dynamic, posing significant challenges for generative models. While discrete generation methods are widely used, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. In contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but often struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this discord between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages rectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion space. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation task, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves smoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals on diverse settings.

<title>AnomalyControl: Learning Cross-modal Semantic Features for Controllable Anomaly Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Global geolocation, which seeks to predict the geographical location of images captured anywhere in the world, is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs), like recent Mamba architectures, are emerging as a promising alternative to CNN and Transformer networks. Existing Mamba-based restoration methods process visual data by leveraging a flatten-and-scan strategy that converts image patches into a 1D sequence before scanning. However, this scanning paradigm ignores local pixel dependencies and introduces spatial misalignment by positioning distant pixels incorrectly adjacent, which reduces local noise-awareness and degrades image sharpness in low-level vision tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slice-and-scan strategy that alternates scanning along intra- and inter-slices. We further design a new Vision State Space Module (VSSM) for image deblurring, and tackle the inefficiency challenges of the current Mamba-based vision module. Building upon this, we develop XYScanNet, an SSM architecture integrated with a lightweight feature fusion module for enhanced image deblurring. XYScanNet, maintains competitive distortion metrics and significantly improves perceptual performance. Experimental results show that XYScanNet enhances KID by $17\%$ compared to the nearest competitor.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, MultiShield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. MultiShield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that MultiShield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of text-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose EditSplat, a novel text-driven 3D scene editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric structure inherent to 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT utilizes the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a new benchmark for text-driven 3D scene editing.

Abstract: The field of self-supervised learning (SSL) for 3D medical images lacks consistency and standardization. While many methods have been developed, it is impossible to identify the current state-of-the-art, due to i) varying and small pretraining datasets, ii) varying architectures, and iii) being evaluated on differing downstream datasets. In this paper, we bring clarity to this field and lay the foundation for further method advancements through three key contributions: We a) publish the largest publicly available pre-training dataset comprising 114k 3D brain MRI volumes, enabling all practitioners to pre-train on a large-scale dataset. We b) benchmark existing 3D self-supervised learning methods on this dataset for a state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architecture, clarifying the state of 3D SSL pre-training. Among many findings, we show that pre-trained methods can exceed a strong from-scratch nnU-Net ResEnc-L baseline. Lastly, we c) publish the code of our pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks and provide the pre-trained models created during the benchmarking process to facilitate rapid adoption and reproduction.

Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Abstract: Multimodal image registration plays a key role in creating digital patient models by combining data from different imaging techniques into a single coordinate system. This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in https://github.com/XingruiWang/Spatial457.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant success in the field of remote sensing image change detection (CD), yet two major challenges remain: the scarcity of sub-meter, comprehensive open-source CD datasets, and the difficulty of achieving consistent and satisfactory detection results across images with varying change areas. To address these issues, we introduce the JL1-CD dataset, which consists of 5,000 pairs of 512 x 512 pixel images with a resolution of 0.5 to 0.75 meters. This all-inclusive dataset covers a wide range of human-induced and natural changes, including buildings, roads, hardened surfaces, woodlands, grasslands, croplands, water bodies, and photovoltaic panels, among others. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework that leverages the Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy to enhance CD performance. In the O-P strategy, we partition the training data based on the Change Area Ratio (CAR) to train separate models for small, medium, and large CAR values, alleviating the learning burden on each model and improving their performance within their respective partitions. Building upon this, our MTKD framework distills knowledge from multiple teacher models trained on different CAR partitions into a single student model,enabling the student model to achieve superior detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without incurring additional computational or time overhead during the inference phase. Experimental results on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets demonstrate that the MTKD framework significantly improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The JL1-CD dataset and code are available at https://github.com/circleLZY/MTKD-CD.

Abstract: The complex application scenarios have raised critical requirements for precise and generalizable gaze estimation methods. Recently, the pre-trained CLIP has achieved remarkable performance on various vision tasks, but its potentials have not been fully exploited in gaze estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel Differential Contrastive Training strategy, which boosts gaze estimation performance with the help of the CLIP. Accordingly, a Differential Contrastive Gaze Estimation network (DCGaze) composed of a Visual Appearance-aware branch and a Semantic Differential-aware branch is introduced. The Visual Appearance-aware branch is essentially a primary gaze estimation network and it incorporates an Adaptive Feature-refinement Unit (AFU) and a Double-head Gaze Regressor (DGR), which both help the primary network to extract informative and gaze-related appearance features. Moreover, the Semantic Difference-aware branch is designed on the basis of the CLIP's text encoder to reveal the semantic difference of gazes. This branch could further empower the Visual Appearance-aware branch with the capability of characterizing the gaze-related semantic information. Extensive experimental results on four challenging datasets over within and cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCGaze. Code will be available upon acceptance.

<title>PTDiffusion: Free Lunch for Generating Optical Illusion Hidden Pictures with Phase-Transferred Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Optical illusion hidden picture is an interesting visual perceptual phenomenon where an image is cleverly integrated into another picture in a way that is not immediately obvious to the viewer. Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. Our project is publically available at \href{https://xianggao1102.github.io/PTDiffusion_webpage/}{this web page}.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

Abstract: We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the 6th in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023), and the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing pipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects. The online evaluation system stays open and is available at http://bop.felk.cvut.cz/

Abstract: The diagnosis of pathological images is often limited by expert availability and regional disparities, highlighting the importance of automated diagnosis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.

Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.

Abstract: We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion. See our project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/Vivid4D/.

Abstract: Sponge examples are test-time inputs optimized to increase energy consumption and prediction latency of deep networks deployed on hardware accelerators. By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue.

Abstract: Not yet. We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.

Abstract: Recent advancements in head avatar rendering using Gaussian primitives have achieved significantly high-fidelity results. Although precise head geometry is crucial for applications like mesh reconstruction and relighting, current methods struggle to capture intricate geometric details and render unseen poses due to their reliance on similarity transformations, which cannot handle stretch and shear transforms essential for detailed deformations of geometry. To address this, we propose SurFhead, a novel method that reconstructs riggable head geometry from RGB videos using 2D Gaussian surfels, which offer well-defined geometric properties, such as precise depth from fixed ray intersections and normals derived from their surface orientation, making them advantageous over 3D counterparts. SurFhead ensures high-fidelity rendering of both normals and images, even in extreme poses, by leveraging classical mesh-based deformation transfer and affine transformation interpolation. SurFhead introduces precise geometric deformation and blends surfels through polar decomposition of transformations, including those affecting normals. Our key contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as mesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous avatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven by Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.

Abstract: Underwater imagery often suffers from severe degradation resulting in low visual quality and reduced object detection performance. This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their effects on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we apply nine recent underwater image enhancement models, covering physical, non-physical and learning-based categories, to two recent underwater image datasets. Following this, we conduct joint qualitative and quantitative analyses on the original and enhanced images, revealing the discrepancy between the two analyses, and analyzing changes in the quality distribution of the images after enhancement. We then train three recent object detection models on the original datasets, selecting the best-performing detector for further analysis. This detector is subsequently re-trained on the enhanced datasets to evaluate changes in detection performance, highlighting the adverse effect of enhancement on detection performance at the dataset level. Next, we perform a correlation study to examine the relationship between various enhancement metrics and the mean Average Precision (mAP). Finally, we conduct an image-level analysis that reveals images of improved detection performance after enhancement. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of image enhancement to improve detection performance and provide valuable insights for researchers to further explore the effects of enhancement on detection at the individual image level, rather than at the dataset level. This could enable the selective application of enhancement for improved detection. The data generated, code developed, and supplementary materials are publicly available at: https://github.com/RSSL-MTU/Enhancement-Detection-Analysis.

Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of consolidating multiple specialized text-to-image (T2I) generation models into a single, versatile model to reduce redundancy and storage costs. Traditional model merging techniques using static linear interpolation may lead to compatibility issues due to various styles covered by distinct models. The proposed solution introduces a style-promptable image generation pipeline that allows for accurate arbitrary-style image generation controlled by style vectors. The model merging paradigm, called score distillation based model merging (DMM), compresses knowledge from multiple models into a unified T2I model capable of controllable arbitrary-style generation. The study also presents new merging goals and evaluation protocols specific to the T2I generation task. Results from experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DMM in reorganizing knowledge from multiple models and achieving versatile T2I generation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The success of text-to-image (T2I) generation models has spurred a proliferation of numerous model checkpoints fine-tuned from the same base model on various specialized datasets. This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost, thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors. Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model. Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.

Summary:
BRIDGE-LC proposes a deep learning framework for land cover mapping that incorporates multi-scale geospatial information to enhance scalability and accuracy on regional to global scales. By integrating fine-grained and coarse-grained spatial information, the framework disentangles region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework was evaluated using an in-situ dataset, comparing different classification approaches in two scenarios: extrapolation and leave-one-region-out. Results show that integrating geospatial information leads to improved land cover mapping performance, with the most significant gains seen when both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information are jointly leveraged. Through analysis of the model's internal representation, a connection between its learned manifold and the geographical information used during training was identified. Overall, BRIDGE-LC demonstrates the potential for geospatial information integration to enhance land cover mapping accuracy and scalability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region) spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance, with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information.

Summary:<br />
WorldMem is a framework designed to improve scene generation in world simulation by incorporating a memory bank. This memory bank stores memory frames and states, such as poses and timestamps, to enhance long-term consistency in maintaining 3D spatial accuracy. By utilizing a memory attention mechanism, WorldMem can accurately reconstruct scenes even with significant viewpoint or temporal gaps. The inclusion of timestamps allows for the dynamic evolution of the simulated world to be captured, enabling both perception and interaction within the environment. Extensive experiments in virtual and real scenarios have shown the effectiveness of WorldMem in accurately modeling and predicting the consequences of actions in simulated environments. The framework provides a promising solution for enhancing the realism and accuracy of world simulation models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: World simulation has gained increasing popularity due to its ability to model virtual environments and predict the consequences of actions. However, the limited temporal context window often leads to failures in maintaining long-term consistency, particularly in preserving 3D spatial consistency. In this work, we present WorldMem, a framework that enhances scene generation with a memory bank consisting of memory units that store memory frames and states (e.g., poses and timestamps). By employing a memory attention mechanism that effectively extracts relevant information from these memory frames based on their states, our method is capable of accurately reconstructing previously observed scenes, even under significant viewpoint or temporal gaps. Furthermore, by incorporating timestamps into the states, our framework not only models a static world but also captures its dynamic evolution over time, enabling both perception and interaction within the simulated world. Extensive experiments in both virtual and real scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Current learning-based subject customization approaches, predominantly relying on U-Net architectures, suffer from limited generalization ability and compromised image quality. Meanwhile, optimization-based methods require subject-specific fine-tuning, which inevitably degrades textual controllability. To address these challenges, we propose InstantCharacter, a scalable framework for character customization built upon a foundation diffusion transformer. InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental advantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse character appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity results. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character features and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion transformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a large-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset is systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired (text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables simultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability through distinct learning pathways. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the advanced capabilities of InstantCharacter in generating high-fidelity, text-controllable, and character-consistent images, setting a new benchmark for character-driven image generation.

<div> Sparse Optimization, Vision-Language Models, Few-shot Adaptation, Overfitting, Generalization 

Summary:
Sparse Optimization (SO) framework proposed for adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in low-data domains. Unlike low-rank approaches, SO leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust a minimal subset of parameters, reducing overfitting and computational constraints. The framework utilizes local sparsity and global density to update a minimal subset of parameters while maintaining model expressiveness. Additionally, local randomness and global importance paradigms are used to sparsify the gradient with random selection and prune the first moment based on importance. This approach enhances few-shot adaptation performance and reduces memory overhead. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that SO achieves state-of-the-art performance in adapting VLMs to new domains with few labeled samples. <div>

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for \textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory overhead.

Summary: 
3D-PointZshotS is a novel zero-shot 3D point cloud segmentation framework that leverages latent geometric prototypes (LGPs) to enhance feature generation and alignment. By integrating LGPs into the generator using a cross-attention mechanism, semantic features are enriched with fine-grained geometric details. The introduction of a self-consistency loss ensures feature robustness against point-wise perturbations, enhancing stability and generalization. The re-representation of visual and semantic features in a shared space bridges the semantic-visual gap, facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen classes. Experimental results on ScanNet, SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS datasets demonstrate superior performance in terms of harmonic mIoU compared to four baseline methods. The code for 3D-PointZshotS is available on Github for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing zero-shot 3D point cloud segmentation methods often struggle with limited transferability from seen classes to unseen classes and from semantic to visual space. To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a geometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature generation and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs). Specifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention mechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To further enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency loss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations. Additionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space, bridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen classes. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet, SemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, point cloud classification, CAD models, domain generalization, convolution-based model

Summary:
In this paper, the focus is on addressing the challenge of domain generalization in 3D point cloud classification. The traditional approach of using point-based backbones to extract features has limitations due to the loss of point information through max-pooling. The proposed method tackles this issue by utilizing multiple 2D projections of 3D point clouds to account for missing points and employing a simple yet effective convolution-based model for feature extraction. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, including PointDA-10 and Sim-to-Real, the method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baselines. The results indicate the method's ability to generalize well to unseen domains of point clouds, showcasing its potential in transferring knowledge from synthetic to real-world domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in 3D point cloud classification while relying on large-scale, annotated point cloud datasets, which are labor-intensive to build. Compared to capturing data with LiDAR sensors and then performing annotation, it is relatively easier to sample point clouds from CAD models. Yet, data sampled from CAD models is regular, and does not suffer from occlusion and missing points, which are very common for LiDAR data, creating a large domain shift. Therefore, it is critical to develop methods that can generalize well across different point cloud domains. %In this paper, we focus on the 3D point cloud domain generalization problem. Existing 3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point cloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and observing the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found that a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods through the max-pooling operation. This is a significant waste especially considering the fact that domain generalization is more challenging than supervised learning, and point clouds are already affected by missing points and occlusion to begin with. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for 3D point cloud domain generalization, which can generalize to unseen domains of point clouds. Our proposed method employs multiple 2D projections of a 3D point cloud to alleviate the issue of missing points and involves a simple yet effective convolution-based model to extract features. The experiments, performed on the PointDA-10 and Sim-to-Real benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms different baselines, and can transfer well from synthetic domain to real-world domain.

<div> adaptive transformer block, video encoders, compute efficiency, hierarchical network, video-language pretraining

Summary:
AdaVid introduces an architectural framework for efficient video encoders that can dynamically adjust their computational footprint based on available resources. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, AdaVid features an adaptive transformer block that enables the model to modify its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the Ego4D dataset, achieves performance on par with standard EgoVLP using only half the compute. It even outperforms EgoVLP when given equal computational resources. By exploring the trade-off between frame count and compute on the Diving48 classification benchmark, AdaVid allows for the processing of more frames without exceeding computational limits. Additionally, a lightweight hierarchical network is proposed to handle longer videos by aggregating short clip features, striking a balance between compute efficiency and accuracy across various long video benchmarks.

Abstract: Contrastive video-language pretraining has demonstrated great success in learning rich and robust video representations. However, deploying such video encoders on compute-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational demands. Additionally, existing models are typically trained to process only short video clips, often limited to 4 to 64 frames. In this paper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to learn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational footprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive transformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows the model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show that AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D dataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language benchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given equal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame count and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing that AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational limits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical network that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between compute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.

Event cameras offer unique advantages in vision sensing, but the lack of labeled datasets hinders their adoption in deep learning. To address this issue, simulators have been developed to generate synthetic event data for training models, but accurately simulating event camera data remains a challenge. The introduction of the event quality score (EQS) as a quality metric, utilizing activations of the RVT architecture, aims to improve the generalization of models trained on simulated events to real-world data. By optimizing for EQS, more realistic event camera simulators can be developed, reducing the simulation gap.

Abstract: Event cameras promise a paradigm shift in vision sensing with their low latency, high dynamic range, and asynchronous nature of events. Unfortunately, the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets hinders their widespread adoption in deep learning-driven computer vision. To mitigate this, several simulators have been proposed to generate synthetic event data for training models for detection and estimation tasks. However, the fundamentally different sensor design of event cameras compared to traditional frame-based cameras poses a challenge for accurate simulation. As a result, most simulated data fail to mimic data captured by real event cameras. Inspired by existing work on using deep features for image comparison, we introduce event quality score (EQS), a quality metric that utilizes activations of the RVT architecture. Through sim-to-real experiments on the DSEC driving dataset, it is shown that a higher EQS implies improved generalization to real-world data after training on simulated events. Thus, optimizing for EQS can lead to developing more realistic event camera simulators, effectively reducing the simulation gap. EQS is available at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/EQS.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose cardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert sonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally only available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and algorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the standardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease pathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to predict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates a novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying the inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained offline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to determine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The underlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the learned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in real-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on traditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive zero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable Butterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the expansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the guidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly iQ app.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of detecting hurricane debris accurately and timely using aerial imagery. The research focuses on developing a generalized solution for debris segmentation across various disaster regions by fine-tuning pre-trained vision models with a small dataset. An open-source dataset of annotated aerial images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike is introduced, ensuring high data quality by aggregating labels from multiple annotators and employing visual prompt engineering. The fine-tuned model, fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on Hurricane Ida data, even though this event was excluded during training, with minimal false positives in debris-free areas. This model is the first event-agnostic debris segmentation solution that only requires standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it ideal for rapid post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning. <div>

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.

Digital Twins (DTs) are utilized in a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving analysis of Operating Room (OR) videos for event detection. Vision foundation models are used for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to create de-identified DTs from RGB videos in the first stage.

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

Abstract: The elliptical shape prior information plays a vital role in improving the accuracy of image segmentation for specific tasks in medical and natural images. Existing deep learning-based segmentation methods, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM), often struggle to produce segmentation results with elliptical shapes efficiently. This paper proposes a new approach to integrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image segmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method establishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the segmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing the dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with elliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing segmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems, we integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network structure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical regions. Experimental results on some specific image datasets demonstrate an improvement over the original SAM.

Summary: 
Active learning is utilized in the selection of surgical video frames to create a dataset for semantic segmentation in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. This approach integrates dataset construction into the deep learning pipeline, enabling the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to improve performance and generalization by selecting the most informative data from newly collected samples. Deep feature distances are identified as an effective metric for data informativeness in this context. Experimental results demonstrate that with only half of the data selected through active learning, the DNNs achieve comparable performance to training on the full dataset, with a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.4349 and 0.4374 on critical anatomies and surgical instruments, respectively. The active learning strategy proves to be a cost-effective and efficient method for enhancing deep learning models in medical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374 mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Summary:<br /><br />
Diffusion models in image generation have increased the need for privacy-compliant unlearning. Existing methods struggle with selective unlearning, as they find it challenging to remove sensitive information while maintaining consistency in non-sensitive areas. To address this issue, a new Automatic Dataset Creation Framework is proposed, which includes prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal. The framework introduces the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled evaluation metric to measure unlearning effectiveness. The ForgetMe dataset comprises real and synthetic scenarios, including popular datasets like CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet, along with a synthetic cat dataset. LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion is applied to achieve selective unlearning on the ForgetMe dataset. The effectiveness of the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric is validated, making them benchmarks for selective unlearning in privacy-preserving generative AI. <div>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.

Abstract: Event cameras have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their advantages in high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, low power consumption, and low latency. Some researchers have begun exploring pre-training directly on event data. Nevertheless, these efforts often fail to establish strong connections with RGB frames, limiting their applicability in multi-modal fusion scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel CM3AE pre-training framework for the RGB-Event perception. This framework accepts multi-modalities/views of data as input, including RGB images, event images, and event voxels, providing robust support for both event-based and RGB-event fusion based downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a multi-modal fusion reconstruction module that reconstructs the original image from fused multi-modal features, explicitly enhancing the model's ability to aggregate cross-modal complementary information. Additionally, we employ a multi-modal contrastive learning strategy to align cross-modal feature representations in a shared latent space, which effectively enhances the model's capability for multi-modal understanding and capturing global dependencies. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 2,535,759 RGB-Event data pairs for the pre-training. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM3AE. Source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/CM3AE.

<div> Keywords: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation, semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labels, teacher-student paradigm, dynamic weighting <br />
Summary: 
3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) typically relies on extensive instance-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been introduced to use limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods in the context of 3D-RES often discard valuable pseudo-labels, limiting the model's potential. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel semi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES named 3DResT, overcoming the challenges of inefficient utilization of high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, the authors propose two innovative designs, Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven Dynamic Weighting (QDW), which significantly improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DResT, achieving notable improvements in mIoU with only 1% labeled data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) typically requires extensive instance-level annotations, which are time-consuming and costly. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this by using limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data, improving performance while reducing annotation costs. SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates high-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the context of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled data is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as auxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The reliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in potentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's ability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data. Therefore, we identify two critical challenges in semi-supervised 3D-RES, namely, inefficient utilization of high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from low-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce the first semi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES, presenting a robust baseline method named 3DResT. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs called Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven Dynamic Weighting (QDW). TSCS aids in the selection of high-quality pseudo-labels, integrating them into the labeled dataset to strengthen the labeled supervision signals. QDW preserves low-quality pseudo-labels by dynamically assigning them lower weights, allowing for the effective extraction of useful information rather than discarding them. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, with only 1% labeled data, 3DResT achieves an mIoU improvement of 8.34 points compared to the fully supervised method.

<div> Diffusion, Perceptual quality assessment, Image restoration, AdaQual-Diff, Adaptive Quality Prompting <br />
Summary:
AdaQual-Diff introduces a diffusion-based framework for image restoration that directly integrates perceptual quality assessment. The approach utilizes regional quality scores from DeQAScore to adjust guidance complexity, dynamically allocating computational resources based on degradation severity. This quality-guided approach, combined with content-specific conditioning, allows for fine-grained control over restoration intensity without additional parameters or inference iterations. By modulating prompt structure according to measured degradation severity, AdaQual-Diff achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>
arXiv:2504.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring images afflicted by complex real-world degradations remains challenging, as conventional methods often fail to adapt to the unique mixture and severity of artifacts present. This stems from a reliance on indirect cues which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity, implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives, while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity, creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Robo-SGG, a method for robust scene graph generation that addresses domain shift in corrupted images. It utilizes layout information to enhance visual features and employs Instance Normalization to filter out domain-specific features. The proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution recovers positional and semantic relationships among objects. The Layout-Embedded Encoder augments object and predicate encoders within the SGG framework. The Robo-SGG module is plug-and-play and can be integrated into any baseline SGG model for improved performance. Experiments show relative improvements in PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C dataset, as well as state-of-the-art performance on corruption scene graph generation benchmarks (VG-C and GQA-C). The source code and model will be released for further research. <div>
arXiv:2504.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e., Layout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph Generation. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images, with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e., the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder (LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C). We will release our source code and model.

<br />
Summary: 
FAEWNet is a novel network proposed for building change detection in urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. It addresses challenges faced by existing methods, such as imbalanced building distribution and bi-temporal misalignment. By utilizing the SAM encoder and introducing a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter, FAEWNet effectively extracts rich visual features while focusing on task-oriented changed information. A novel flow module is designed to refine building edge extraction and enhance the perception of changed buildings, mitigating noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation. The results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FAEWNet in accurately detecting building changes and improving edge recognition. <div>
arXiv:2504.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at https://github.com/SUPERMAN123000/FAEWNet.

Summary:  
The article introduces a neural network structure called FramePack for training models to predict the next frame in videos. FramePack compresses input frames to ensure a fixed transformer context length, allowing for efficient processing of a large number of frames using video diffusion. It also enables higher training video batch sizes, comparable to image diffusion training. The authors propose an anti-drifting sampling method to generate frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints, minimizing exposure bias. The study demonstrates that existing video diffusion models can be fine-tuned using FramePack, potentially enhancing visual quality by supporting more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps. <div>

Abstract: We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces TTOG, a two-stage trajectory generation framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. It addresses the challenge of integrating planning and motion tasks by generating trajectory candidates in the first stage and refining them using vehicle state information in the second stage. TTOG uses a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator to handle unavailable surrounding vehicle states and introduces ECSA for scene representation generalization across different agents. Experimental results show that TTOG achieves state-of-the-art performance in both planning and motion tasks. It outperforms existing baselines by reducing the L2 distance by 36.06% on the nuScenes dataset and improving the driving score (DS) by 22% on the Bench2Drive dataset. This approach highlights the benefits of integrating planning and motion tasks for enhanced autonomous driving capabilities. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years. Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework. In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states, TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by 36.06\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach achieves a 22\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Summary:<br />
Arabidopsis is a commonly used model plant for studying plant physiology and development. Live imaging is crucial for understanding plant growth processes, but accurate cell tracking is challenging, especially in densely packed cell arrangements. This study proposes a novel tracking method based on Genetic algorithm (GA) tailored to Arabidopsis root cellular patterns. The method involves a coarse-to-fine approach, first tracking nuclei at a line level and then refining tracking based on known cellular arrangements. Tested on Arabidopsis root tip imaging data, the method accurately tracks nuclei with minimal manual correction. This research represents a significant advancement in time-lapse microscopy for Arabidopsis root meristem studies, addressing a longstanding issue in the field. <div>

Abstract: Arabidopsis is a widely used model plant to gain basic knowledge on plant physiology and development. Live imaging is an important technique to visualize and quantify elemental processes in plant development. To uncover novel theories underlying plant growth and cell division, accurate cell tracking on live imaging is of utmost importance. The commonly used cell tracking software, TrackMate, adopts tracking-by-detection fashion, which applies Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) for blob detection, and Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) tracker for tracking. However, they do not perform sufficiently when cells are densely arranged. To alleviate the problems mentioned above, we propose an accurate tracking method based on Genetic algorithm (GA) using knowledge of Arabidopsis root cellular patterns and spatial relationship among volumes. Our method can be described as a coarse-to-fine method, in which we first conducted relatively easy line-level tracking of cell nuclei, then performed complicated nuclear tracking based on known linear arrangement of cell files and their spatial relationship between nuclei. Our method has been evaluated on a long-time live imaging dataset of Arabidopsis root tips, and with minor manual rectification, it accurately tracks nuclei. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first successful attempt to address a long-standing problem in the field of time-lapse microscopy in the root meristem by proposing an accurate tracking method for Arabidopsis root nuclei.

Abstract: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.

Abstract: Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection algorithms (MUAD) are receiving increasing attention due to their relatively low deployment costs and improved training efficiency. However, the real-world effectiveness of MUAD methods is questioned due to limitations in current Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) datasets. These datasets contain numerous classes that are unlikely to be produced by the same factory and fail to cover multiple structures or appearances. Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world characteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial Anomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of metallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts exhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that closely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for synthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this dataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory conditions. The dataset is available at https://github.com/Qiqigeww/HSS-IAD-Dataset.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models.

Abstract: Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when applied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics such as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

<div> keywords: CLIP, image-text, feature space, modality gap, zero-shot performance  
Summary:  
CLIP-Refine is introduced as a post-pre-training method for CLIP models to address the modality gap in multi-modal feature spaces. It aims to align image and text feature clusters with minimal training cost on small datasets without compromising zero-shot performance. The key techniques employed are random feature alignment (RaFA) to align features to a shared prior distribution and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD) to update the model using soft labels combining ground-truth labels and pre-trained model outputs. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate that CLIP-Refine successfully mitigates the modality gap and enhances zero-shot performance, enhancing the overall performance of vision-language models.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.

Summary:<br />
MaskMark is a framework for image watermarking with two variants: MaskMark-D for global watermark embedding and extraction, and MaskMark-ED for local embedding with enhanced robustness. It utilizes a masking mechanism during decoding for focused extraction, and a localization module for accurate identification of watermark regions. MaskMark-ED incorporates masking into the encoding stage for guiding the encoder to embed watermarks in designated local regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in global and local extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding compared to existing models like WAM. Additionally, it maintains high visual quality of watermarked images and is flexible to adjust robustness requirements. The approach is efficient, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with low computational cost compared to WAM. <div>

Abstract: We present MaskMark, a simple, efficient and flexible framework for image watermarking. MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global watermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for applications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local watermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions, enabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder- Distortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking mechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark extraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction, allowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A localization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark regions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and improving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask into the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in designated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark extraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and multi-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the recent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual quality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the distortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a few steps of fine-tuning. Moreover, our approach is efficient and easy to optimize, requiring only 20 hours on a single A6000 GPU with just 1/15 the computational cost of WAM.

Summary: 
The article discusses the advancements in diffusion models and personalization techniques that allow the recreation of individual portraits from limited images, raising privacy concerns due to the potential for realistic impersonations. Existing anti-personalization methods focus on adding perturbations to disrupt training but overlook the multi-image nature of personalization. The proposed Cross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP) framework introduces style consistency across perturbed images to enhance privacy protection against personalization attacks. Additionally, a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy is developed to balance the impact of consistency loss during attack iterations. Experimental results on CelebHQ and VGGFace2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CAP in improving privacy protection against personalization threats. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models and personalization techniques has made it possible to recreate individual portraits from just a few publicly available images. While such capabilities empower various creative applications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these threats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial perturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization models. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image nature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying perturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This neglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger privacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on privacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce Cross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances resistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed images. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy that adaptively balances the impact of the consistency loss throughout the attack iterations. Extensive experiments on the classical CelebHQ and VGGFace2 benchmarks show that CAP substantially improves existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects, counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.

Vision Foundation Models have shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation, but recent methods often neglect the stability of depth information compared to visual cues. This paper introduces DepthForge, a novel framework that integrates depth information with features from VFMs to enhance geometric consistency and generalization performance. DepthForge incorporates depth-aware learnable tokens in each layer of the VFMs to separate visual and spatial information, improving depth awareness. A depth refinement decoder refines VFM features and depth-aware tokens adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthForge outperforms alternative approaches, showing stronger performance, steadier attention, and superior generalization, especially in extreme conditions. Code for DepthForge is available on Github for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available at https://github.com/anonymouse-xzrptkvyqc/DepthForge.

Summary:<br /><br />This article introduces a new framework called ANT for ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models by preventing the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. ANT utilizes a trajectory-aware objective that guides the denoising process to avoid unwanted concepts while maintaining structural integrity.

For multi-concept erasure, ANT offers a versatile solution that enhances performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities. Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e., referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning. Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition, the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.

<div> Keywords: transparent surfaces, 3D reconstruction, Gaussian splatting, specular modeling, depth estimation.

Summary:
Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS) addresses the challenge of reconstructing transparent surfaces by separating geometry learning and appearance refinement. TSGS focuses on accurately representing surfaces in the geometry learning stage using specular-suppressed inputs. It then enhances visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling while maintaining opacity for geometric accuracy. TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method to improve depth inference, using a sliding window approach to pinpoint surface locations. The approach is evaluated using a TransLab dataset containing complex transparent objects and achieves both accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering simultaneously. TSGS outperforms current methods with a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset for TSGS will be made available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

Abstract: Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset will be released at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

<div> Keywords: watermark removal, digital content, SADRE framework, image restoration, robustness

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for robust watermark removal from digital content on the web. SADRE combines adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction to disrupt embedded watermarks while preserving essential image features. Guided by saliency masks, targeted noise is injected into latent representations, and a reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration. The framework offers stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations show SADRE's superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality compared to state-of-the-art watermarking techniques. SADRE sets a new benchmark for watermark elimination, providing a flexible and reliable solution for real-world web content. The code for SADRE is available on GitHub for implementation.

Abstract: As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world web content.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of 4D dynamic object generation in generative AI and introduces the TwoSquared method as a solution. With limited training data and high computing requirements, generating unseen geometry and movements poses challenges to models. TwoSquared addresses this by decomposing the problem into image-to-3D and physically inspired deformation modules. This method does not need templates or object-class-specific knowledge and can work with in-the-wild images. The experiments demonstrate TwoSquared's capability to produce texture-consistent and geometry-consistent 4D sequences using only two 2D images. <div>

Abstract: Despite the astonishing progress in generative AI, 4D dynamic object generation remains an open challenge. With limited high-quality training data and heavy computing requirements, the combination of hallucinating unseen geometry together with unseen movement poses great challenges to generative models. In this work, we propose TwoSquared as a method to obtain a 4D physically plausible sequence starting from only two 2D RGB images corresponding to the beginning and end of the action. Instead of directly solving the 4D generation problem, TwoSquared decomposes the problem into two steps: 1) an image-to-3D module generation based on the existing generative model trained on high-quality 3D assets, and 2) a physically inspired deformation module to predict intermediate movements. To this end, our method does not require templates or object-class-specific prior knowledge and can take in-the-wild images as input. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TwoSquared is capable of producing texture-consistent and geometry-consistent 4D sequences only given 2D images.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Summary:<br />
- GAN inversion techniques have excelled in image inpainting tasks but lack consistency between input and output. 
- MMInvertFill introduces a multimodal guided encoder with semantic segmentation for better structure enhancement.
- The F&amp;W+ latent space bridges the gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting, reducing color and semantic discrepancies.
- The Soft-update Mean Latent module captures diverse patterns for generating realistic textures in reconstructed images.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate MMInvertFill outperforms current methods, effectively completing out-of-domain images. <div>
arXiv:2504.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent performance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image texture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods usually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the realistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard constraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the same, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus degrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often consider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues in images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN inversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill contains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN generator with F&amp;W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to enhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge texture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a pre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To mitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we introduce the F&amp;W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and photorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent module to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating high-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the completion of out-of-domain images effectively.

Contemporary digital technology plays a crucial role in designing customized medical appliances such as occlusal splints for treating stomatognathic system dysfunctions. A novel approach is presented for computer-aided design and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging clinical concepts with current digital dental practices.

Abstract: Multispectral imaging plays a critical role in a range of intelligent transportation applications, including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), traffic monitoring, and night vision. However, accurate visible and thermal (RGB-T) image registration poses a significant challenge due to the considerable modality differences. In this paper, we present a novel joint Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF), leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore, it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).

<div> Implicit Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV), Tree-NeRV, video representation, temporal redundancy, rate-distortion performance

Summary: Tree-NeRV is a novel video representation method that utilizes a tree-structured feature representation organized within a Binary Search Tree (BST). This approach allows for non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis, optimizing compression efficiency and reconstruction quality by dynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal variation. Unlike existing NeRV-based methods that rely on uniform sampling, Tree-NeRV leverages temporal redundancy more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that Tree-NeRV outperforms prior methods in terms of compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. The proposed optimization-driven sampling strategy enhances adaptability and efficiency in video encoding processes, showcasing the benefits of Tree-NeRV in handling temporal variation and enhancing video representation capabilities.

arXiv:2504.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for video representation, enabling direct mappings from frame indices to video frames. However, existing NeRV-based methods do not fully exploit temporal redundancy, as they rely on uniform sampling along the temporal axis, leading to suboptimal rate-distortion (RD) performance. To address this limitation, we propose Tree-NeRV, a novel tree-structured feature representation for efficient and adaptive video encoding. Unlike conventional approaches, Tree-NeRV organizes feature representations within a Binary Search Tree (BST), enabling non-uniform sampling along the temporal axis. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven sampling strategy, dynamically allocating higher sampling density to regions with greater temporal variation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tree-NeRV achieves superior compression efficiency and reconstruction quality, outperforming prior uniform sampling-based methods. Code will be released.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, optimization, Levenberg-Marquardt, Conjugate Gradient, sparsity <br />
Summary:
The paper introduces a novel second-order optimization strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve training times. By leveraging the sparsity of the Jacobian in 3DGS, the proposed approach utilizes a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization, tailored specifically for Gaussian Splatting. Sampling strategies for camera views and loss functions are proposed to reduce computational complexity, along with an efficient heuristic for determining learning rates without costly line search methods. The method achieves a significant speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by up to six times for low Gaussian counts, while remaining competitive for moderate counts. Overall, the approach offers a more efficient and effective optimization strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a $3\times$ speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by $~6\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining competitive for moderate counts.

arXiv:2504.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, image compression for high-level vision tasks has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Given that object information in images plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background information, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream to selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these tasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning that the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of the encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant computations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional image as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to zero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent computations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an image compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism that encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image. Compared to existing semantic-structured compression methods, our approach can significantly reduce computational costs.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs, ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Abstract: We present GDFusion, a temporal fusion method for vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction (VisionOcc). GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework. To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory consumption by 27\%-72\%.

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps, it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic representation of the relations between categories through word vector distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision, yet collecting real-world defect images is inherently difficult due to the rarity and unpredictability of anomalies. Consequently, researchers have turned to synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.

Abstract: This study presents an ensemble-based approach for cocoa pod disease classification by integrating transfer learning with three ensemble learning strategies: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and Xception, were fine-tuned and employed as base learners to detect three disease categories: Black Pod Rot, Pod Borer, and Healthy. A balanced dataset of 6,000 cocoa pod images was curated and augmented to ensure robustness against variations in lighting, orientation, and disease severity. The performance of each ensemble method was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that Bagging consistently achieved superior classification performance with a test accuracy of 100%, outperforming Boosting (97%) and Stacking (92%). The findings confirm that combining transfer learning with ensemble techniques improves model generalization and reliability, making it a promising direction for precision agriculture and automated crop disease management.

Abstract: Efficiently transferring Learned Image Compression (LIC) model from human perception to machine perception is an emerging challenge in vision-centric representation learning. Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction, and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. To address these limitations, we propose an asymmetric adaptor framework that supports multi-task adaptation within a single model. Our method introduces a shared adaptor to learn general semantic features and task-specific adaptors to preserve task-level distinctions. With only lightweight plug-in modules and a frozen base codec, our method achieves strong performance across multiple tasks while maintaining compression efficiency. Experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines, and validating the effectiveness of multi-vision transferring.

Abstract: Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.

Abstract: We propose a method to transfer pose and expression between face images. Given a source and target face portrait, the model produces an output image in which the pose and expression of the source face image are transferred onto the target identity. The architecture consists of two encoders and a mapping network that projects the two inputs into the latent space of StyleGAN2, which finally generates the output. The training is self-supervised from video sequences of many individuals. Manual labeling is not required. Our model enables the synthesis of random identities with controllable pose and expression. Close-to-real-time performance is achieved.

Abstract: This paper introduces patch assignment flows for metric data labeling on graphs. Labelings are determined by regularizing initial local labelings through the dynamic interaction of both labels and label assignments across the graph, entirely encoded by a dictionary of competing labeled patches and mediated by patch assignment variables. Maximal consistency of patch assignments is achieved by geometric numerical integration of a Riemannian ascent flow, as critical point of a Lagrangian action functional. Experiments illustrate properties of the approach, including uncertainty quantification of label assignments.

<title>TTRD3: Texture Transfer Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13026</link>

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) reconstructs high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs to support fine-grained ground object interpretation. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1) Difficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS scenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in reconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and visual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First, a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse Texture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from reference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic reconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on multi-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared to best-performing baselines.

<title>Prototypes are Balanced Units for Efficient and Effective Partially Relevant Video Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13035</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing efficiency.

<title>Event-Enhanced Blurry Video Super-Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13042</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR), aiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and blurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high resolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient motion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in LR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR and propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse information from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a reciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from intra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global scene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to enhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module that fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame events and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable alignment process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Ev-DeblurVSR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, on real data, our method is +2.59 dB more accurate and 7.28$\times$ faster than the recent best BVSR baseline FMA-Net. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/Ev-DeblurVSR.

<title>Expert Kernel Generation Network Driven by Contextual Mapping for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13045</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more efficiently adapt to ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes EKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware mapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware mapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs into instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic kernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different types of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various dimensions. The mapping module and dynamic kernel generation mechanism form a tightly coupled system - the former generates meaningful combination weights based on inputs, while the latter constructs an adaptive expert convolution system using these weights. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on key spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on the fixed receptive field of a single static convolutional kernel. EKGNet enhances model representation capability through a 3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

<title>NoisyRollout: Reinforcing Visual Reasoning with Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing policy exploration to more effectively scale test-time compute remains underexplored in VLMs. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective RL approach that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images to introduce targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns. Without additional training cost, NoisyRollout enhances the exploration capabilities of VLMs by incorporating a vision-oriented inductive bias. Furthermore, NoisyRollout employs a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, ensuring benefit from noisy signals early while maintaining training stability and scalability in later stages. With just 2.1K training samples, NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models on 5 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning both reasoning and perception tasks, while preserving comparable or even better in-domain performance.

Abstract: In recent years smart glasses technology has rapidly advanced, opening up entirely new areas for mobile computing. We expect future smart glasses will need to be all-day wearable, adopting a small form factor to meet the requirements of volume, weight, fashionability and social acceptability, which puts significant constraints on the space of possible solutions. Additional challenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary environments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities. In this paper, we systematically analyze the space of imaging from smart glasses and derive several fundamental limits that govern this imaging domain. We discuss the impact of these limits on achievable image quality and camera module size -- comparing in particular to related devices such as mobile phones. We then propose a novel distributed imaging approach that allows to minimize the size of the individual camera modules when compared to a standard monolithic camera design. Finally, we demonstrate the properties of this novel approach in a series of experiments using synthetic data as well as images captured with two different prototype implementations.

<title>ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13061</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor is open-sourced at https://github.com/Jozenn/ArtistAuditor.

<title>EchoWorld: Learning Motion-Aware World Models for Echocardiography Probe Guidance</title>

Abstract: Echocardiography is crucial for cardiovascular disease detection but relies heavily on experienced sonographers. Echocardiography probe guidance systems, which provide real-time movement instructions for acquiring standard plane images, offer a promising solution for AI-assisted or fully autonomous scanning. However, developing effective machine learning models for this task remains challenging, as they must grasp heart anatomy and the intricate interplay between probe motion and visual signals. To address this, we present EchoWorld, a motion-aware world modeling framework for probe guidance that encodes anatomical knowledge and motion-induced visual dynamics, while effectively leveraging past visual-motion sequences to enhance guidance precision. EchoWorld employs a pre-training strategy inspired by world modeling principles, where the model predicts masked anatomical regions and simulates the visual outcomes of probe adjustments. Built upon this pre-trained model, we introduce a motion-aware attention mechanism in the fine-tuning stage that effectively integrates historical visual-motion data, enabling precise and adaptive probe guidance. Trained on more than one million ultrasound images from over 200 routine scans, EchoWorld effectively captures key echocardiographic knowledge, as validated by qualitative analysis. Moreover, our method significantly reduces guidance errors compared to existing visual backbones and guidance frameworks, excelling in both single-frame and sequential evaluation protocols. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/EchoWorld.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

arXiv:2504.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Computer vision is transforming fashion through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, on the other hand, extracts standardized garment images from clothed individuals. We introduce TryOffDiff, a diffusion-based VTOFF model. Built on a latent diffusion framework with SigLIP image conditioning, it effectively captures garment properties like texture, shape, and patterns. TryOffDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on VITON-HD and strong performance on DressCode dataset, covering upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. Enhanced with class-specific embeddings, it pioneers multi-garment VTOFF, the first of its kind. When paired with VTON models, it improves p2p-VTON by minimizing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin color. Code is available at: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

Abstract: This study conducts a detailed comparison of RF-DETR object detection base model and YOLOv12 object detection model configurations for detecting greenfruits in a complex orchard environment marked by label ambiguity, occlusions, and background blending. A custom dataset was developed featuring both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12 leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection, proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes. Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10 epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, YOLOv14, YOLOv15, YOLOE, YOLO World, YOLO, You Only Look Once, Roboflow, Detection Transformers, CNNs

Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a strong alternative to diffusion models, but existing inversion and editing methods designed for diffusion are often ineffective or inapplicable to them. The straight-line, non-crossing trajectories of flow models pose challenges for diffusion-based approaches but also open avenues for novel solutions. In this paper, we introduce a predictor-corrector-based framework for inversion and editing in flow models. First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of edit-irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of Uni-Inv and Uni-Edit, even under low-cost settings.

Abstract: The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI) framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for improving creative generation in VLMs.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

<title>Low-hallucination Synthetic Captions for Large-Scale Vision-Language Model Pre-training</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain. This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis. First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore, an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model. Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework, comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

<title>PCBEAR: Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13140</link>

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) has achieved impressive results with deep learning models, but their decision-making process remains opaque due to their black-box nature. Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for real-world applications requiring transparency and accountability. Existing video XAI methods primarily rely on feature attribution or static textual concepts, both of which struggle to capture motion dynamics and temporal dependencies essential for action understanding. To address these challenges, we propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR), a novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as motion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods based on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages human skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust and interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of pose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at individual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across multiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to video pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts without manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500, showing that it achieves high classification performance while offering interpretable, motion-driven explanations. Our method provides both strong predictive performance and human-understandable insights into the model's reasoning process, enabling test-time interventions for debugging and improving model behavior.

<title>$\texttt{Complex-Edit}$: CoT-Like Instruction Generation for Complexity-Controllable Image Editing Benchmark</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale. Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality; 3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction and point tracking in videos are typically treated as separate tasks, despite their deep connection. We propose St4RTrack, a feed-forward framework that simultaneously reconstructs and tracks dynamic video content in a world coordinate frame from RGB inputs. This is achieved by predicting two appropriately defined pointmaps for a pair of frames captured at different moments. Specifically, we predict both pointmaps at the same moment, in the same world, capturing both static and dynamic scene geometry while maintaining 3D correspondences. Chaining these predictions through the video sequence with respect to a reference frame naturally computes long-range correspondences, effectively combining 3D reconstruction with 3D tracking. Unlike prior methods that rely heavily on 4D ground truth supervision, we employ a novel adaptation scheme based on a reprojection loss. We establish a new extensive benchmark for world-frame reconstruction and tracking, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our unified, data-driven framework. Our code, model, and benchmark will be released.

<title>Training-Free Hierarchical Scene Understanding for Gaussian Splatting with Superpoint Graphs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13153</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging natural language and 3D geometry is a crucial step toward flexible, language-driven scene understanding. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\times$ faster. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Atrovast/THGS.

<title>AerialMegaDepth: Learning Aerial-Ground Reconstruction and View Synthesis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13157</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the task of geometric reconstruction of images captured from a mixture of ground and aerial views. Current state-of-the-art learning-based approaches fail to handle the extreme viewpoint variation between aerial-ground image pairs. Our hypothesis is that the lack of high-quality, co-registered aerial-ground datasets for training is a key reason for this failure. Such data is difficult to assemble precisely because it is difficult to reconstruct in a scalable way. To overcome this challenge, we propose a scalable framework combining pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes (e.g., Google Earth) with real, ground-level crowd-sourced images (e.g., MegaDepth). The pseudo-synthetic data simulates a wide range of aerial viewpoints, while the real, crowd-sourced images help improve visual fidelity for ground-level images where mesh-based renderings lack sufficient detail, effectively bridging the domain gap between real images and pseudo-synthetic renderings. Using this hybrid dataset, we fine-tune several state-of-the-art algorithms and achieve significant improvements on real-world, zero-shot aerial-ground tasks. For example, we observe that baseline DUSt3R localizes fewer than 5% of aerial-ground pairs within 5 degrees of camera rotation error, while fine-tuning with our data raises accuracy to nearly 56%, addressing a major failure point in handling large viewpoint changes. Beyond camera estimation and scene reconstruction, our dataset also improves performance on downstream tasks like novel-view synthesis in challenging aerial-ground scenarios, demonstrating the practical value of our approach in real-world applications.

Abstract: Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific subjects in diverse contexts. While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and image modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new direction for future research in this area.

Abstract: Creating a photorealistic scene and human reconstruction from a single monocular in-the-wild video figures prominently in the perception of a human-centric 3D world. Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

<title>Generate, but Verify: Reducing Hallucination in Vision-Language Models with Retrospective Resampling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13169</link>

arXiv:2504.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer from visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent objects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical applications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations. Our evaluations show that REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction, outperforming the best existing methods by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO and 28% on HaloQuest. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://reverse-vlm.github.io.

Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment-1, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance. The code and model are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGGarment-1.

<title>Single-Shot Shape and Reflectance with Spatial Polarization Multiplexing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region, which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data. The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the application of our method to dynamic surfaces.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models.

Abstract: We introduce Perception Encoder (PE), a state-of-the-art encoder for image and video understanding trained via simple vision-language learning. Traditionally, vision encoders have relied on a variety of pretraining objectives, each tailored to specific downstream tasks such as classification, captioning, or localization. Surprisingly, after scaling our carefully tuned image pretraining recipe and refining with our robust video data engine, we find that contrastive vision-language training alone can produce strong, general embeddings for all of these downstream tasks. There is only one caveat: these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods, language alignment for multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction. Together with the core contrastive checkpoint, our PE family of models achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&amp;A and spatial tasks such as detection, depth estimation, and tracking. To foster further research, we are releasing our models, code, and a novel dataset of synthetically and human-annotated videos.

Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work, we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version. The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data, and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

Abstract: Data curation plays a crucial role in training powerful Visual Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Metabolism and present our data-centric framework to build VLMs throughout the development lifecycle. Starting from a standard model architecture, we discuss and provide insights into two crucial development steps: data curation and iteration, forming a closed-loop system that continuously improves model performance. We show a detailed codebook on how to process existing massive datasets and build user-specific data flywheel. As a demonstration, we release a VLM, named Capybara-VL, which excels in typical multimodal tasks (e.g. , visual question answering, scientific reasoning, and text-rich tasks). Despite its relatively compact size, Capybara-VL surpasses several open-source models that are up to 10 times larger in size. Moreover, it achieves results that are on par with those of several leading proprietary models, demonstrating its remarkable competitiveness. These results highlight the power of our data-centric framework and the potential of training smaller and more efficient VLMs.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.

Abstract: There has been a continued trend towards minimizing instrumentation for full-body motion capture, going from specialized rooms and equipment, to arrays of worn sensors and recently sparse inertial pose capture methods. However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Abstract: Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm, learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across diverse control tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Humans can perceive and reason about spatial relationships from sequential visual observations, such as egocentric video streams. However, how pretrained models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks. Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.

Abstract: We present SOPHY, a generative model for 3D physics-aware shape synthesis. Unlike existing 3D generative models that focus solely on static geometry or 4D models that produce physics-agnostic animations, our approach jointly synthesizes shape, texture, and material properties related to physics-grounded dynamics, making the generated objects ready for simulations and interactive, dynamic environments. To train our model, we introduce a dataset of 3D objects annotated with detailed physical material attributes, along with an annotation pipeline for efficient material annotation. Our method enables applications such as text-driven generation of interactive, physics-aware 3D objects and single-image reconstruction of physically plausible shapes. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that jointly modeling shape and material properties enhances the realism and fidelity of generated shapes, improving performance on generative geometry evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.

Abstract: Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation, allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end, determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish, rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.

<title>UncAD: Towards Safe End-to-end Autonomous Driving via Online Map Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction, and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a 1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%. Codes, pre-trained models, and demo videos can be accessed at https://github.com/pengxuanyang/UncAD.

The software is implemented for scalability, interpretability, and ease of use, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets demonstrates the utility of ALT for diverse TSC tasks in physics and related domains.

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for achieving human-level robotic capabilities in manipulation tasks. VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these sensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing requirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the scale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and experimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of more capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physical environment.

Abstract: Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.

Abstract: Photorealistic avatars have become essential for immersive applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), enabling lifelike interactions in areas such as training simulations, telemedicine, and virtual collaboration. These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs, long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency, detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine. Our pipeline incorporates a novel Gaussian splatting technique with customized preprocessing that enables the user of "in the wild" monocular video capture, detailed facial expression reconstruction and embedding within a fully rigged avatar model. Additionally, we present a Unity-integrated Gaussian Splatting Avatar Editor, offering a user-friendly environment for VR/AR application development. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline in standardizing custom data for 3DGS training and demonstrate the versatility of Gaussian avatars in Unity, highlighting the scalability and practicality of our approach.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.

Abstract: Scene-level 3D generation represents a critical frontier in multimedia and computer graphics, yet existing approaches either suffer from limited object categories or lack editing flexibility for interactive applications. In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical "objects" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs.

Abstract: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks: (i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800 synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images, which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of 8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/lixinustc/KVQE- ChallengeCVPR-NTIRE2025.

Abstract: Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.

Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks hamper the decision-making ability of neural networks by perturbing the input signal. The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/UDASS.

Abstract: Modern text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can generate images with remarkable realism and creativity. These advancements have sparked research in fake image detection and attribution, yet prior studies have not fully explored the practical and scientific dimensions of this task. In addition to attributing images to 12 state-of-the-art T2I generators, we provide extensive analyses on what inference stage hyperparameters and image modifications are discernible. Our experiments reveal that initialization seeds are highly detectable, along with other subtle variations in the image generation process to some extent. We further investigate what visual traces are leveraged in image attribution by perturbing high-frequency details and employing mid-level representations of image style and structure. Notably, altering high-frequency information causes only slight reductions in accuracy, and training an attributor on style representations outperforms training on RGB images. Our analyses underscore that fake images are detectable and attributable at various levels of visual granularity.

<title>QMix: Quality-aware Learning with Mixed Noise for Robust Retinal Disease Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Due to the complexity of medical image acquisition and the difficulty of annotation, medical image datasets inevitably contain noise. Noisy data with wrong labels affects the robustness and generalization ability of deep neural networks. Previous noise learning methods mainly considered noise arising from images being mislabeled, i.e. label noise, assuming that all mislabeled images are of high image quality. However, medical images are prone to suffering extreme quality issues, i.e. data noise, where discriminative visual features are missing for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a noise learning framework, termed as QMix, that learns a robust disease diagnosis model under mixed noise. QMix alternates between sample separation and quality-aware semisupervised training in each training epoch. In the sample separation phase, we design a joint uncertainty-loss criterion to effectively separate (1) correctly labeled images; (2) mislabeled images with high quality and (3) mislabeled images with low quality. In the semi-supervised training phase, we train a disease diagnosis model to learn robust feature representation from the separated samples. Specifically, we devise a sample-reweighing loss to mitigate the effect of mislabeled images with low quality during training. Meanwhile, a contrastive enhancement loss is proposed to further distinguish mislabeled images with low quality from correctly labeled images. QMix achieved state-of-the-art disease diagnosis performance on five public retinal image datasets and exhibited substantial improvement on robustness against mixed noise.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across multiple disciplines due to their exceptional instruction-following capabilities and extensive world knowledge. However, whether these MLLMs possess human-like compositional reasoning abilities remains an open problem. To unveil their reasoning behaviors, we first curate a \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}ssumptive \textbf{R}ea\textbf{s}oning Benchmark (MARS-Bench) in this paper. Interestingly, we find that most prevalent MLLMs can be easily fooled by the introduction of a presupposition into the question, whereas such presuppositions appear naive to human reasoning. Besides, we also propose a simple yet effective method, Active Deduction (AD), a novel reinforcement learning paradigm to encourage the model to actively perform composite deduction before reaching a final decision. Equipped with the proposed AD method, a MLLM demonstrates significant improvements in assumptive reasoning abilities without compromising its general-purpose question-answering performance. We also provide extensive evaluations of both open-source and private MLLMs on MARS-Bench, along with experimental analyses of the AD method.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have facilitated creative and photorealistic image synthesis. By varying the random seeds, we can generate many images for a fixed text prompt. Technically, the seed controls the initial noise and, in multi-step diffusion inference, the noise used for reparameterization at intermediate timesteps in the reverse diffusion process. However, the specific impact of the random seed on the generated images remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale scientific study into the impact of random seeds during diffusion inference. Remarkably, we reveal that the best 'golden' seed achieved an impressive FID of 21.60, compared to the worst 'inferior' seed's FID of 31.97. Additionally, a classifier can predict the seed number used to generate an image with over 99.9% accuracy in just a few epochs, establishing that seeds are highly distinguishable based on generated images. Encouraged by these findings, we examined the influence of seeds on interpretable visual dimensions. We find that certain seeds consistently produce grayscale images, prominent sky regions, or image borders. Seeds also affect image composition, including object location, size, and depth. Moreover, by leveraging these 'golden' seeds, we demonstrate improved image generation such as high-fidelity inference and diversified sampling. Our investigation extends to inpainting tasks, where we uncover some seeds that tend to insert unwanted text artifacts. Overall, our extensive analyses highlight the importance of selecting good seeds and offer practical utility for image generation.

<title>Visually Consistent Hierarchical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical classification predicts labels across multiple levels of a taxonomy, e.g., from coarse-level 'Bird' to mid-level 'Hummingbird' to fine-level 'Green hermit', allowing flexible recognition under varying visual conditions. It is commonly framed as multiple single-level tasks, but each level may rely on different visual cues: Distinguishing 'Bird' from 'Plant' relies on global features like feathers or leaves, while separating 'Anna's hummingbird' from 'Green hermit' requires local details such as head coloration. Prior methods improve accuracy using external semantic supervision, but such statistical learning criteria fail to ensure consistent visual grounding at test time, resulting in incorrect hierarchical classification. We propose, for the first time, to enforce internal visual consistency by aligning fine-to-coarse predictions through intra-image segmentation. Our method outperforms zero-shot CLIP and state-of-the-art baselines on hierarchical classification benchmarks, achieving both higher accuracy and more consistent predictions. It also improves internal image segmentation without requiring pixel-level annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve remarkable accuracy in computer vision tasks, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples--carefully crafted perturbations to input images that can deceive these models into making confident but incorrect predictions. This vulnerability pose significant risks in high-stakes applications such as autonomous vehicles, security surveillance, and safety-critical inspection systems. While the existing literature extensively covers adversarial attacks in image classification, comprehensive analyses of such attacks on object detection systems remain limited. This paper presents a novel taxonomic framework for categorizing adversarial attacks specific to object detection architectures, synthesizes existing robustness metrics, and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on popular object detection models, including both traditional detectors and modern detectors with vision-language pretraining. Through rigorous analysis of open-source attack implementations and their effectiveness across diverse detection architectures, we derive key insights into attack characteristics. Furthermore, we delineate critical research gaps and emerging challenges to guide future investigations in securing object detection systems against adversarial threats. Our findings establish a foundation for developing more robust detection models while highlighting the urgent need for standardized evaluation protocols in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: We introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel self-supervised training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model. Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e., 'attract' and 'repel', this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +5.5% and +6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.

Abstract: Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.

Abstract: Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decisionmaking and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study Grounded TextVideoQA by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scenetext recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, e.g., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset ViTXT-GQA which features 52K scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2K temporal segments related to 2K questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition.

Abstract: Evidence-based deep learning represents a burgeoning paradigm for uncertainty estimation, offering reliable predictions with negligible extra computational overheads. Existing methods usually adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence to estimate the uncertainty of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps among various modalities. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel algorithm based on H\"older Divergence (HD) to enhance the reliability of multi-view learning by addressing inherent uncertainty challenges from incomplete or noisy data. Generally, our method extracts the representations of multiple modalities through parallel network branches, and then employs HD to estimate the prediction uncertainties. Through the Dempster-Shafer theory, integration of uncertainty from different modalities, thereby generating a comprehensive result that considers all available representations. Mathematically, HD proves to better measure the ``distance'' between real data distribution and predictive distribution of the model and improve the performances of multi-class recognition tasks.
  Specifically, our method surpass the existing state-of-the-art counterparts on all evaluating benchmarks.
  We further conduct extensive experiments on different backbones to verify our superior robustness. It is demonstrated that our method successfully pushes the corresponding performance boundaries. Finally, we perform experiments on more challenging scenarios, \textit{i.e.}, learning with incomplete or noisy data, revealing that our method exhibits a high tolerance to such corrupted data.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based bi-modal salient object detection (BSOD) aims to segment salient objects in a scene utilizing complementary cues in unaligned RGB and thermal image pairs. However, the high computational expense of existing UAV-based BSOD models limits their applicability to real-world UAV devices. To address this problem, we propose an efficient Fourier filter network with contrastive learning that achieves both real-time and accurate performance. Specifically, we first design a semantic contrastive alignment loss to align the two modalities at the semantic level, which facilitates mutual refinement in a parameter-free way. Second, inspired by the fast Fourier transform that obtains global relevance in linear complexity, we propose synchronized alignment fusion, which aligns and fuses bi-modal features in the channel and spatial dimensions by a hierarchical filtering mechanism. Our proposed model, AlignSal, reduces the number of parameters by 70.0%, decreases the floating point operations by 49.4%, and increases the inference speed by 152.5% compared to the cutting-edge BSOD model (i.e., MROS). Extensive experiments on the UAV RGB-T 2400 and seven bi-modal dense prediction datasets demonstrate that AlignSal achieves both real-time inference speed and better performance and generalizability compared to nineteen state-of-the-art models across most evaluation metrics. In addition, our ablation studies further verify AlignSal's potential in boosting the performance of existing aligned BSOD models on UAV-based unaligned data. The code is available at: https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/AlignSal.

Abstract: This paper presents ViTOC (Vision Transformer and Object-aware Captioner), a novel vision-language model for image captioning that addresses the challenges of accuracy and diversity in generated descriptions. Unlike conventional approaches, ViTOC employs a dual-path architecture based on Vision Transformer and object detector, effectively fusing global visual features and local object information through learnable vectors. The model introduces an innovative object-aware prompting strategy that significantly enhances its capability in handling long-tail data. Experiments on the standard COCO dataset demonstrate that ViTOC outperforms baseline models across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation method based on CLIP to further validate the model's effectiveness. By utilizing pretrained visual model parameters, ViTOC achieves efficient end-to-end training.

Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXLSTM, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: AI-driven video generation techniques have made significant progress in recent years. However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions. First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 6,000 AGVs derived from 15 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities. We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts. Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities. Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs. GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs. The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs. The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released publicly.

Abstract: We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales. We showcase flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models. Code, model, and data will be released.

Abstract: Long video understanding presents challenges due to the inherent high computational complexity and redundant temporal information. An effective representation for long videos must efficiently process such redundancy while preserving essential contents for downstream tasks. This paper introduces SEmantic Attention Learning (SEAL), a novel unified representation for long videos. To reduce computational complexity, long videos are decomposed into three distinct types of semantic entities: scenes, objects, and actions, allowing models to operate on a compact set of entities rather than a large number of frames or pixels. To further address redundancy, we propose an attention learning module that balances token relevance with diversity, formulated as a subset selection optimization problem. Our representation is versatile and applicable across various long video understanding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks across diverse benchmarks, including LVBench, MovieChat-1K, and Ego4D.

<title>UMSPU: Universal Multi-Size Phase Unwrapping via Mutual Self-Distillation and Adaptive Boosting Ensemble Segmenters</title>

Abstract: Spatial phase unwrapping is a key technique for extracting phase information to obtain 3D morphology and other features. Modern industrial measurement scenarios demand high precision, large image sizes, and high speed. However, conventional methods struggle with noise resistance and processing speed. Current deep learning methods are limited by the receptive field size and sparse semantic information, making them ineffective for large size images. To address this issue, we propose a mutual self-distillation (MSD) mechanism and adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters to construct a universal multi-size phase unwrapping network (UMSPU). MSD performs hierarchical attention refinement and achieves cross-layer collaborative learning through bidirectional distillation, ensuring fine-grained semantic representation across image sizes. The adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters combine weak segmenters with different receptive fields into a strong one, ensuring stable segmentation across spatial frequencies. Experimental results show that UMSPU overcomes image size limitations, achieving high precision across image sizes ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048 (an 8 times increase). It also outperforms existing methods in speed, robustness, and generalization. Its practicality is further validated in structured light imaging and InSAR. We believe that UMSPU offers a universal solution for phase unwrapping, with broad potential for industrial applications.

Abstract: The use of large-scale, web-scraped datasets to train face recognition models has raised significant privacy and bias concerns. Synthetic methods mitigate these concerns and provide scalable and controllable face generation to enable fair and accurate face recognition. However, existing synthetic datasets display limited intraclass and interclass diversity and do not match the face recognition performance obtained using real datasets. Here, we propose VariFace, a two-stage diffusion-based pipeline to create fair and diverse synthetic face datasets to train face recognition models. Specifically, we introduce three methods: Face Recognition Consistency to refine demographic labels, Face Vendi Score Guidance to improve interclass diversity, and Divergence Score Conditioning to balance the identity preservation-intraclass diversity trade-off. When constrained to the same dataset size, VariFace considerably outperforms previous synthetic datasets (0.9200 $\rightarrow$ 0.9405) and achieves comparable performance to face recognition models trained with real data (Real Gap = -0.0065). In an unconstrained setting, VariFace not only consistently achieves better performance compared to previous synthetic methods across dataset sizes but also, for the first time, outperforms the real dataset (CASIA-WebFace) across six evaluation datasets. This sets a new state-of-the-art performance with an average face verification accuracy of 0.9567 (Real Gap = +0.0097) across LFW, CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW datasets and 0.9366 (Real Gap = +0.0380) on the RFW dataset.

Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical probabilistic approach to go from a 2D image to multiview 3D: a diffusion "prior" predicts the unseen 3D geometry, which then conditions a diffusion "decoder" to generate novel views of the subject. We use a pointmap-based geometric representation to coordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We construct a predictable distribution of geometric features per target view to enable learnability across examples, and generalization to arbitrary inputs images. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to novel-view synthesis (called "unPIC") beats competing baselines such as CAT3D, EscherNet, Free3D, and One-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as unseen real-world objects from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, and the Digital Twin Catalog.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly progressed in offline video understanding. However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features 6 core task types across three temporal contexts-past, current, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy. % Our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art offline models Qwen2-VL 7B and online models Flash-VStream, by 4.19% and 23.7% on OVBench, respectively.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in text-guided style transfer, primarily attributed to innovations in diffusion models. These models excel in conditional guidance, utilizing text or images to direct the sampling process. However, despite their capabilities, direct conditional guidance approaches often face challenges in balancing the expressiveness of textual semantics with the diversity of output results while capturing stylistic features. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtCrafter, a novel framework for text-to-image style transfer. Specifically, we introduce an attention-based style extraction module, meticulously engineered to capture the subtle stylistic elements within an image. This module features a multi-layer architecture that leverages the capabilities of perceiver attention mechanisms to integrate fine-grained information. Additionally, we present a novel text-image aligning augmentation component that adeptly balances control over both modalities, enabling the model to efficiently map image and text embeddings into a shared feature space. We achieve this through attention operations that enable smooth information flow between modalities. Lastly, we incorporate an explicit modulation that seamlessly blends multimodal enhanced embeddings with original embeddings through an embedding reframing design, empowering the model to generate diverse outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtCrafter yields impressive results in visual stylization, exhibiting exceptional levels of stylistic intensity, controllability, and diversity.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news videos are difficult to interpret because they require comprehensive consideration of the correlation and consistency between multiple modes. Existing methods deal with fake news videos as a classification problem, but it's not clear why news videos are identified as fake. Without proper explanation, the end user may not understand the underlying meaning of the falsehood. Therefore, we propose a new problem - Fake news video Explanation (FNVE) - given a multimodal news post containing a video and title, our goal is to generate natural language explanations to reveal the falsity of the news video. To that end, we developed FakeVE, a new dataset of 2,672 fake news video posts that can definitively explain four real-life fake news video aspects. In order to understand the characteristics of fake news video explanation, we conducted an exploratory analysis of FakeVE from different perspectives. In addition, we propose a Multimodal Relation Graph Transformer (MRGT) based on the architecture of multimodal Transformer to benchmark FakeVE. The empirical results show that the results of the various benchmarks (adopted by FakeVE) are convincing and provide a detailed analysis of the differences in explanation generation of the benchmark models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.

Abstract: 3D open-world classification is a challenging yet essential task in dynamic and unstructured real-world scenarios, requiring both open-category and open-pose recognition. To address these challenges, recent wisdom often takes sophisticated 2D pre-trained models to provide enriched and stable representations. However, these methods largely rely on how 3D objects can be projected into 2D space, which is unfortunately not well solved, and thus significantly limits their performance. Unlike these present efforts, in this paper we make a pioneering exploration of 3D generative models for 3D open-world classification. Drawing on abundant prior knowledge from 3D generative models, we additionally craft a rotation-invariant feature extractor. This innovative synergy endows our pipeline with the advantages of being training-free, open-category, and pose-invariant, thus well suited to 3D open-world classification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the potential of generative models in 3D open-world classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet10 and McGill with 32.0% and 8.7% overall accuracy improvement, respectively.

Abstract: After pre-training on extensive image-text pairs, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates promising performance on a wide variety of benchmarks. However, a substantial volume of multimodal interleaved documents remains underutilized for contrastive vision-language representation learning. To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts. Based on these innovations, we construct RealSyn, a dataset combining realistic and synthetic texts, available in three scales: 15M, 30M, and 100M. We compare our dataset with other widely used datasets of equivalent scale for CLIP training. Models pre-trained on RealSyn consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including linear probe, zero-shot transfer, zero-shot robustness, and zero-shot retrieval. Furthermore, extensive experiments confirm that RealSyn significantly enhances contrastive vision-language representation learning and demonstrates robust scalability. To facilitate future research, the RealSyn dataset and pretrained model weights are released at https://github.com/deepglint/RealSyn.

Abstract: Geolocation, the task of identifying an image's location, requires complex reasoning and is crucial for navigation, monitoring, and cultural preservation. However, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable localization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing geolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and automatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task difficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack sufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components: GeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval, an evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and drive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is GeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from a geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises 25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much of the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of times by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed analysis and highlights key gaps in current models. Building on this dataset, we propose Geographical Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT), a novel multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision Models (LVMs) in geolocation tasks. GeoCoT improves performance by integrating contextual and spatial cues through a multi-step process that mimics human geolocation reasoning. Finally, using the GeoEval metric, we demonstrate that GeoCoT significantly boosts geolocation accuracy by up to 25% while enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/CoDiff

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new class knowledge while retaining previous classes, facilitating adaptation and evolution in dynamic, real-world environments. Traditional CIL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, VLMs show promising potential for enhancing CIL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and integrating multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Calibration Enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) framework. Specifically, FCPS introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism that iteratively calibrates the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thus preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, parameter integration enables effective knowledge transfer, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

Abstract: The robustness of DNNs is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.

Abstract: Neural representations for video (NeRV) have gained considerable attention for their strong performance across various video tasks. However, existing NeRV methods often struggle to capture fine spatial details, resulting in vague reconstructions. In this paper, we present a Frequency Separation and Augmentation based Neural Representation for video (FANeRV), which addresses these limitations with its core Wavelet Frequency Upgrade Block. This block explicitly separates input frames into high and low-frequency components using discrete wavelet transform, followed by targeted enhancement using specialized modules. Finally, a specially designed gated network effectively fuses these frequency components for optimal reconstruction. Additionally, convolutional residual enhancement blocks are integrated into the later stages of the network to balance parameter distribution and improve the restoration of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FANeRV significantly improves reconstruction performance and excels in multiple tasks, including video compression, inpainting, and interpolation, outperforming existing NeRV methods.

Abstract: 360{\deg} videos have emerged as a promising medium to represent our dynamic visual world. Compared to the "tunnel vision" of standard cameras, their borderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our surroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos, their ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the task of video-to-360{\deg} generation: given a perspective video as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is consistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks, the output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required to have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the dynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we first leverage the abundant 360{\deg} videos available online and develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training data. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware operations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of 360{\deg} video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate realistic and coherent 360{\deg} videos from in-the-wild perspective video. In addition, we showcase its potential applications, including video stabilization, camera viewpoint control, and interactive visual question answering.

Abstract: Transvaginal ultrasound is a critical imaging modality for evaluating cervical anatomy and detecting physiological changes. However, accurate segmentation of cervical structures remains challenging due to low contrast, shadow artifacts, and indistinct boundaries. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated efficacy in medical image segmentation, their reliance on large-scale annotated datasets presents a significant limitation in clinical ultrasound imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a potential solution by utilizing unlabeled data, yet existing teacher-student frameworks often encounter confirmation bias and high computational costs. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework, called HDC, is proposed incorporating adaptive consistency learning with a single-teacher architecture. The framework introduces a hierarchical distillation mechanism with two objectives: Correlation Guidance Loss for aligning feature representations and Mutual Information Loss for stabilizing noisy student learning. The proposed approach reduces model complexity while enhancing generalization. Experiments on fetal ultrasound datasets, FUGC and PSFH, demonstrate competitive performance with reduced computational overhead compared to multi-teacher models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes from a limited set of training samples without forgetting knowledge of previously learned classes. Conventional FSCIL methods typically build a robust feature extractor during the base training session with abundant training samples and subsequently freeze this extractor, only fine-tuning the classifier in subsequent incremental phases. However, current strategies primarily focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, considering only the relationship between novel and base classes, without paying attention to the specific decision spaces of each class. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play Adaptive Decision Boundary Strategy (ADBS), which is compatible with most FSCIL methods. Specifically, we assign a specific decision boundary to each class and adaptively adjust these boundaries during training to optimally refine the decision spaces for the classes in each session. Furthermore, to amplify the distinctiveness between classes, we employ a novel inter-class constraint loss that optimizes the decision boundaries and prototypes for each class. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200, demonstrate that incorporating our ADBS method with existing FSCIL techniques significantly improves performance, achieving overall state-of-the-art results.

<title>CAP-Net: A Unified Network for 6D Pose and Size Estimation of Categorical Articulated Parts from a Single RGB-D Image</title>

Abstract: This paper tackles category-level pose estimation of articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks and introduces a new benchmark dataset. While recent methods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for estimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified network to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Real-world deployments of our model in robotic tasks underscore its robustness and exceptional sim-to-real transfer capabilities, confirming its substantial practical utility. Our dataset, code and pre-trained models are available on the project page.

Abstract: Efficiently capturing multi-scale information and building long-range dependencies among pixels are essential for medical image segmentation because of the various sizes and shapes of the lesion regions or organs. In this paper, we present Multi-scale Cross-axis Attention (MCA) to solve the above challenging issues based on the efficient axial attention. Instead of simply connecting axial attention along the horizontal and vertical directions sequentially, we propose to calculate dual cross attentions between two parallel axial attentions to capture global information better. To process the significant variations of lesion regions or organs in individual sizes and shapes, we also use multiple convolutions of strip-shape kernels with different kernel sizes in each axial attention path to improve the efficiency of the proposed MCA in encoding spatial information. We build the proposed MCA upon the MSCAN backbone, yielding our network, termed MCANet. Our MCANet with only 4M+ parameters performs even better than most previous works with heavy backbones (e.g., Swin Transformer) on four challenging tasks, including skin lesion segmentation, nuclei segmentation, abdominal multi-organ segmentation, and polyp segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/haoshao-nku/medical_seg.

Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.

<title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>

Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .

Abstract: Spatial expressions in situated communication can be ambiguous, as their meanings vary depending on the frames of reference (FoR) adopted by speakers and listeners. While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.

<title>Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem</title>

Abstract: Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.

Abstract: Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have significantly advanced semi-supervised learning (SSL). Prior works have effectively employed Mixup for consistency regularization in SSL. However, our findings indicate that applying Mixup for consistency regularization may degrade SSL performance by compromising the purity of artificial labels. Moreover, most pseudo-labeling based methods utilize thresholding strategy to exclude low-confidence data, aiming to mitigate confirmation bias; however, this approach limits the utility of unlabeled samples. To address these challenges, we propose RegMixMatch, a novel framework that optimizes the use of Mixup with both high- and low-confidence samples in SSL. First, we introduce semi-supervised RegMixup, which effectively addresses reduced artificial labels purity by using both mixed samples and clean samples for training. Second, we develop a class-aware Mixup technique that integrates information from the top-2 predicted classes into low-confidence samples and their artificial labels, reducing the confirmation bias associated with these samples and enhancing their effective utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that RegMixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL benchmarks.

Abstract: Prototype-based classification learning methods are known to be inherently interpretable. However, this paradigm suffers from major limitations compared to deep models, such as lower performance. This led to the development of the so-called deep Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs), also known as prototypical parts models. In this work, we analyze these models with respect to different properties, including interpretability. In particular, we focus on the Classification-by-Components (CBC) approach, which uses a probabilistic model to ensure interpretability and can be used as a shallow or deep architecture. We show that this model has several shortcomings, like creating contradicting explanations. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of CBC that solves these issues. Moreover, we prove that this extension has robustness guarantees and derive a loss that optimizes robustness. Additionally, our analysis shows that most (deep) PBNs are related to (deep) RBF classifiers, which implies that our robustness guarantees generalize to shallow RBF classifiers. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our deep PBN yields state-of-the-art classification accuracy on different benchmarks while resolving the interpretability shortcomings of other approaches. Further, our shallow PBN variant outperforms other shallow PBNs while being inherently interpretable and exhibiting provable robustness guarantees.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.

Abstract: We introduce methods for obtaining pretrained Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) that can serve as basal foundation models for use in obtaining geometric features. These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We release codes and weights for using GNPs in the package geo_neural_op. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction garners increasing attention alongside the advancement of high-level image applications, where dense stereo matching (DSM) serves as a pivotal technique. Previous studies often rely on publicly available datasets for training, focusing on modifying network architectures or incorporating specialized modules to extract domain-invariant features and thus improve model robustness. In contrast, inspired by single-frame structured-light phase-shifting encoding, this study introduces RGB-Speckle, a cross-scene 3D reconstruction framework based on an active stereo camera system, designed to enhance robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding method: first, we randomly perturb phase-shift maps and embed them into the three RGB channels to generate color speckle patterns; subsequently, the camera captures phase-encoded images modulated by objects as input to a stereo matching network. This technique effectively mitigates external interference and ensures consistent input data for RGB-Speckle, thereby bolstering cross-domain 3D reconstruction stability. To validate the proposed method, we conduct complex experiments: (1) construct a color speckle dataset for complex scenarios based on the proposed encoding scheme; (2) evaluate the impact of the phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding technique on 3D reconstruction accuracy; and (3) further investigate its robustness across diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RGB-Speckle model offers significant advantages in cross-domain and cross-scene 3D reconstruction tasks, enhancing model generalization and reinforcing robustness in challenging environments, thus providing a novel solution for robust 3D reconstruction research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.

<title>StrokeFusion: Vector Sketch Generation via Joint Stroke-UDF Encoding and Latent Sequence Diffusion</title>

arXiv:2503.23752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce non-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a holistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability. Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.

Abstract: In this study, we present our methodology for two tasks: the Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) Recognition Challenge and the Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation Challenge, both conducted as part of the 8th Workshop and Competition on Affective & Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Building on previous work, we utilize a Wav2Vec 2.0 model pre-trained on a large podcast dataset to extract various audio features, capturing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. Our approach incorporates a valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module derived from Wav2Vec 2.0, a BERT-like encoder, and a vision transformer (ViT) with predictions subsequently processed through a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for temporal modeling. In this iteration, we integrate the textual and visual modality into our analysis, recognizing that semantic content provides valuable contextual cues and underscoring that the meaning of speech often conveys more critical insights than its acoustic counterpart alone. Fusing in the vision modality helps in some cases to interpret the textual modality more precisely. This combined approach yields significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

Abstract: The advancement of technology has revolutionised the agricultural industry, transitioning it from labour-intensive farming practices to automated, AI-powered management systems. In recent years, more intelligent livestock monitoring solutions have been proposed to enhance farming efficiency and productivity. This work presents a novel approach to animal activity recognition and movement tracking, leveraging tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques, wireless communication framework, and microcontroller platforms to develop an efficient, cost-effective livestock sensing system. It collects and fuses accelerometer data and vision inputs to build a multi-modal network for three tasks: image classification, object detection, and behaviour recognition. The system is deployed and evaluated on commercial microcontrollers for real-time inference using embedded applications, demonstrating up to 270$\times$ model size reduction, less than 80ms response latency, and on-par performance comparable to existing methods. The incorporation of the TinyML technique allows for seamless data transmission between devices, benefiting use cases in remote locations with poor Internet connectivity. This work delivers a robust, scalable IoT-edge livestock monitoring solution adaptable to diverse farming needs, offering flexibility for future extensions.

<title>SO-DETR: Leveraging Dual-Domain Features and Knowledge Distillation for Small Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Detection Transformer-based methods have achieved significant advancements in general object detection. However, challenges remain in effectively detecting small objects. One key difficulty is that existing encoders struggle to efficiently fuse low-level features. Additionally, the query selection strategies are not effectively tailored for small objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient model, Small Object Detection Transformer (SO-DETR). The model comprises three key components: a dual-domain hybrid encoder, an enhanced query selection mechanism, and a knowledge distillation strategy. The dual-domain hybrid encoder integrates spatial and frequency domains to fuse multi-scale features effectively. This approach enhances the representation of high-resolution features while maintaining relatively low computational overhead. The enhanced query selection mechanism optimizes query initialization by dynamically selecting high-scoring anchor boxes using expanded IoU, thereby improving the allocation of query resources. Furthermore, by incorporating a lightweight backbone network and implementing a knowledge distillation strategy, we develop an efficient detector for small objects. Experimental results on the VisDrone-2019-DET and UAVVaste datasets demonstrate that SO-DETR outperforms existing methods with similar computational demands.

<title>High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging for Robust Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11472</link>

Abstract: Object detection precision is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of autonomous driving systems. The quality of acquired images directly influences the ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real environments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation problems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection. Traditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their ability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for multiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work introduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection. The modulo sensor allows pixels to `reset/wrap' upon reaching saturation level by acquiring an irradiance encoding image which can then be recovered using unwrapping algorithms. The applied reconstruction techniques enable HDR recovery of color intensity and image details, ensuring better visual quality even under extreme lighting conditions at the cost of extra time. Experiments with the YOLOv10 model demonstrate that images processed using modulo images achieve performance comparable to HDR images and significantly surpass saturated images in terms of object detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed modulo imaging step combined with HDR image reconstruction is shorter than the time required for conventional HDR image acquisition.

Abstract: Humans can make moral inferences from multiple sources of input. In contrast, automated moral inference in artificial intelligence typically relies on language models with textual input. However, morality is conveyed through modalities beyond language. We present a computational framework that supports moral inference from natural images, demonstrated in two related tasks: 1) inferring human moral judgment toward visual images and 2) analyzing patterns in moral content communicated via images from public news. We find that models based on text alone cannot capture the fine-grained human moral judgment toward visual stimuli, but language-vision fusion models offer better precision in visual moral inference. Furthermore, applications of our framework to news data reveal implicit biases in news categories and geopolitical discussions. Our work creates avenues for automating visual moral inference and discovering patterns of visual moral communication in public media.

<title>SDIGLM: Leveraging Large Language Models and Multi-Modal Chain of Thought for Structural Damage Identification</title>

Abstract: Existing computer vision(CV)-based structural damage identification models demonstrate notable accuracy in categorizing and localizing damage. However, these models present several critical limitations that hinder their practical application in civil engineering(CE). Primarily, their ability to recognize damage types remains constrained, preventing comprehensive analysis of the highly varied and complex conditions encountered in real-world CE structures. Second, these models lack linguistic capabilities, rendering them unable to articulate structural damage characteristics through natural language descriptions. With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence(AI), large multi-modal models(LMMs) have emerged as a transformative solution, enabling the unified encoding and alignment of textual and visual data. These models can autonomously generate detailed descriptive narratives of structural damage while demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenarios and tasks. This study introduces SDIGLM, an innovative LMM for structural damage identification, developed based on the open-source VisualGLM-6B architecture. To address the challenge of adapting LMMs to the intricate and varied operating conditions in CE, this work integrates a U-Net-based semantic segmentation module to generate defect segmentation maps as visual Chain of Thought(CoT). Additionally, a multi-round dialogue fine-tuning dataset is constructed to enhance logical reasoning, complemented by a language CoT formed through prompt engineering. By leveraging this multi-modal CoT, SDIGLM surpasses general-purpose LMMs in structural damage identification, achieving an accuracy of 95.24% across various infrastructure types. Moreover, the model effectively describes damage characteristics such as hole size, crack direction, and corrosion severity.

<title>Flux Already Knows - Activating Subject-Driven Image Generation without Training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective zero-shot framework for subject-driven image generation using a vanilla Flux model. By framing the task as grid-based image completion and simply replicating the subject image(s) in a mosaic layout, we activate strong identity-preserving capabilities without any additional data, training, or inference-time fine-tuning. This "free lunch" approach is further strengthened by a novel cascade attention design and meta prompting technique, boosting fidelity and versatility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines across multiple key metrics in benchmarks and human preference studies, with trade-offs in certain aspects. Additionally, it supports diverse edits, including logo insertion, virtual try-on, and subject replacement or insertion. These results demonstrate that a pre-trained foundational text-to-image model can enable high-quality, resource-efficient subject-driven generation, opening new possibilities for lightweight customization in downstream applications.

<title>snnTrans-DHZ: A Lightweight Spiking Neural Network Architecture for Underwater Image Dehazing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11482</link>

Abstract: Underwater image dehazing is critical for vision-based marine operations because light scattering and absorption can severely reduce visibility. This paper introduces snnTrans-DHZ, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) specifically designed for underwater dehazing. By leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs, snnTrans-DHZ efficiently processes time-dependent raw image sequences while maintaining low power consumption. Static underwater images are first converted into time-dependent sequences by repeatedly inputting the same image over user-defined timesteps. These RGB sequences are then transformed into LAB color space representations and processed concurrently. The architecture features three key modules: (i) a K estimator that extracts features from multiple color space representations; (ii) a Background Light Estimator that jointly infers the background light component from the RGB-LAB images; and (iii) a soft image reconstruction module that produces haze-free, visibility-enhanced outputs. The snnTrans-DHZ model is directly trained using a surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy alongside a novel combined loss function. Evaluated on the UIEB benchmark, snnTrans-DHZ achieves a PSNR of 21.68 dB and an SSIM of 0.8795, and on the EUVP dataset, it yields a PSNR of 23.46 dB and an SSIM of 0.8439. With only 0.5670 million network parameters, and requiring just 7.42 GSOPs and 0.0151 J of energy, the algorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency. These features make snnTrans-DHZ highly suitable for deployment in underwater robotics, marine exploration, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown to find interpretable features in neural networks from polysemantic neurons caused by superposition. Previous work has shown SAEs are an effective tool to extract interpretable features from the early layers of InceptionV1. Since then, there have been many improvements to SAEs but branch specialization is still an enigma in the later layers of InceptionV1. We show various examples of branch specialization occuring in each layer of the mixed4a-4e branch, in the 5x5 branch and in one 1x1 branch. We also provide evidence to claim that branch specialization seems to be consistent across layers, similar features across the model will be localized in the same convolution size branches in their respective layer.

<title>TransitReID: Transit OD Data Collection with Occlusion-Resistant Dynamic Passenger Re-Identification</title>

Abstract: Transit Origin-Destination (OD) data are essential for transit planning, particularly in route optimization and demand-responsive paratransit systems. Traditional methods, such as manual surveys, are costly and inefficient, while Bluetooth and WiFi-based approaches require passengers to carry specific devices, limiting data coverage. On the other hand, most transit vehicles are equipped with onboard cameras for surveillance, offering an opportunity to repurpose them for edge-based OD data collection through visual person re-identification (ReID). However, such approaches face significant challenges, including severe occlusion and viewpoint variations in transit environments, which greatly reduce matching accuracy and hinder their adoption. Moreover, designing effective algorithms that can operate efficiently on edge devices remains an open challenge. To address these challenges, we propose TransitReID, a novel framework for individual-level transit OD data collection. TransitReID consists of two key components: (1) An occlusion-robust ReID algorithm featuring a variational autoencoder guided region-attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on visible body regions through reconstruction loss-optimized weight allocation; and (2) a Hierarchical Storage and Dynamic Matching (HSDM) mechanism specifically designed for efficient and robust transit OD matching which balances storage, speed, and accuracy. Additionally, a multi-threaded design supports near real-time operation on edge devices, which also ensuring privacy protection. We also introduce a ReID dataset tailored for complex bus environments to address the lack of relevant training data. Experimental results demonstrate that TransitReID achieves state-of-the-art performance in ReID tasks, with an accuracy of approximately 90\% in bus route simulations.

Abstract: Predicting personality traits automatically has become a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper introduces an innovative multimodal feature learning framework for personality analysis in short video clips. For visual processing, we construct a facial graph and design a Geo-based two-stream network incorporating an attention mechanism, leveraging both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture static facial expressions. Additionally, ResNet18 and VGGFace networks are employed to extract global scene and facial appearance features at the frame level. To capture dynamic temporal information, we integrate a BiGRU with a temporal attention module for extracting salient frame representations. To enhance the model's robustness, we incorporate the VGGish CNN for audio-based features and XLM-Roberta for text-based features. Finally, a multimodal channel attention mechanism is introduced to integrate different modalities, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model is used to predict personality traits. Experimental results confirm that our proposed framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in performance.

arXiv:2504.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ConvShareViT, a novel deep learning architecture that adapts Vision Transformers (ViTs) to the 4f free-space optical system. ConvShareViT replaces linear layers in multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with a depthwise convolutional layer with shared weights across input channels. Through the development of ConvShareViT, the behaviour of convolutions within MHSA and their effectiveness in learning the attention mechanism were analysed systematically. Experimental results demonstrate that certain configurations, particularly those using valid-padded shared convolutions, can successfully learn attention, achieving comparable attention scores to those obtained with standard ViTs. However, other configurations, such as those using same-padded convolutions, show limitations in attention learning and operate like regular CNNs rather than transformer models. ConvShareViT architectures are specifically optimised for the 4f optical system, which takes advantage of the parallelism and high-resolution capabilities of optical systems. Results demonstrate that ConvShareViT can theoretically achieve up to 3.04 times faster inference than GPU-based systems. This potential acceleration makes ConvShareViT an attractive candidate for future optical deep learning applications and proves that our ViT (ConvShareViT) can be employed using only the convolution operation, via the necessary optimisation of the ViT to balance performance and complexity.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant breakthroughs in medical imaging, but these advancements are often dependent on large, well-annotated datasets. However, obtaining such datasets poses a significant challenge, as it requires time-consuming and labor-intensive annotations from medical experts. Consequently, there is growing interest in learning paradigms such as incomplete, inexact, and absent supervision, which are designed to operate under limited, inexact, or missing labels. This survey categorizes and reviews the evolving research in these areas, analyzing around 600 notable contributions since 2018. It covers tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and detection across various medical application areas, including but not limited to brain, chest, and cardiac imaging. We attempt to establish the relationships among existing research studies in related areas. We provide formal definitions of different learning paradigms and offer a comprehensive summary and interpretation of various learning mechanisms and strategies, aiding readers in better understanding the current research landscape and ideas. We also discuss potential future research challenges.

<title>DamageCAT: A Deep Learning Transformer Framework for Typology-Based Post-Disaster Building Damage Categorization</title>

arXiv:2504.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters increasingly threaten communities worldwide, creating an urgent need for rapid, reliable building damage assessment to guide emergency response and recovery efforts. Current methods typically classify damage in binary (damaged/undamaged) or ordinal severity terms, limiting their practical utility. In fact, the determination of damage typology is crucial for response and recovery efforts. To address this important gap, this paper introduces DamageCAT, a novel framework that provides typology-based categorical damage descriptions rather than simple severity ratings. Accordingly, this study presents two key contributions: (1) the BD-TypoSAT dataset containing satellite image triplets (pre-disaster, post-disaster, and damage masks) from Hurricane Ida with four damage categories (partial roof damage, total roof damage, partial structural collapse, and total structural collapse), and (2) a hierarchical U-Net-based transformer architecture that effectively processes pre-post disaster image pairs to identify and categorize building damage. Despite significant class imbalances in the training data, our model achieved robust performance with overall metrics of 0.7921 Intersection over Union (IoU) and 0.8835 F1 scores across all categories. The model's capability to recognize intricate damage typology in less common categories is especially remarkable. The DamageCAT framework advances automated damage assessment by providing actionable, typological information that better supports disaster response decision-making and resource allocation compared to traditional severity-based approaches.

Abstract: The World Health Organization suggests that road traffic crashes cost approximately 518 billion dollars globally each year, which accounts for 3% of the gross domestic product for most countries. Most fatal road accidents in urban areas involve Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Smart cities environments present innovative approaches to combat accidents involving cutting-edge technologies, that include advanced sensors, extensive datasets, Machine Learning (ML) models, communication systems, and edge computing. This paper proposes a strategy and an implementation of a system for road monitoring and safety for smart cities, based on Computer Vision (CV) and edge computing. Promising results were obtained by implementing vision algorithms and tracking using surveillance cameras, that are part of a Smart City testbed, the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab (ATCLL). The algorithm accurately detects and tracks cars, pedestrians, and bicycles, while predicting the road state, the distance between moving objects, and inferring on collision events to prevent collisions, in near real-time.

Abstract: Recent advances in Source-Free Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation (SFUVDA) leverage vision-language models to enhance pseudo-label generation. However, challenges such as noisy pseudo-labels and over-confident predictions limit their effectiveness in adapting well across domains. We propose Co-STAR, a novel framework that integrates curriculum learning with collaborative self-training between a source-trained teacher and a contrastive vision-language model (CLIP). Our curriculum learning approach employs a reliability-based weight function that measures bidirectional prediction alignment between the teacher and CLIP, balancing between confident and uncertain predictions. This function preserves uncertainty for difficult samples, while prioritizing reliable pseudo-labels when the predictions from both models closely align. To further improve adaptation, we propose Adaptive Curriculum Regularization, which modifies the learning priority of samples in a probabilistic, adaptive manner based on their confidence scores and prediction stability, mitigating overfitting to noisy and over-confident samples. Extensive experiments across multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that Co-STAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFUVDA methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI facilitates content creation and makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. While multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have encoded rich world knowledge, they are not inherently tailored for combating AI-generated Content (AIGC) and struggle to comprehend local forgery details. In this work, we investigate the application of multimodal LLMs in forgery detection. We propose a framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, localizing tampered regions, providing evidence, and tracing generation methods based on semantic tampering clues. Our method demonstrates that the potential of LLMs in forgery analysis can be effectively unlocked through meticulous prompt engineering and the application of few-shot learning techniques. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that GPT4V can achieve an accuracy of 92.1% in Autosplice and 86.3% in LaMa, which is competitive with state-of-the-art AIGC detection methods. We further discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs in such tasks and propose potential improvements.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that the key commonly-activating concepts extracted by SAEs are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts are strongly unimodal in activation, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many lie close to - but not entirely within - the subspace defining modality, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics despite their unimodal usage. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even unimodal concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges-offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.

Abstract: Existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods often overlook the intrinsic data distribution charac?teristics of point clouds, leading to suboptimal results when handling sparse and non-uniform point clouds. We propose a novel approach to point cloud upsampling by imposing constraints from the perspective of manifold distributions. Leveraging the strong fitting capability of Gaussian functions, our method employs a network to iteratively optimize Gaussian components and their weights, accurately representing local manifolds. By utilizing the probabilistic distribution properties of Gaussian functions, we construct a unified statistical manifold to impose distribution constraints on the point cloud. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality and more uniformly distributed dense point clouds when processing sparse and non-uniform inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art point cloud upsampling techniques.

Abstract: Few/zero-shot object counting methods reduce the need for extensive annotations but often struggle to distinguish between fine-grained categories, especially when multiple similar objects appear in the same scene. To address this limitation, we propose an annotation-free approach that enables the seamless integration of new fine-grained categories into existing few/zero-shot counting models. By leveraging latent generative models, we synthesize high-quality, category-specific crowded scenes, providing a rich training source for adapting to new categories without manual labeling. Our approach introduces an attention prediction network that identifies fine-grained category boundaries trained using only synthetic pseudo-annotated data. At inference, these fine-grained attention estimates refine the output of existing few/zero-shot counting networks. To benchmark our method, we further introduce the FGTC dataset, a taxonomy-specific fine-grained object counting dataset for natural images. Our method substantially enhances pre-trained state-of-the-art models on fine-grained taxon counting tasks, while using only synthetic data. Code and data to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In the past years, we have witnessed the remarkable success of Text-to-Image (T2I) models and their widespread use on the web. Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a million-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion models. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly alleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model performs well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios.

Abstract: Generating videos in the first-person perspective has broad application prospects in the field of augmented reality and embodied intelligence. In this work, we explore the cross-view video prediction task, where given an exo-centric video, the first frame of the corresponding ego-centric video, and textual instructions, the goal is to generate futur frames of the ego-centric video. Inspired by the notion that hand-object interactions (HOI) in ego-centric videos represent the primary intentions and actions of the current actor, we present EgoExo-Gen that explicitly models the hand-object dynamics for cross-view video prediction. EgoExo-Gen consists of two stages. First, we design a cross-view HOI mask prediction model that anticipates the HOI masks in future ego-frames by modeling the spatio-temporal ego-exo correspondence. Next, we employ a video diffusion model to predict future ego-frames using the first ego-frame and textual instructions, while incorporating the HOI masks as structural guidance to enhance prediction quality. To facilitate training, we develop an automated pipeline to generate pseudo HOI masks for both ego- and exo-videos by exploiting vision foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed EgoExo-Gen achieves better prediction performance compared to previous video prediction models on the Ego-Exo4D and H2O benchmark datasets, with the HOI masks significantly improving the generation of hands and interactive objects in the ego-centric videos.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-stream theory of the human visual system (HVS) - where the ventral stream is responsible for object recognition and detail analysis, while the dorsal stream focuses on spatial relationships and motion perception - an increasing number of video quality assessment (VQA) works built upon this framework are proposed. Recent advancements in large multi-modal models, notably Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have motivated researchers to incorporate CLIP into dual-stream-based VQA methods. This integration aims to harness the model's superior semantic understanding capabilities to replicate the object recognition and detail analysis in ventral stream, as well as spatial relationship analysis in dorsal stream. However, CLIP is originally designed for images and lacks the ability to capture temporal and motion information inherent in videos. %Furthermore, existing feature fusion strategies in no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) often rely on fixed weighting schemes, which fail to adaptively adjust feature importance. To address the limitation, this paper propose a Decoupled Vision-Language Modeling with Text-Guided Adaptation for Blind Video Quality Assessment (DVLTA-VQA), which decouples CLIP's visual and textual components, and integrates them into different stages of the NR-VQA pipeline.

Abstract: The evolution of Text-to-video (T2V) generative models, trained on large-scale datasets, has been marked by significant progress. However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RAPO}, a novel \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{O}ptimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.

arXiv:2504.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current skeleton action recognition models demonstrate impressive performance on large-scale datasets, their adaptation to new application scenarios remains challenging. These challenges are particularly pronounced when facing new action categories, diverse performers, and varied skeleton layouts, leading to significant performance degeneration. Additionally, the high cost and difficulty of collecting skeleton data make large-scale data collection impractical. This paper studies one-shot and limited-scale learning settings to enable efficient adaptation with minimal data. Existing approaches often overlook the rich mutual information between labeled samples, resulting in sub-optimal performance in low-data scenarios. To boost the utility of labeled data, we identify the variability among performers and the commonality within each action as two key attributes. We present SkeletonX, a lightweight training pipeline that integrates seamlessly with existing GCN-based skeleton action recognizers, promoting effective training under limited labeled data. First, we propose a tailored sample pair construction strategy on two key attributes to form and aggregate sample pairs. Next, we develop a concise and effective feature aggregation module to process these pairs. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD with various GCN backbones, demonstrating that the pipeline effectively improves performance when trained from scratch with limited data. Moreover, it surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the one-shot setting, with only 1/10 of the parameters and much fewer FLOPs.

Abstract: We study the hard problem of 3D object segmentation in complex point clouds without requiring human labels of 3D scenes for supervision. By relying on the similarity of pretrained 2D features or external signals such as motion to group 3D points as objects, existing unsupervised methods are usually limited to identifying simple objects like cars or their segmented objects are often inferior due to the lack of objectness in pretrained features. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage pipeline called GrabS. The core concept of our method is to learn generative and discriminative object-centric priors as a foundation from object datasets in the first stage, and then design an embodied agent to learn to discover multiple objects by querying against the pretrained generative priors in the second stage. We extensively evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and a newly created synthetic dataset, demonstrating remarkable segmentation performance, clearly surpassing all existing unsupervised methods.

Abstract: 3D garment simulation is a critical component for producing cloth-based graphics. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising approach for efficient garment simulation. However, GNNs require extensive message-passing to propagate information such as physical forces and maintain contact awareness across the entire garment mesh, which becomes computationally inefficient at higher resolutions. To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based mesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing range with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing (LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances message-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently propagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices. Concurrently, GSA introduces geodesic distance embeddings to represent the spatial relationship between vertices and utilises attention mechanisms to capture global mesh information. The two modules operate in parallel to ensure both short- and long-range mesh modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, requiring fewer layers and lower inference latency.

Abstract: Radar-Camera depth estimation aims to predict dense and accurate metric depth by fusing input images and Radar data. Model efficiency is crucial for this task in pursuit of real-time processing on autonomous vehicles and robotic platforms. However, due to the sparsity of Radar returns, the prevailing methods adopt multi-stage frameworks with intermediate quasi-dense depth, which are time-consuming and not robust. To address these challenges, we propose TacoDepth, an efficient and accurate Radar-Camera depth estimation model with one-stage fusion. Specifically, the graph-based Radar structure extractor and the pyramid-based Radar fusion module are designed to capture and integrate the graph structures of Radar point clouds, delivering superior model efficiency and robustness without relying on the intermediate depth results. Moreover, TacoDepth can be flexible for different inference modes, providing a better balance of speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art approach, TacoDepth improves depth accuracy and processing speed by 12.8% and 91.8%. Our work provides a new perspective on efficient Radar-Camera depth estimation.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MVQA) systems can interpret medical images in response to natural language queries. However, linguistic variability in question phrasing often undermines the consistency of these systems. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantically Equivalent Question Augmentation (SEQA) framework, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse yet semantically equivalent rephrasings of questions. Specifically, this approach enriches linguistic diversity while preserving semantic meaning. We further introduce an evaluation metric, Total Agreement Rate with Semantically Equivalent Input and Correct Answer (TAR-SC), which assesses a model's capability to generate consistent and correct responses to semantically equivalent linguistic variations. In addition, we also propose three other diversity metrics - average number of QA items per image (ANQI), average number of questions per image with the same answer (ANQA), and average number of open-ended questions per image with the same semantics (ANQS). Using the SEQA framework, we augmented the benchmarked MVQA public datasets of SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PathVQA. As a result, all three datasets achieved significant improvements by incorporating more semantically equivalent questions: ANQI increased by an average of 86.1, ANQA by 85.1, and ANQS by 46. Subsequent experiments evaluate three MVQA models (M2I2, MUMC, and BiomedGPT) under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings on the enhanced datasets. Experimental results in MVQA datasets show that fine-tuned models achieve an average accuracy improvement of 19.35%, while our proposed TAR-SC metric shows an average improvement of 11. 61%, indicating a substantial enhancement in model consistency.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal Video Object Detection (RGBT VOD) can address the limitation of traditional RGB-based VOD in challenging lighting conditions, making it more practical and effective in many applications.
  However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model.
  Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment.
  Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities.
  Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships.
  Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSI), aiming to detect unknown targets from backgrounds, is challenging for earth surface monitoring. However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs due to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training paradigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that, during training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are indispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for reducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State Space Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly detection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient alternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost Mamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of regions that are essential for HSI reconstruction. Additionally, we develop a consensus learning strategy from the optimization perspective to simultaneously facilitate background reconstruction and anomaly compression, further alleviating the negative impact of anomaly reconstruction. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify the superiority of ACMamba, demonstrating a faster speed and stronger performance over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The automatic generation of radiology reports has emerged as a promising solution to reduce a time-consuming task and accurately capture critical disease-relevant findings in X-ray images. Previous approaches for radiology report generation have shown impressive performance. However, there remains significant potential to improve accuracy by ensuring that retrieved reports contain disease-relevant findings similar to those in the X-ray images and by refining generated reports. In this study, we propose a Disease-aware image-text Alignment and self-correcting Re-alignment for Trustworthy radiology report generation (DART) framework. In the first stage, we generate initial reports based on image-to-text retrieval with disease-matching, embedding both images and texts in a shared embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures the retrieval of reports with similar disease-relevant findings that closely align with the input X-ray images. In the second stage, we further enhance the initial reports by introducing a self-correction module that re-aligns them with the X-ray images. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, surpassing previous approaches in both report generation and clinical efficacy metrics, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of radiology reports.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match the same pedestrian in a large gallery with different cameras and views. Enhancing the robustness of the extracted feature representations is a main challenge in Re-ID. Existing methods usually improve feature representation by improving model architecture, but most methods ignore the potential contextual information, which limits the effectiveness of feature representation and retrieval performance. Neighborhood information, especially the potential information of multi-order neighborhoods, can effectively enrich feature expression and improve retrieval accuracy, but this has not been fully explored in existing research. Therefore, we propose a novel model DMON-ARO that leverages latent neighborhood information to enhance both feature representation and index performance. Our approach is built on two complementary modules: Dynamic Multi-Order Neighbor Modeling (DMON) and Asymmetric Relationship Optimization (ARO). The DMON module dynamically aggregates multi-order neighbor relationships, allowing it to capture richer contextual information and enhance feature representation through adaptive neighborhood modeling. Meanwhile, ARO refines the distance matrix by optimizing query-to-gallery relationships, improving the index accuracy. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves performance improvements against baseline models, which illustrate the effectiveness of our model. Specifically, our model demonstrates improvements in Rank-1 accuracy and mAP. Moreover, this method can also be directly extended to other re-identification tasks.

Abstract: The low-quality structure in raw depth maps is prevalent in real-world RGB-D datasets, which makes real-world depth recovery a critical task in recent years. However, the lack of paired raw-ground truth (raw-GT) data in the real world poses challenges for generalized depth recovery. Existing methods insufficiently consider the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth maps, which leads to poor generalization in real-world depth recovery. Notably, random structure misalignments are not limited to raw depth data but also affect GT depth in real-world datasets. In the proposed method, we tackle the generalization problem from both input and output perspectives. For input, we enrich the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth maps by designing a new raw depth generation pipeline, which helps the network avoid overfitting to a specific condition. Furthermore, a structure uncertainty module is designed to explicitly identify the misaligned structure for input raw depth maps to better generalize in unseen scenarios. Notably the well-trained depth foundation model (DFM) can help the structure uncertainty module estimate the structure uncertainty better. For output, a robust feature alignment module is designed to precisely align with the accurate structure of RGB images avoiding the interference of inaccurate GT depth. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy and generalization capabilities across various challenging raw depth maps.

Abstract: Despite the rapid evolution of learning and computer vision algorithms, Fine-Grained Classification (FGC) still poses an open problem in many practically relevant applications. In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, how to effectively train the network without using real-world labels remains a challenging problem. In this paper, driven by the recent advancements of vision foundation models, a novel method termed DFM-MVS, is proposed to leverage the depth foundation model to generate the effective depth prior, so as to boost MVS in the absence of real-world labels. Specifically, a depth prior-based pseudo-supervised training mechanism is developed to simulate realistic stereo correspondences using the generated depth prior, thereby constructing effective supervision for the MVS network. Besides, a depth prior-guided error correction strategy is presented to leverage the depth prior as guidance to mitigate the error propagation problem inherent in the widely-used coarse-to-fine network structure. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFM-MVS significantly outperforms existing MVS methods without using real-world labels.

<title>ACE: Attentional Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Large text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image synthesis capabilities, but their indiscriminate training on Internet-scale data has led to learned concepts that enable harmful, copyrighted, or otherwise undesirable content generation. We address the task of concept erasure in diffusion models, i.e., removing a specified concept from a pre-trained model such that prompting the concept (or related synonyms) no longer yields its depiction, while preserving the model's ability to generate other content. We propose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a closed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning. Theoretically, we formulate concept erasure as aligning the model's conditional distribution on the target concept with a neutral distribution. Our approach identifies and nullifies concept-specific latent directions in the cross-attention modules via a gated low-rank adaptation, followed by adversarially augmented fine-tuning to ensure thorough erasure of the concept and its synonyms. Empirically, we demonstrate on multiple benchmarks, including object classes, celebrity faces, explicit content, and artistic styles, that ACE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal efficacy and robustness. Compared to prior methods, ACE better balances generality (erasing concept and related terms) and specificity (preserving unrelated content), scales to dozens of concepts, and is efficient, requiring only a few seconds of adaptation per concept. We will release our code to facilitate safer deployment of diffusion models.

<title>Cross-Frequency Collaborative Training Network and Dataset for Semi-supervised First Molar Root Canal Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Root canal (RC) treatment is a highly delicate and technically complex procedure in clinical practice, heavily influenced by the clinicians' experience and subjective judgment. Deep learning has made significant advancements in the field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) because it can provide more objective and accurate diagnostic results. However, its application in RC treatment is still relatively rare, mainly due to the lack of public datasets in this field. To address this issue, in this paper, we established a First Molar Root Canal segmentation dataset called FMRC-2025. Additionally, to alleviate the workload of manual annotation for dentists and fully leverage the unlabeled data, we designed a Cross-Frequency Collaborative training semi-supervised learning (SSL) Network called CFC-Net. It consists of two components: (1) Cross-Frequency Collaborative Mean Teacher (CFC-MT), which introduces two specialized students (SS) and one comprehensive teacher (CT) for collaborative multi-frequency training. The CT and SS are trained on different frequency components while fully integrating multi-frequency knowledge through cross and full frequency consistency supervisions. (2) Uncertainty-guided Cross-Frequency Mix (UCF-Mix) mechanism enables the network to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels while learning to integrate multi-frequency information and maintaining the structural integrity of the targets. Extensive experiments on FMRC-2025 and three public dental datasets demonstrate that CFC-MT is effective for RC segmentation and can also exhibit strong generalizability on other dental segmentation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art SSL medical image segmentation methods. Codes and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Blood vessel networks in the brain play a crucial role in stroke research, where understanding their topology is essential for analyzing blood flow dynamics. However, extracting detailed topological vessel network information from microscopy data remains a significant challenge, mainly due to the scarcity of labeled training data and the need for high topological accuracy. This work combines synthetic data generation with deep learning to automatically extract vessel networks as graphs from volumetric microscopy data. To combat data scarcity, we introduce a comprehensive pipeline for generating large-scale synthetic datasets that mirror the characteristics of real vessel networks. Our three-stage approach progresses from abstract graph generation through vessel mask creation to realistic medical image synthesis, incorporating biological constraints and imaging artifacts at each stage. Using this synthetic data, we develop a two-stage deep learning pipeline of 3D U-Net-based models for node detection and edge prediction. Fine-tuning on real microscopy data shows promising adaptation, improving edge prediction F1 scores from 0.496 to 0.626 by training on merely 5 manually labeled samples. These results suggest that automated vessel network extraction is becoming practically feasible, opening new possibilities for large-scale vascular analysis in stroke research.

Abstract: Pelvic fractures, often caused by high-impact trauma, frequently require surgical intervention. Imaging techniques such as CT and 2D X-ray imaging are used to transfer the surgical plan to the operating room through image registration, enabling quick intraoperative adjustments. Specifically, segmenting pelvic fractures from 2D X-ray imaging can assist in accurately positioning bone fragments and guiding the placement of screws or metal plates. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based category and fragment segmentation (CFS) framework for the automatic segmentation of pelvic bone fragments in 2D X-ray images. The framework consists of three consecutive steps: category segmentation, fragment segmentation, and post-processing. Our best model achieves an IoU of 0.91 for anatomical structures and 0.78 for fracture segmentation. Results demonstrate that the CFS framework is effective and accurate.

<title>Learning Compatible Multi-Prize Subnetworks for Asymmetric Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Asymmetric retrieval is a typical scenario in real-world retrieval systems, where compatible models of varying capacities are deployed on platforms with different resource configurations. Existing methods generally train pre-defined networks or subnetworks with capacities specifically designed for pre-determined platforms, using compatible learning. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from limited flexibility for multi-platform deployment. For example, when introducing a new platform into the retrieval systems, developers have to train an additional model at an appropriate capacity that is compatible with existing models via backward-compatible learning. In this paper, we propose a Prunable Network with self-compatibility, which allows developers to generate compatible subnetworks at any desired capacity through post-training pruning. Thus it allows the creation of a sparse subnetwork matching the resources of the new platform without additional training. Specifically, we optimize both the architecture and weight of subnetworks at different capacities within a dense network in compatible learning. We also design a conflict-aware gradient integration scheme to handle the gradient conflicts between the dense network and subnetworks during compatible learning. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks and visual backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Bunny-Black/PrunNet.

<title>CAGS: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11893</link>

arXiv:2504.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is crucial for applications requiring natural language-driven spatial interpretation, such as robotics and augmented reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation for scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks reveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue, stemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object segmentations across views (e.g., a "coffee set" segmented as a single entity in one view but as "cup + coffee + spoon" in another). Existing 3DGS-based methods often rely on isolated per-Gaussian feature learning, neglecting the spatial context needed for cohesive object reasoning, leading to fragmented representations. We propose Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting (CAGS), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating spatial context into 3DGS. CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across Gaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric contrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages a precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing neighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes. By integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance segmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and ScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.

<title>Search is All You Need for Few-shot Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) has emerged as a crucial yet challenging task in industrial inspection, where normal distribution modeling must be accomplished with only a few normal images. While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image decomposition offers deep insights into the imaging factors of visual data and significantly enhances various advanced computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to low-light image enhancement based on decomposed physics-informed priors. Existing methods that directly map low-light to normal-light images in the sRGB color space suffer from inconsistent color predictions and high sensitivity to spectral power distribution (SPD) variations, resulting in unstable performance under diverse lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Physics-informed Color-aware Transform (PiCat), a learning-based framework that converts low-light images from the sRGB color space into deep illumination-invariant descriptors via our proposed Color-aware Transform (CAT). This transformation enables robust handling of complex lighting and SPD variations. Complementing this, we propose the Content-Noise Decomposition Network (CNDN), which refines the descriptor distributions to better align with well-lit conditions by mitigating noise and other distortions, thereby effectively restoring content representations to low-light images. The CAT and the CNDN collectively act as a physical prior, guiding the transformation process from low-light to normal-light domains. Our proposed PiCat framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) poses a formidable challenge due to the scarcity of defective samples, making it imperative to deploy models capable of robust generalization to detect unseen anomalies effectively. Traditional approaches, often constrained by hand-crafted features or domain-specific expert models, struggle to address this limitation, underscoring the need for a paradigm shift. We introduce AnomalyR1, a pioneering framework that leverages VLM-R1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) renowned for its exceptional generalization and interpretability, to revolutionize IAD. By integrating MLLM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhanced by our novel Reasoned Outcome Alignment Metric (ROAM), AnomalyR1 achieves a fully end-to-end solution that autonomously processes inputs of image and domain knowledge, reasons through analysis, and generates precise anomaly localizations and masks. Based on the latest multimodal IAD benchmark, our compact 3-billion-parameter model outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results. As MLLM capabilities continue to advance, this study is the first to deliver an end-to-end VLM-based IAD solution that demonstrates the transformative potential of ROAM-enhanced GRPO, positioning our framework as a forward-looking cornerstone for next-generation intelligent anomaly detection systems in industrial applications with limited defective data.

<title>Zooming In on Fakes: A Novel Dataset for Localized AI-Generated Image Detection with Forgery Amplification Approach</title>

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated image editing tools has made localized forgeries increasingly realistic, posing challenges for visual content integrity. Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose \textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/clpbc/BR-Gen.

<title>Beyond Words: Augmenting Discriminative Richness via Diffusions in Unsupervised Prompt Learning</title>

arXiv:2504.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) with large amounts of unlabeled data has recently garnered significant interest. However, a key challenge remains the lack of high-quality pseudo-labeled data. Current pseudo-labeling strategies often struggle with mismatches between semantic and visual information, leading to sub-optimal performance of unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) methods. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective approach called \textbf{A}ugmenting D\textbf{i}scriminative \textbf{R}ichness via Diffusions (AiR), toward learning a richer discriminating way to represent the class comprehensively and thus facilitate classification. Specifically, our approach includes a pseudo-label generation module that leverages high-fidelity synthetic samples to create an auxiliary classifier, which captures richer visual variation, bridging text-image-pair classification to a more robust image-image-pair classification. Additionally, we exploit the diversity of diffusion-based synthetic samples to enhance prompt learning, providing greater information for semantic-visual alignment. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks, including RESISC45 and Flowers102, and across three learning paradigms-UL, SSL, and TRZSL-demonstrate that AiR achieves substantial and consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised prompt learning methods.

arXiv:2504.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh reconstruction from multi-view images is a fundamental problem in computer vision, but its performance degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions, especially in unseen regions where no ground-truth observations are available. While recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing novel views from limited inputs, their outputs often suffer from visual artifacts and lack 3D consistency, posing challenges for reliable mesh optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enhance sparse-view mesh reconstruction in a principled and reliable manner. To address the instability of diffusion outputs, we propose a Consensus Diffusion Module that filters unreliable generations via interquartile range (IQR) analysis and performs variance-aware image fusion to produce robust pseudo-supervision. Building on this, we design an online reinforcement learning strategy based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to adaptively select the most informative viewpoints for enhancement, guided by diffusion loss. Finally, the fused images are used to jointly supervise a NeRF-based model alongside sparse-view ground truth, ensuring consistency across both geometry and appearance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both geometric quality and rendering quality.

Abstract: Feature matching across video streams remains a cornerstone challenge in computer vision. Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.

Abstract: As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy labels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years. Learning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior recognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples, impacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is barely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we propose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity recognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the model to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given videos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently perform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs. Furthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two selection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean samples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive parameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across classes. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&amp;Act dataset for all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method in comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image classification field. The source code is available at https://github.com/ilonafan/DAR-noisy-labels.

This survey provides a wide-ranging examination of the anti-UAV domain, centering on three core objectives-classification, detection, and tracking-while detailing emerging methodologies such as diffusion-based data synthesis, multi-modal fusion, vision-language modeling, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art solutions across both single-modality and multi-sensor pipelines (spanning RGB, infrared, audio, radar, and RF) and discuss large-scale as well as adversarially oriented benchmarks. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in real-time performance, stealth detection, and swarm-based scenarios, underscoring pressing needs for robust, adaptive anti-UAV systems. By highlighting open research directions, we aim to foster innovation and guide the development of next-generation defense strategies in an era marked by the extensive use of UAVs.

Abstract: The YOLO (You Only Look Once) series has been a leading framework in real-time object detection, consistently improving the balance between speed and accuracy. However, integrating attention mechanisms into YOLO has been challenging due to their high computational overhead. YOLOv12 introduces a novel approach that successfully incorporates attention-based enhancements while preserving real-time performance. This paper provides a comprehensive review of YOLOv12's architectural innovations, including Area Attention for computationally efficient self-attention, Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks for improved feature aggregation, and FlashAttention for optimized memory access. Additionally, we benchmark YOLOv12 against prior YOLO versions and competing object detectors, analyzing its improvements in accuracy, inference speed, and computational efficiency. Through this analysis, we demonstrate how YOLOv12 advances real-time object detection by refining the latency-accuracy trade-off and optimizing computational resources.

Abstract: Vision foundation models in remote sensing have been extensively studied due to their superior generalization on various downstream tasks. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, providing significant advantages for Earth observation. However, establishing a foundation model for SAR image interpretation inevitably encounters the challenges of insufficient information utilization and poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing foundation model based on complex-valued SAR data, which simulates the polarimetric decomposition process for pre-training, i.e., characterizing pixel scattering intensity as a weighted combination of scattering bases and scattering coefficients, thereby endowing the foundation model with physical interpretability. Specifically, we construct a series of scattering queries, each representing an independent and meaningful scattering basis, which interact with SAR features in the scattering query decoder and output the corresponding scattering coefficient. To guide the pre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power self-supervision loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted coefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power from the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image's power. The performance of our foundation model is validated on six typical downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the foundation model can extract stable feature representations and exhibits strong generalization, even in data-scarce conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) generation models, assessing the semantic alignment between generated images and text descriptions has become a significant research challenge. Current methods, including those based on Visual Question Answering (VQA), still struggle with fine-grained assessments and precise quantification of image-text alignment. This paper presents an improved evaluation method named Instruction-augmented Multimodal Alignment for Image-Text and Element Matching (iMatch), which evaluates image-text semantic alignment by fine-tuning multimodal large language models. We introduce four innovative augmentation strategies: First, the QAlign strategy creates a precise probabilistic mapping to convert discrete scores from multimodal large language models into continuous matching scores. Second, a validation set augmentation strategy uses pseudo-labels from model predictions to expand training data, boosting the model's generalization performance. Third, an element augmentation strategy integrates element category labels to refine the model's understanding of image-text matching. Fourth, an image augmentation strategy employs techniques like random lighting to increase the model's robustness. Additionally, we propose prompt type augmentation and score perturbation strategies to further enhance the accuracy of element assessments. Our experimental results show that the iMatch method significantly surpasses existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and practical value. Furthermore, our iMatch won first place in the CVPR NTIRE 2025 Text to Image Generation Model Quality Assessment - Track 1 Image-Text Alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in sign language research have benefited from CNN-based backbones, which are primarily transferred from traditional computer vision tasks (\eg object identification, image recognition). However, these CNN-based backbones usually excel at extracting features like contours and texture, but may struggle with capturing sign-related features. In fact, sign language tasks require focusing on sign-related regions, including the collaboration between different regions (\eg left hand region and right hand region) and the effective content in a single region. To capture such region-related features, we introduce MixSignGraph, which represents sign sequences as a group of mixed graphs and designs the following three graph modules for feature extraction, \ie Local Sign Graph (LSG) module, Temporal Sign Graph (TSG) module and Hierarchical Sign Graph (HSG) module. Specifically, the LSG module learns the correlation of intra-frame cross-region features within one frame, \ie focusing on spatial features. The TSG module tracks the interaction of inter-frame cross-region features among adjacent frames, \ie focusing on temporal features. The HSG module aggregates the same-region features from different-granularity feature maps of a frame, \ie focusing on hierarchical features. In addition, to further improve the performance of sign language tasks without gloss annotations, we propose a simple yet counter-intuitive Text-driven CTC Pre-training (TCP) method, which generates pseudo gloss labels from text labels for model pre-training. Extensive experiments conducted on current five public sign language datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model. Notably, our model surpasses the SOTA models on multiple sign language tasks across several datasets, without relying on any additional cues.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way we analyze sports videos, whether to understand the actions of games in long untrimmed videos or to anticipate the player's motion in future frames. Despite these efforts, little attention has been given to anticipating game actions before they occur. In this work, we introduce the task of action anticipation for football broadcast videos, which consists in predicting future actions in unobserved future frames, within a five- or ten-second anticipation window. To benchmark this task, we release a new dataset, namely the SoccerNet Ball Action Anticipation dataset, based on SoccerNet Ball Action Spotting. Additionally, we propose a Football Action ANticipation TRAnsformer (FAANTRA), a baseline method that adapts FUTR, a state-of-the-art action anticipation model, to predict ball-related actions. To evaluate action anticipation, we introduce new metrics, including mAP@$\delta$, which evaluates the temporal precision of predicted future actions, as well as mAP@$\infty$, which evaluates their occurrence within the anticipation window. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to examine the impact of various task settings, input configurations, and model architectures. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and challenges of action anticipation in football videos, providing valuable insights into the design of predictive models for sports analytics. By forecasting actions before they unfold, our work will enable applications in automated broadcasting, tactical analysis, and player decision-making. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/MohamadDalal/FAANTRA.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models, such as OpenAI's Sora, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality videos from a text prompt. In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a critical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are learned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video synthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention blocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results indicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing and layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and the aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy attention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas low-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame structure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video quality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on lightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy and effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental evaluation across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Object placement aims to determine the appropriate placement (\emph{e.g.}, location and size) of a foreground object when placing it on the background image. Most previous works are limited by small-scale labeled dataset, which hinders the real-world application of object placement. In this work, we devise a semi-supervised framework which can exploit large-scale unlabeled dataset to promote the generalization ability of discriminative object placement models. The discriminative models predict the rationality label for each foreground placement given a foreground-background pair. To better leverage the labeled data, under the semi-supervised framework, we further propose to transfer the knowledge of rationality variation, \emph{i.e.}, whether the change of foreground placement would result in the change of rationality label, from labeled data to unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can effectively enhance the generalization ability of discriminative object placement models.

Abstract: Radar-based HAR has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional monitoring approaches, such as wearable devices and camera-based systems, due to its unique privacy preservation and robustness advantages. However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as ViT and SSM architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision models have seen increased usage in sports, and reinforcement learning (RL) is famous for beating humans in strategic games such as Chess and Go. In this paper, we are interested in building upon these advances and examining the game of classic 8-ball pool. We introduce pix2pockets, a foundation for an RL-assisted pool coach. Given a single image of a pool table, we first aim to detect the table and the balls and then propose the optimal shot suggestion. For the first task, we build a dataset with 195 diverse images where we manually annotate all balls and table dots, leading to 5748 object segmentation masks. For the second task, we build a standardized RL environment that allows easy development and benchmarking of any RL algorithm. Our object detection model yields an AP50 of 91.2 while our ball location pipeline obtains an error of only 0.4 cm. Furthermore, we compare standard RL algorithms to set a baseline for the shot suggestion task and we show that all of them fail to pocket all balls without making a foul move. We also present a simple baseline that achieves a per-shot success rate of 94.7% and clears a full game in a single turn 30% of the time.

Abstract: Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate high-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success due to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly rely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and perform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of video. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes and multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the overall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change scenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a given complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user instructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition actions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given camera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the diffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose CamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera movements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to ensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the generated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our proposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos together with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements. Generated results are available at https://modular-cam.github.io.

<title>Single-shot Star-convex Polygon-based Instance Segmentation for Spatially-correlated Biomedical Objects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12078</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical images often contain objects known to be spatially correlated or nested due to their inherent properties, leading to semantic relations. Examples include cell nuclei being nested within eukaryotic cells and colonies growing exclusively within their culture dishes. While these semantic relations bear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently, requiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could constitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful representations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus far, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue that the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be achieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD) and the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take advantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are constructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints into account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on object interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior in a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary Regularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance segmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on $IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate (JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose. Our approach can be further modified to capture partial-inclusion/-exclusion in multi-object interactions in fluorescent or brightfield microscopy or digital imaging. Finally, our strategy suggests gains by making this learning single-shot and computationally efficient.

<title>DC-SAM: In-Context Segment Anything in Images and Videos via Dual Consistency</title>

Abstract: Given a single labeled example, in-context segmentation aims to segment corresponding objects. This setting, known as one-shot segmentation in few-shot learning, explores the segmentation model's generalization ability and has been applied to various vision tasks, including scene understanding and image/video editing. While recent Segment Anything Models have achieved state-of-the-art results in interactive segmentation, these approaches are not directly applicable to in-context segmentation. In this work, we propose the Dual Consistency SAM (DC-SAM) method based on prompt-tuning to adapt SAM and SAM2 for in-context segmentation of both images and videos. Our key insights are to enhance the features of the SAM's prompt encoder in segmentation by providing high-quality visual prompts. When generating a mask prior, we fuse the SAM features to better align the prompt encoder. Then, we design a cycle-consistent cross-attention on fused features and initial visual prompts. Next, a dual-branch design is provided by using the discriminative positive and negative prompts in the prompt encoder. Furthermore, we design a simple mask-tube training strategy to adopt our proposed dual consistency method into the mask tube. Although the proposed DC-SAM is primarily designed for images, it can be seamlessly extended to the video domain with the support of SAM2. Given the absence of in-context segmentation in the video domain, we manually curate and construct the first benchmark from existing video segmentation datasets, named In-Context Video Object Segmentation (IC-VOS), to better assess the in-context capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 55.5 (+1.4) mIoU on COCO-20i, 73.0 (+1.1) mIoU on PASCAL-5i, and a J&amp;F score of 71.52 on the proposed IC-VOS benchmark.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), they still struggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, hallucinate, and often make simple mistakes on even simple video question-answering tasks, all of which pose significant challenges to their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment framework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed framework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response pairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common error patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal understanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and over-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among others. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred and non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference Optimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes sub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that RRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO. Our experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video understanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech. However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. We propose AttentionDrop, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques that operate directly on the self-attention distributions. We introduces three variants: 1. Hard Attention Masking: randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization. 2. Blurred Attention Smoothing: applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions. 3. Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop: enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss.

<title>Generalized Visual Relation Detection with Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12100</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to identify relationships (or interactions) between object pairs in an image. Although recent VRD models have achieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined relation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity characteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual relations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words from different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and ``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this end, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design diffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner, termed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate all possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the generation, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as conditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation, we design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to subject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting from the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate visual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To properly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation metrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image captioning. Extensive experiments in both human-object interaction (HOI) detection and scene graph generation (SGG) benchmarks attest to the superiority and effectiveness of Diff-VRD.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable metric depth estimation is crucial for various computer vision applications but remains challenging due to the diverse depth scales encountered in indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we introduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation method that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages an anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to separate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field depth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor, enabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while mapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth from zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified representation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene scale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide along the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A smaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth precision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in far regions. This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at varying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets. Our design enables a unified and adaptive depth representation across diverse environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Metric-Solver outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: With its powerful visual-language alignment capability, CLIP performs well in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. However, we found in experiments that CLIP's logits suffer from serious inter-class confusion problems in downstream tasks, and the ambiguity between categories seriously affects the accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Logits DeConfusion, which effectively learns and eliminates inter-class confusion in logits by combining our Multi-level Adapter Fusion (MAF) module with our Inter-Class Deconfusion (ICD) module. Our MAF extracts features from different levels and fuses them uniformly to enhance feature representation. Our ICD learnably eliminates inter-class confusion in logits with a residual structure. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the classification performance and alleviate the inter-class confusion problem.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is essential for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and disaster response. However, data loss due to cloud cover, sensor failures, or incomplete acquisition-especially in high-resolution and high-frequency tasks-severely limits satellite imagery's effectiveness. Traditional interpolation methods struggle with large missing areas and complex structures. Remote sensing imagery consists of multiple bands, each with distinct meanings, and ensuring consistency across bands is critical to avoid anomalies in the combined images. This paper proposes SatelliteMaker, a diffusion-based method that reconstructs missing data across varying levels of data loss while maintaining spatial, spectral, and temporal consistency. We also propose Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as a conditioning input and use tailored prompts to generate realistic images, making diffusion models applicable to quantitative remote sensing tasks. Additionally, we propose a VGG-Adapter module based on Distribution Loss, which reduces distribution discrepancy and ensures style consistency. Extensive experiments show that SatelliteMaker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Detection of spatial areas where biodiversity is at risk is of paramount importance for the conservation and monitoring of ecosystems. Large terrestrial mammalian herbivores are keystone species as their activity not only has deep effects on soils, plants, and animals, but also shapes landscapes, as large herbivores act as allogenic ecosystem engineers. One key landscape feature that indicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is the formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous trampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of tracks of bare soil. Here, we evaluated different algorithms based on machine learning techniques to identify grazing trails. Our goal is to automatically detect potential areas with intense herbivory activity, which might be beneficial for conservation and management plans.
  We have applied five semantic segmentation methods combined with fourteen encoders aimed at mapping grazing trails on aerial images. Our results indicate that in most cases the chosen methodology successfully mapped the trails, although there were a few instances where the actual trail structure was underestimated. The UNet architecture with the MambaOut encoder was the best architecture for mapping trails. The proposed approach could be applied to develop tools for mapping and monitoring temporal changes in these landscape structures to support habitat conservation and land management programs. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that competitive image segmentation results are obtained for the detection and delineation of trails of large herbivorous mammals.

Abstract: The rise of customized diffusion models has spurred a boom in personalized visual content creation, but also poses risks of malicious misuse, severely threatening personal privacy and copyright protection. Some studies show that the aesthetic properties of images are highly positively correlated with human perception of image quality. Inspired by this, we approach the problem from a novel and intriguing aesthetic perspective to degrade the generation quality of maliciously customized models, thereby achieving better protection of facial identity. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anti-Aesthetic (HAA) framework to fully explore aesthetic cues, which consists of two key branches: 1) Global Anti-Aesthetics: By establishing a global anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a global anti-aesthetic loss, it can degrade the overall aesthetics of the generated content; 2) Local Anti-Aesthetics: A local anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a local anti-aesthetic loss are designed to guide adversarial perturbations to disrupt local facial identity. By seamlessly integrating both branches, our HAA effectively achieves the goal of anti-aesthetics from a global to a local level during customized generation. Extensive experiments show that HAA outperforms existing SOTA methods largely in identity removal, providing a powerful tool for protecting facial privacy and copyright.

<title>Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision</title>

Abstract: Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), these models still suffer from generating hallucinatory responses that do not align with the visual input provided. To mitigate such hallucinations, we introduce Efficient Contrastive Decoding (ECD), a simple method that leverages probabilistic hallucination detection to shift the output distribution towards contextually accurate answers at inference time. By contrasting token probabilities and hallucination scores, ECD subtracts hallucinated concepts from the original distribution, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method can be applied to any open-source LVLM and does not require additional LVLM training. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and across different LVLMs. Our experiments show that ECD effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with respect to performance on LVLM benchmarks and computation time.

Abstract: Movie Audio Description (AD) aims to narrate visual content during dialogue-free segments, particularly benefiting blind and visually impaired (BVI) audiences. Compared with general video captioning, AD demands plot-relevant narration with explicit character name references, posing unique challenges in movie understanding.To identify active main characters and focus on storyline-relevant regions, we propose FocusedAD, a novel framework that delivers character-centric movie audio descriptions. It includes: (i) a Character Perception Module(CPM) for tracking character regions and linking them to names; (ii) a Dynamic Prior Module(DPM) that injects contextual cues from prior ADs and subtitles via learnable soft prompts; and (iii) a Focused Caption Module(FCM) that generates narrations enriched with plot-relevant details and named characters. To overcome limitations in character identification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character query banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-eval-Named and our newly proposed Cinepile-AD dataset. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/FocusedAD .

Abstract: Homography estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in diverse fields. Recent advances in deep learning have improved homography estimation, particularly with unsupervised learning approaches, offering increased robustness and generalizability. However, accurately predicting homography, especially in complex motions, remains a challenge. In response, this work introduces a novel method leveraging video coding, particularly by harnessing inherent motion vectors (MVs) present in videos. We present CodingHomo, an unsupervised framework for homography estimation. Our framework features a Mask-Guided Fusion (MGF) module that identifies and utilizes beneficial features among the MVs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of homography prediction. Additionally, the Mask-Guided Homography Estimation (MGHE) module is presented for eliminating undesired features in the coarse-to-fine homography refinement process. CodingHomo outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, delivering good robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Semantic 3D city models are worldwide easy-accessible, providing accurate, object-oriented, and semantic-rich 3D priors. To date, their potential to mitigate the noise impact on radar object detection remains under-explored. In this paper, we first introduce a unique dataset, RadarCity, comprising 54K synchronized radar-image pairs and semantic 3D city models. Moreover, we propose a novel neural network, RADLER, leveraging the effectiveness of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) and semantic 3D city models to enhance radar object detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. Specifically, we first obtain the robust radar features via a SSL network in the radar-image pretext task. We then use a simple yet effective feature fusion strategy to incorporate semantic-depth features from semantic 3D city models. Having prior 3D information as guidance, RADLER obtains more fine-grained details to enhance radar object detection. We extensively evaluate RADLER on the collected RadarCity dataset and demonstrate average improvements of 5.46% in mean avarage precision (mAP) and 3.51% in mean avarage recall (mAR) over previous radar object detection methods. We believe this work will foster further research on semantic-guided and map-supported radar object detection. Our project page is publicly available athttps://gpp-communication.github.io/RADLER .

<title>Towards a General-Purpose Zero-Shot Synthetic Low-Light Image and Video Pipeline</title>

Abstract: Low-light conditions pose significant challenges for both human and machine annotation. This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.

Abstract: We introduce an approach for detecting and tracking detailed 3D poses of multiple people from a single monocular camera stream. Our system maintains temporally coherent predictions in crowded scenes filled with difficult poses and occlusions. Our model performs both strong per-frame detection and a learned pose update to track people from frame to frame. Rather than match detections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image, which enables online tracking through occlusion. We train on numerous image and video datasets leveraging pseudo-labeled annotations to produce a model that matches state-of-the-art systems in 3D pose estimation accuracy while being faster and more accurate in tracking multiple people through time.

<title>Beyond Patches: Mining Interpretable Part-Prototypes for Explainable AI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has provided considerable advancements for multimedia systems, yet the interpretability of deep models remains a challenge. State-of-the-art post-hoc explainability methods, such as GradCAM, provide visual interpretation based on heatmaps but lack conceptual clarity. Prototype-based approaches, like ProtoPNet and PIPNet, offer a more structured explanation but rely on fixed patches, limiting their robustness and semantic consistency.
  To address these limitations, a part-prototypical concept mining network (PCMNet) is proposed that dynamically learns interpretable prototypes from meaningful regions. PCMNet clusters prototypes into concept groups, creating semantically grounded explanations without requiring additional annotations. Through a joint process of unsupervised part discovery and concept activation vector extraction, PCMNet effectively captures discriminative concepts and makes interpretable classification decisions.
  Our extensive experiments comparing PCMNet against state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets show that it can provide a high level of interpretability, stability, and robustness under clean and occluded scenarios.

<title>Towards Realistic Low-Light Image Enhancement via ISP Driven Data Modeling</title>

arXiv:2504.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently become the leading method for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). However, despite significant progress, their outputs may still exhibit issues such as amplified noise, incorrect white balance, or unnatural enhancements when deployed in real world applications. A key challenge is the lack of diverse, large scale training data that captures the complexities of low-light conditions and imaging pipelines. In this paper, we propose a novel image signal processing (ISP) driven data synthesis pipeline that addresses these challenges by generating unlimited paired training data. Specifically, our pipeline begins with easily collected high-quality normal-light images, which are first unprocessed into the RAW format using a reverse ISP. We then synthesize low-light degradations directly in the RAW domain. The resulting data is subsequently processed through a series of ISP stages, including white balance adjustment, color space conversion, tone mapping, and gamma correction, with controlled variations introduced at each stage. This broadens the degradation space and enhances the diversity of the training data, enabling the generated data to capture a wide range of degradations and the complexities inherent in the ISP pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic pipeline, we conduct extensive experiments using a vanilla UNet model consisting solely of convolutional layers, group normalization, GeLU activation, and convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs). Extensive testing across multiple datasets reveals that the vanilla UNet model trained with our data synthesis pipeline delivers high fidelity, visually appealing enhancement results, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Reliable tumor segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) remains challenging due to boundary ambiguity, class imbalance, and anatomical variability. We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware post-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed by anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung surfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a second-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve accuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private and public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with fewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results highlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in cascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor delineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice from 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated with segmentation gains, underscoring the value of anatomically informed post-processing.

<title>Coding-Prior Guided Diffusion Network for Video Deblurring</title>

Abstract: While recent video deblurring methods have advanced significantly, they often overlook two valuable prior information: (1) motion vectors (MVs) and coding residuals (CRs) from video codecs, which provide efficient inter-frame alignment cues, and (2) the rich real-world knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion generative models. We present CPGDNet, a novel two-stage framework that effectively leverages both coding priors and generative diffusion priors for high-quality deblurring. First, our coding-prior feature propagation (CPFP) module utilizes MVs for efficient frame alignment and CRs to generate attention masks, addressing motion inaccuracies and texture variations. Second, a coding-prior controlled generation (CPC) module network integrates coding priors into a pretrained diffusion model, guiding it to enhance critical regions and synthesize realistic details. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with up to 30% improvement in IQA metrics. Both the code and the codingprior-augmented dataset will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, resulting from aliasing between object light signals and camera sampling frequencies, often degrade image quality during capture. Traditional demoir\'eing methods have generally treated images as a whole for processing and training, neglecting the unique signal characteristics of different color channels. Moreover, the randomness and variability of moir\'e pattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when applied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME (Self-supervised Image Demoir\'eing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction), a novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively processing moir\'e patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder architecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct images using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key innovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since the green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared to red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is designed to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the generalization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\'e image generation method has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing methods in processing real moir\'e pattern data, showing its superior generalization performance and robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on image models threaten system robustness by introducing imperceptible perturbations that cause incorrect predictions. We investigate human-aligned learned lossy compression as a defense mechanism, comparing two learned models (HiFiC and ELIC) against traditional JPEG across various quality levels. Our experiments on ImageNet subsets demonstrate that learned compression methods outperform JPEG, particularly for Vision Transformer architectures, by preserving semantically meaningful content while removing adversarial noise. Even in white-box settings where attackers can access the defense, these methods maintain substantial effectiveness. We also show that sequential compression--applying rounds of compression/decompression--significantly enhances defense efficacy while maintaining classification performance. Our findings reveal that human-aligned compression provides an effective, computationally efficient defense that protects the image features most relevant to human and machine understanding. It offers a practical approach to improving model robustness against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP. The full codebase and dataset will be available at https://github.com/aplesner/FLIP-Reasoning-Challenge.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT)-based generation models have achieved remarkable success in video generation. However, their inherent computational demands pose significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we exploit the inherent temporal non-uniformity of real-world videos and observe that videos exhibit dynamic information density, with high-motion segments demanding greater detail preservation than static scenes. Inspired by this temporal non-uniformity, we propose VGDFR, a training-free approach for Diffusion-based Video Generation with Dynamic Latent Frame Rate. VGDFR adaptively adjusts the number of elements in latent space based on the motion frequency of the latent space content, using fewer tokens for low-frequency segments while preserving detail in high-frequency segments. Specifically, our key contributions are: (1) A dynamic frame rate scheduler for DiT video generation that adaptively assigns frame rates for video segments. (2) A novel latent-space frame merging method to align latent representations with their denoised counterparts before merging those redundant in low-resolution space. (3) A preference analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) across DiT layers, informing a tailored RoPE strategy optimized for semantic and local information capture. Experiments show that VGDFR can achieve a speedup up to 3x for video generation with minimal quality degradation.

Abstract: We propose CAL (Complete Anything in Lidar) for Lidar-based shape-completion in-the-wild. This is closely related to Lidar-based semantic/panoptic scene completion. However, contemporary methods can only complete and recognize objects from a closed vocabulary labeled in existing Lidar datasets. Different to that, our zero-shot approach leverages the temporal context from multi-modal sensor sequences to mine object shapes and semantic features of observed objects. These are then distilled into a Lidar-only instance-level completion and recognition model. Although we only mine partial shape completions, we find that our distilled model learns to infer full object shapes from multiple such partial observations across the dataset. We show that our model can be prompted on standard benchmarks for Semantic and Panoptic Scene Completion, localize objects as (amodal) 3D bounding boxes, and recognize objects beyond fixed class vocabularies.

Abstract: Deep learning based rendering has demonstrated major improvements for photo-realistic image synthesis, applicable to various applications including visual effects in movies and photo-realistic scene building in video games. However, a significant limitation is the difficulty of decomposing the illumination and material parameters, which limits such methods to reconstruct an input scene, without any possibility to control these parameters. This paper introduces a novel physics based neural deferred shading pipeline to decompose the data-driven rendering process, learn a generalizable shading function to produce photo-realistic results for shading and relighting tasks, we also provide a shadow estimator to efficiently mimic shadowing effect. Our model achieves improved performance compared to classical models and a state-of-art neural shading model, and enables generalizable photo-realistic shading from arbitrary illumination input.

Abstract: We tackle the novel problem of predicting 3D hand motion and contact maps (or Interaction Trajectories) given a single RGB view, action text, and a 3D contact point on the object as input. Our approach consists of (1) Interaction Codebook: a VQVAE model to learn a latent codebook of hand poses and contact points, effectively tokenizing interaction trajectories, (2) Interaction Predictor: a transformer-decoder module to predict the interaction trajectory from test time inputs by using an indexer module to retrieve a latent affordance from the learned codebook. To train our model, we develop a data engine that extracts 3D hand poses and contact trajectories from the diverse HoloAssist dataset. We evaluate our model on a benchmark that is 2.5-10X larger than existing works, in terms of diversity of objects and interactions observed, and test for generalization of the model across object categories, action categories, tasks, and scenes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach over transformer & diffusion baselines across all settings.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images and videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is hard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant 2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of differentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also produces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion classification.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in medical image segmentation, yet their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. In vascular applications, trustworthy segmentation should rely on both local image cues and global anatomical structures, such as vessel connectivity or branching. However, the extent to which models leverage such global context remains unclear. We present a novel explainability pipeline for 3D vessel segmentation, combining gradient-based attribution with graph-guided point selection and a blob-based analysis of Saliency maps. Using vascular graphs extracted from ground truth, we define anatomically meaningful points of interest (POIs) and assess the contribution of input voxels via Saliency maps. These are analyzed at both global and local scales using a custom blob detector. Applied to IRCAD and Bullitt datasets, our analysis shows that model decisions are dominated by highly localized attribution blobs centered near POIs. Attribution features show little correlation with vessel-level properties such as thickness, tubularity, or connectivity -- suggesting limited use of global anatomical reasoning. Our results underline the importance of structured explainability tools and highlight the current limitations of segmentation models in capturing global vascular context.

Abstract: In modern society, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the common mental diseases discovered not only in children but also in adults. In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically, the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows. First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI, ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939 individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this, the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the performance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC 76.60SPE 79.22SEN 79.30AUC)

Abstract: The recovery of severely damaged ancient written documents has proven to be a major challenge for many scientists, mainly due to the impracticality of physical unwrapping them. Non-destructive techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT), combined with computer vision algorithms, have emerged as a means of facilitating the virtual reading of the hidden contents of the damaged documents. This paper proposes an educational laboratory aimed at simulating the entire process of acquisition and virtual recovery of the ancient works. We have developed an experimental setup that uses visible light to replace the detrimental X-rays, and a didactic software pipeline that allows students to virtually reconstruct a transparent rolled sheet with printed text on it, the wrapped scroll.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of abdominal adipose tissue, including subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), along with liver segmentation, is essential for understanding body composition and associated health risks such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study proposes Attention GhostUNet++, a novel deep learning model incorporating Channel, Spatial, and Depth Attention mechanisms into the Ghost UNet++ bottleneck for automated, precise segmentation. Evaluated on the AATTCT-IDS and LiTS datasets, the model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.9430 for VAT, 0.9639 for SAT, and 0.9652 for liver segmentation, surpassing baseline models. Despite minor limitations in boundary detail segmentation, the proposed model significantly enhances feature refinement, contextual understanding, and computational efficiency, offering a robust solution for body composition analysis. The implementation of the proposed Attention GhostUNet++ model is available at:https://github.com/MansoorHayat777/Attention-GhostUNetPlusPlus.

Abstract: Understanding action correspondence between humans and robots is essential for evaluating alignment in decision-making, particularly in human-robot collaboration and imitation learning within unstructured environments. We propose a multimodal demonstration learning framework that explicitly models human demonstrations from RGB video with robot demonstrations in voxelized RGB-D space. Focusing on the "pick and place" task from the RH20T dataset, we utilize data from 5 users across 10 diverse scenes. Our approach combines ResNet-based visual encoding for human intention modeling and a Perceiver Transformer for voxel-based robot action prediction. After 2000 training epochs, the human model reaches 71.67% accuracy, and the robot model achieves 71.8% accuracy, demonstrating the framework's potential for aligning complex, multimodal human and robot behaviors in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of tool-tissue interactions in robotic surgery requires precise tracking of deformable tissues and integration of surgical domain knowledge. Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.

Abstract: The multimodal datasets can be leveraged to pre-train large-scale vision-language models by providing cross-modal semantics. Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is crucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.

Abstract: Active object reconstruction is crucial for many robotic applications. A key aspect in these scenarios is generating object-specific view configurations to obtain informative measurements for reconstruction. One-shot view planning enables efficient data collection by predicting all views at once, eliminating the need for time-consuming online replanning. Our primary insight is to leverage the generative power of 3D diffusion models as valuable prior information. By conditioning on initial multi-view images, we exploit the priors from the 3D diffusion model to generate an approximate object model, serving as the foundation for our view planning. Our novel approach integrates the geometric and textural distributions of the object model into the view planning process, generating views that focus on the complex parts of the object to be reconstructed. We validate the proposed active object reconstruction system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of using 3D diffusion priors for one-shot view planning.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based robotic navigation systems have gained extensive research attention and made significant progress. However, the diversity of open-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such systems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene measurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios deviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose estimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual odometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online manner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework for monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation module. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with lightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then, we construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation module based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual semantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification module and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage camera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks for the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a robot platform.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for 3D content has grown exponentially with intelligent upgrading of interactive media, extended reality (XR), and Metaverse industries. In order to overcome the limitation of traditional manual modeling approaches, such as labor-intensive workflows and prolonged production cycles, revolutionary advances have been achieved through the convergence of novel 3D representation paradigms and artificial intelligence generative technologies. In this survey, we conduct a systematically review of the cutting-edge achievements in static 3D object and scene generation, as well as establish a comprehensive technical framework through systematic categorization. Specifically, we initiate our analysis with mainstream 3D object representations, followed by in-depth exploration of two principal technical pathways in object generation: data-driven supervised learning methods and deep generative model-based approaches. Regarding scene generation, we focus on three dominant paradigms: layout-guided compositional synthesis, 2D prior-based scene generation, and rule-driven modeling. Finally, we critically examine persistent challenges in 3D generation and propose potential research directions for future investigation. This survey aims to provide readers with a structured understanding of state-of-the-art 3D generation technologies while inspiring researchers to undertake more exploration in this domain.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated significant potential in 3D medical image segmentation tasks. However, their high computational cost and inability to fully capture global 3D contextual information limit their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided diffusion model framework, TextDiffSeg. This method leverages a conditional diffusion framework that integrates 3D volumetric data with natural language descriptions, enabling cross-modal embedding and establishing a shared semantic space between visual and textual modalities. By enhancing the model's ability to recognize complex anatomical structures, TextDiffSeg incorporates innovative label embedding techniques and cross-modal attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global 3D contextual integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that TextDiffSeg consistently outperforms existing methods in segmentation tasks involving kidney and pancreas tumors, as well as multi-organ segmentation scenarios. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components, highlighting the synergistic interaction between text fusion, image feature extractor, and label encoder. TextDiffSeg provides an efficient and accurate solution for 3D medical image segmentation, showcasing its broad applicability in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs), allow the attacker to create non-constrained adversarial examples without given clean samples, posing a severe threat to the safety of deep learning models. Recent works utilize diffusion models to generate UAEs. However, these UAEs often lack naturalness and imperceptibility due to simply optimizing in intermediate latent noises. In light of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that explores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful attributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure attack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of generated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three high-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet. The results demonstrate that SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of attack success rate and imperceptibility. The generated UAEs are natural and exhibit semantically meaningful changes, in accord with the attributes' weights. In addition, SemDiff is found capable of evading different defenses, which further validates its effectiveness and threatening.

Abstract: Current sign language machine translation systems rely on recognizing hand movements, facial expressions and body postures, and natural language processing, to convert signs into text. Recent approaches use Transformer architectures to model long-range dependencies via positional encoding. However, they lack accuracy in recognizing fine-grained, short-range temporal dependencies between gestures captured at high frame rates. Moreover, their high computational complexity leads to inefficient training. To mitigate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Transformer (ADAT), which incorporates components for enhanced feature extraction and adaptive feature weighting through a gating mechanism to emphasize contextually relevant features while reducing training overhead and maintaining translation accuracy. To evaluate ADAT, we introduce MedASL, the first public medical American Sign Language dataset. In sign-to-gloss-to-text experiments, ADAT outperforms the encoder-decoder transformer, improving BLEU-4 accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 14.33% on PHOENIX14T and 3.24% on MedASL. In sign-to-text experiments, it improves accuracy by 8.7% and reduces training time by 2.8% on PHOENIX14T and achieves 4.7% higher accuracy and 7.17% faster training on MedASL. Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only baselines in sign-to-text, ADAT is at least 6.8% more accurate despite being up to 12.1% slower due to its dual-stream structure.

Abstract: X-ray imaging plays a crucial role in the medical field, providing essential insights into the internal anatomy of patients for diagnostics, image-guided procedures, and clinical decision-making. Traditional techniques often require multiple X-ray projections from various angles to obtain a comprehensive view, leading to increased radiation exposure and more complex clinical processes. This paper explores an innovative approach using the DL-GIPS model, which synthesizes X-ray projections from new viewpoints by leveraging a single existing projection. The model strategically manipulates geometry and texture features extracted from an initial projection to match new viewing angles. It then synthesizes the final projection by merging these modified geometry features with consistent texture information through an advanced image generation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of the DL-GIPS framework through lung imaging examples, highlighting its potential to revolutionize stereoscopic and volumetric imaging by minimizing the need for extensive data acquisition.

Abstract: A domain (distribution) shift between training and test data often hinders the real-world performance of deep neural networks, necessitating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to bridge this gap. Online source-free UDA has emerged as a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted and target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world nature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts meaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing methods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship between pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled experiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into pseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved with perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables effective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a cross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves superior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our findings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than quantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels is beneficial. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of pseudo-labeling in (online) SF-UniDA and provides actionable insights to drive future advancements in the field.

Abstract: In radiation therapy planning, inaccurate segmentations of organs at risk can result in suboptimal treatment delivery, if left undetected by the clinician. To address this challenge, we developed a denoising autoencoder-based method to detect inaccurate organ segmentations. We applied noise to ground truth organ segmentations, and the autoencoders were tasked to denoise them. Through the application of our method to organ segmentations generated on both MR and CT scans, we demonstrated that the method is independent of imaging modality. By providing reconstructions, our method offers visual information about inaccurate regions of the organ segmentations, leading to more explainable detection of suboptimal segmentations. We compared our method to existing approaches in the literature and demonstrated that it achieved superior performance for the majority of organs.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy, highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful tool for training agents by leveraging expert knowledge, and being able to replicate a given trajectory is an integral part of it. In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are capable of learning powerful representations to tackle complex vision tasks but expose undesirable properties like the over-fitting issue. To this end, regularization techniques like image augmentation are necessary for deep neural networks to generalize well. Nevertheless, most prevalent image augmentation recipes confine themselves to off-the-shelf linear transformations like scale, flip, and colorjitter. Due to their hand-crafted property, these augmentations are insufficient to generate truly hard augmented examples. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of augmentation to regularize the training process. Inspired by the recent success of applying masked image modeling to self-supervised learning, we adopt the self-supervised masked autoencoder to generate the distorted view of the input images. We show that utilizing such model-based nonlinear transformation as data augmentation can improve high-level recognition tasks. We term the proposed method as \textbf{M}ask-\textbf{R}econstruct \textbf{A}ugmentation (MRA). The extensive experiments on various image classification benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation. Specifically, MRA consistently enhances the performance on supervised, semi-supervised as well as few-shot classification.

Abstract: Fully supervised learning has recently achieved promising performance in various electroencephalography (EEG) learning tasks by training on large datasets with ground truth labels. However, labeling EEG data for affective experiments is challenging, as it can be difficult for participants to accurately distinguish between similar emotions, resulting in ambiguous labeling (reporting multiple emotions for one EEG instance). This notion could cause model performance degradation, as the ground truth is hidden within multiple candidate labels. To address this issue, Partial Label Learning (PLL) has been proposed to identify the ground truth from candidate labels during the training phase, and has shown good performance in the computer vision domain. However, PLL methods have not yet been adopted for EEG representation learning or implemented for emotion recognition tasks. In this paper, we adapt and re-implement six state-of-the-art PLL approaches for emotion recognition from EEG on two large emotion datasets (SEED-IV and SEED-V). These datasets contain four and five categories of emotions, respectively. We evaluate the performance of all methods in classical, circumplex-based and real-world experiments. The results show that PLL methods can achieve strong results in affective computing from EEG and achieve comparable performance to fully supervised learning. We also investigate the effect of label disambiguation, a key step in many PLL methods. The results show that in most cases, label disambiguation would benefit the model when the candidate labels are generated based on their similarities to the ground truth rather than obeying a uniform distribution. This finding suggests the potential of using label disambiguation-based PLL methods for circumplex-based and real-world affective tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-condition diffusion pre-training model named SignDiff that can generate human sign language speakers from a skeleton pose. SignDiff has a novel Frame Reinforcement Network called FR-Net, similar to dense human pose estimation work, which enhances the correspondence between text lexical symbols and sign language dense pose frames, reduces the occurrence of multiple fingers in the diffusion model. In addition, we propose a new method for American Sign Language Production (ASLP), which can generate ASL skeletal pose videos from text input, integrating two new improved modules and a new loss function to improve the accuracy and quality of sign language skeletal posture and enhance the ability of the model to train on large-scale data. We propose the first baseline for ASL production and report the scores of 17.19 and 12.85 on BLEU-4 on the How2Sign dev/test sets. We evaluated our model on the previous mainstream dataset PHOENIX14T, and the experiments achieved the SOTA results. In addition, our image quality far exceeds all previous results by 10 percentage points in terms of SSIM.

Abstract: To integrate action recognition into autonomous robotic systems, it is essential to address challenges such as person occlusions-a common yet often overlooked scenario in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. In this work, we propose IosPSTL, a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework designed to handle occlusions. IosPSTL combines a cluster-agnostic KNN imputer with an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) strategy. First, we pre-train the model on occluded skeleton sequences. Then, we introduce a cluster-agnostic KNN imputer that performs semantic grouping using k-means clustering on sequence embeddings. It imputes missing skeleton data by applying K-Nearest Neighbors in the latent space, leveraging nearby sample representations to restore occluded joints. This imputation generates more complete skeleton sequences, which significantly benefits downstream self-supervised models. To further enhance learning, the OPSTL module incorporates Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) to make better use of intact, high-quality skeleton sequences during training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the occluded versions of the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness under challenging conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/cyfml/OPSTL.

Abstract: Man-made 3D shapes are naturally organized in parts and hierarchies; such structures provide important constraints for shape reconstruction and generation. Modeling shape structures is difficult, because there can be multiple hierarchies for a given shape, causing ambiguity, and across different categories the shape structures are correlated with semantics, limiting generalization. We present StructRe, a structure rewriting system, as a novel approach to structured shape modeling. Given a 3D object represented by points and components, StructRe can rewrite it upward into more concise structures, or downward into more detailed structures; by iterating the rewriting process, hierarchies are obtained. Such a localized rewriting process enables probabilistic modeling of ambiguous structures and robust generalization across object categories. We train StructRe on PartNet data and show its generalization to cross-category and multiple object hierarchies, and test its extension to ShapeNet. We also demonstrate the benefits of probabilistic and generalizable structure modeling for shape reconstruction, generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in real-world applications. Existing methods typically focus on feature representations or output-space analysis, often assuming a distribution over these spaces or leveraging gradient norms with respect to model parameters. However, these approaches struggle to distinguish near-OOD samples and often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose GRadient-aware Out-Of-Distribution detection (GROOD), a method that derives an OOD prototype from synthetic samples and computes class prototypes directly from In-distribution (ID) training data. By analyzing the gradients of a nearest-class-prototype loss function concerning an artificial OOD prototype, our approach achieves a clear separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that gradients computed from the OOD prototype enhance the distinction between ID and OOD data, surpassing established baselines in robustness, particularly on ImageNet-1k. These findings highlight the potential of gradient-based methods and prototype-driven approaches in advancing OOD detection within deep neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently capture distributional information, enabling the network to generate multiple samples simultaneously, rather than a single output, may offer an effective way to represent distributions. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with unique properties: more general zero-shot conditional generation and 1D latent representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and its intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. The code is available at https://discrete-distribution-networks.github.io/

Abstract: Defining pathologies automatically from medical images aids the understanding of the emergence and progression of diseases, and such an ability is crucial in clinical diagnostics. However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We conducted primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images, and performed extensive validation across six external datasets encompassing 20 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assessed the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. Extensive experiments show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, have gained popularity for their versatile applicability to various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot object recognition, they perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute recognition. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and to a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this analysis paper, we investigate both phenomena thoroughly. We evaluated off-the-shelf VLMs and while the gap's influence on performance is typically overshadowed by other factors, we find indications that closing the gap indeed leads to improvements. Moreover, we find that, contrary to intuition, only few embedding dimensions drive the gap and that the embedding spaces are differently organized. To allow for a clean study of object bias, we introduce a definition and a corresponding measure of it. Equipped with this tool, we find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes per se. However, why do both phenomena, modality gap and object bias, emerge in the first place? To answer this fundamental question and uncover some of the inner workings of contrastive VLMs, we conducted experiments that allowed us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. These experiments revealed that the driving factor behind both the modality gap and the object bias, is an information imbalance between images and captions, and unveiled an intriguing connection between the modality gap and entropy of the logits.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of embodied multi-agent cooperation, where decentralized agents must cooperate given only egocentric views of the world. To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video conditioned on the world state. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. We evaluate our methods on three challenging benchmarks with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed methods.

Abstract: The advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to a growing interest in autonomous driving to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&amp;A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.

Abstract: We present SceneFactory, a workflow-centric and unified framework for incremental scene modeling, that conveniently supports a wide range of applications, such as (unposed and/or uncalibrated) multi-view depth estimation, LiDAR completion, (dense) RGB-D/RGB-L/Mono/Depth-only reconstruction and SLAM. The workflow-centric design uses multiple blocks as the basis for constructing different production lines. The supported applications, i.e., productions avoid redundancy in their designs. Thus, the focus is placed on each block itself for independent expansion. To support all input combinations, our implementation consists of four building blocks that form SceneFactory: (1) tracking, (2) flexion, (3) depth estimation, and (4) scene reconstruction. The tracking block is based on Mono SLAM and is extended to support RGB-D and RGB-LiDAR (RGB-L) inputs. Flexion is used to convert the depth image (untrackable) into a trackable image. For general-purpose depth estimation, we propose an unposed \& uncalibrated multi-view depth estimation model (U$^2$-MVD) to estimate dense geometry. U$^2$-MVD exploits dense bundle adjustment to solve for poses, intrinsics, and inverse depth. A semantic-aware ScaleCov step is then introduced to complete the multi-view depth. Relying on U$^2$-MVD, SceneFactory both supports user-friendly 3D creation (with just images) and bridges the applications of Dense RGB-D and Dense Mono. For high-quality surface and color reconstruction, we propose Dual-purpose Multi-resolutional Neural Points (DM-NPs) for the first surface accessible Surface Color Field design, where we introduce Improved Point Rasterization (IPR) for point cloud based surface query. ...

Abstract: We introduce a multimodal dataset where users express preferences through images. These images encompass a broad spectrum of visual expressions ranging from landscapes to artistic depictions. Users request recommendations for books or music that evoke similar feelings to those captured in the images, and recommendations are endorsed by the community through upvotes. This dataset supports two recommendation tasks: title generation and multiple-choice selection. Our experiments with large foundation models reveal their limitations in these tasks. Particularly, vision-language models show no significant advantage over language-only counterparts that use descriptions, which we hypothesize is due to underutilized visual capabilities. To better harness these abilities, we propose the chain-of-imagery prompting, which results in notable improvements. We release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain with no access to the source data. Inspired by the success of large Vision-Language (ViL) models in many applications, the latest research has validated ViL's benefit for SFDA by using their predictions as pseudo supervision. However, we observe that ViL's supervision could be noisy and inaccurate at an unknown rate, introducing additional negative effects during adaption. To address this thus-far ignored challenge, we introduce a novel Proxy Denoising (ProDe) approach. The key idea is to leverage the ViL model as a proxy to facilitate the adaptation process towards the latent domain-invariant space. We design a proxy denoising mechanism to correct ViL's predictions, grounded on a proxy confidence theory that models the dynamic effect of proxy's divergence against the domain-invariant space during adaptation. To capitalize on the corrected proxy, we derive a mutual knowledge distilling regularization. Extensive experiments show that ProDe significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art alternatives under the conventional closed set setting and more challenging open set, partial set, generalized SFDA, multi-target, multi-source, and test-time settings. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tntek/source-free-domain-adaptation.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) -- predicting pixel-level regions for objects within each frame of a video -- is particularly challenging in agricultural scenarios, where videos of crops include hundreds of small, dense, and occluded objects (stems, leaves, flowers, pods) that sway and move unpredictably in the wind. Supervised training is the state-of-the-art for VOS, but it requires large, pixel-accurate, human-annotated videos, which are costly to produce for videos with many densely packed objects in each frame. To address these challenges, we proposed a semi-self-supervised spatiotemporal approach for dense-VOS (DVOS) using a diffusion-based method through multi-task (reconstruction and segmentation) learning. We train the model first with synthetic data that mimics the camera and object motion of real videos and then with pseudo-labeled videos. We evaluate our DVOS method for wheat head segmentation from a diverse set of videos (handheld, drone-captured, different field locations, and different growth stages -- spanning from Boot-stage to Wheat-mature and Harvest-ready). Despite using only a few manually annotated video frames, the proposed approach yielded a high-performing model, achieving a Dice score of 0.79 when tested on a drone-captured external test set. While our method was evaluated on wheat head segmentation, it can be extended to other crops and domains, such as crowd analysis or microscopic image analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at https://bigearth.net.

Abstract: Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.

Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications. The RSTeller dataset is available at https://github.com/SlytherinGe/RSTeller.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) endeavors to bridge the gap between a model trained on a labeled source domain and its deployment in an unlabeled target domain. However, current high-performance models demand significant resources, making deployment costs prohibitive and highlighting the need for compact, yet effective models. For UDA of lightweight models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) leveraging a Teacher-Student framework could be a common approach, but we found that domain shift in UDA leads to a significant increase in non-salient parameters in the teacher model, degrading model's generalization ability and transferring misleading information to the student model. Interestingly, we observed that this phenomenon occurs considerably less in the student model. Driven by this insight, we introduce Collaborative Learning for UDA (CLDA), a method that updates the teacher's non-salient parameters using the student model and at the same time utilizes the updated teacher model to improve UDA performance of the student model. Experiments show consistent performance improvements for both student and teacher models. For example, in semantic segmentation, CLDA achieves an improvement of +0.7% mIoU for the teacher model and +1.4% mIoU for the student model compared to the baseline model in the GTA-to-Cityscapes datasets. In the Synthia-to-Cityscapes dataset, it achieves an improvement of +0.8% mIoU and +2.0% mIoU for the teacher and student models, respectively.

Abstract: Reconstructing posed 3D human models from monocular images has important applications in the sports industry, including performance tracking, injury prevention and virtual training. In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

Abstract: Deep learning-based person re-identification (re-id) models are widely employed in surveillance systems and inevitably inherit the vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial attacks. Existing attacks merely consider cross-dataset and cross-model transferability, ignoring the cross-test capability to perturb models trained in different domains. To powerfully examine the robustness of real-world re-id models, the Meta Transferable Generative Attack (MTGA) method is proposed, which adopts meta-learning optimization to promote the generative attacker producing highly transferable adversarial examples by learning comprehensively simulated transfer-based cross-model\&amp;dataset\&amp;test black-box meta attack tasks. Specifically, cross-model\&amp;dataset black-box attack tasks are first mimicked by selecting different re-id models and datasets for meta-train and meta-test attack processes. As different models may focus on different feature regions, the Perturbation Random Erasing module is further devised to prevent the attacker from learning to only corrupt model-specific features. To boost the attacker learning to possess cross-test transferability, the Normalization Mix strategy is introduced to imitate diverse feature embedding spaces by mixing multi-domain statistics of target models. Extensive experiments show the superiority of MTGA, especially in cross-model\&amp;dataset and cross-model\&amp;dataset\&amp;test attacks, our MTGA outperforms the SOTA methods by 21.5\% and 11.3\% on mean mAP drop rate, respectively. The code of MTGA will be released after the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Capturing real-world aerial images for vision-based navigation (VBN) is challenging due to limited availability and conditions that make it nearly impossible to access all desired images from any location. The complexity increases when multiple locations are involved. State-of-the-art solutions, such as deploying UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for aerial imaging or relying on existing research databases, come with significant limitations. TerrAInav Sim offers a compelling alternative by simulating a UAV to capture bird's-eye view map-based images at zero yaw with real-world visible-band specifications. This open-source tool allows users to specify the bounding box (top-left and bottom-right) coordinates of any region on a map. Without the need to physically fly a drone, the virtual Python UAV performs a raster search to capture images. Users can define parameters such as the flight altitude, aspect ratio, diagonal field of view of the camera, and the overlap between consecutive images. TerrAInav Sim's capabilities range from capturing a few low-altitude images for basic applications to generating extensive datasets of entire cities for complex tasks like deep learning. This versatility makes TerrAInav a valuable tool for not only VBN but also other applications, including environmental monitoring, construction, and city management. The open-source nature of the tool also allows for the extension of the raster search to other missions. A dataset of Memphis, TN, has been provided along with this simulator. A supplementary dataset is also provided, which includes data from a 3D world generation package for comparison.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a cut-edge area of research in generative computer vision, with promising applications in video creation, game development, and robotic manipulation. The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the go-to dataset, BABEL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a reduction of more than 57% in FID and 70% parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions</title>

Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.

Abstract: Text-based generation and editing of 3D scenes hold significant potential for streamlining content creation through intuitive user interactions. While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.

<title>Orthus: Autoregressive Interleaved Image-Text Generation with Modality-Specific Heads</title>

Abstract: We introduce Orthus, an autoregressive (AR) transformer that excels in generating images given textual prompts, answering questions based on visual inputs, and even crafting lengthy image-text interleaved contents. Unlike prior arts on unified multimodal modeling, Orthus simultaneously copes with discrete text tokens and continuous image features under the AR modeling principle. The continuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both image understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the characterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key mechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its modality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts discrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features conditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for building Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in the existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion head, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an Orthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours). Orthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved images and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including Show-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of 0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters. Orthus also shows exceptional mixed-modality generation capabilities, reflecting the potential for handling intricate practical generation tasks.

Abstract: Score distillation of 2D diffusion models has proven to be a powerful mechanism to guide 3D optimization, for example enabling text-based 3D generation or single-view reconstruction. A common limitation of existing score distillation formulations, however, is that the outputs of the (mode-seeking) optimization are limited in diversity despite the underlying diffusion model being capable of generating diverse samples. In this work, inspired by the sampling process in denoising diffusion, we propose a score formulation that guides the optimization to follow generation paths defined by random initial seeds, thus ensuring diversity. We then present an approximation to adopt this formulation for scenarios where the optimization may not precisely follow the generation paths (\eg a 3D representation whose renderings evolve in a co-dependent manner). We showcase the applications of our `Diverse Score Distillation' (DSD) formulation across tasks such as 2D optimization, text-based 3D inference, and single-view reconstruction. We also empirically validate DSD against prior score distillation formulations and show that it significantly improves sample diversity while preserving fidelity.

<title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a prevalent technique in self-supervised vision representation learning, typically generating positive pairs by applying two data augmentations to the same image. Designing effective data augmentation strategies is crucial for the success of contrastive learning. Inspired by the story of the blind men and the elephant, we introduce JointCrop and JointBlur. These methods generate more challenging positive pairs by leveraging the joint distribution of the two augmentation parameters, thereby enabling contrastive learning to acquire more effective feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explicitly incorporate the joint distribution of two data augmentation parameters into contrastive learning. As a plug-and-play framework without additional computational overhead, JointCrop and JointBlur enhance the performance of SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v1, MoCo v2, MoCo v3, SimSiam, and Dino baselines with notable improvements.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/CVL-hub/KAG-prompt.git.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains a critical challenge in the field of computer vision, particularly in data-scarce environments. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained visual-language models, such as CLIP. However, due to the modality gap, which is the inconsistent distribution of image and text features in the joint embedding space, directly using these features as class prototypes often leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Mapping (CMM) method. This method globally aligns image features with the text feature space through linear transformation and optimizes their local spatial relationships using triplet loss, thereby significantly enhancing cross-modal consistency. Experimental results show that compared to other methods, CMM simplifies the training process and demonstrates higher efficiency. Furthermore, CMM improves the average Top-1 accuracy by 1.06% on 11 benchmark datasets compared to methods that partially fine-tune the backbone, and it performs excellently on 4 distribution shift datasets. Notably, CMM effectively mitigates the modality gap in pre-trained models, enabling text features to serve as effective class prototypes for image features, thus providing an efficient and highly generalizable solution for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) holds great promise in addressing challenges associated with long video understanding. These methods retrieve useful moments from long videos for their presented tasks, thereby enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality answers in a cost-effective way. In this work, we present MomentSeeker, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate retrieval models' performance in handling general long-video moment retrieval (LVMR) tasks. MomentSeeker offers three key advantages. First, it incorporates long videos of over 500 seconds on average, making it the first benchmark specialized for long-video moment retrieval. Second, it covers a wide range of task categories (including Moment Search, Caption Alignment, Image-conditioned Moment Search, and Video-conditioned Moment Search) and diverse application scenarios (e.g., sports, movies, cartoons, and ego), making it a comprehensive tool for assessing retrieval models' general LVMR performance. Additionally, the evaluation tasks are carefully curated through human annotation, ensuring the reliability of assessment. We further fine-tune an MLLM-based LVMR retriever on synthetic data, which demonstrates strong performance on our benchmark. We perform extensive experiments with various popular multimodal retrievers based on our benchmark, whose results highlight the challenges of LVMR and limitations for existing methods. Our created resources will be shared with community to advance future research in this field.

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show amazing abilities in assisting human-computer interaction, automating human user's navigation on digital devices. An ideal GUI agent is expected to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility for different GUI platforms. Recent vision-based approaches have shown promise by leveraging advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs). While they generally meet the requirements of compatibility and low latency, these vision-based GUI agents tend to have low accuracy due to their limitations in element grounding. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{SpiritSight}$, a vision-based, end-to-end GUI agent that excels in GUI navigation tasks across various GUI platforms. First, we create a multi-level, large-scale, high-quality GUI dataset called $\textbf{GUI-Lasagne}$ using scalable methods, empowering SpiritSight with robust GUI understanding and grounding capabilities. Second, we introduce the $\textbf{Universal Block Parsing (UBP)}$ method to resolve the ambiguity problem in dynamic high-resolution of visual inputs, further enhancing SpiritSight's ability to ground GUI objects. Through these efforts, SpiritSight agent outperforms other advanced methods on diverse GUI benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability and compatibility in GUI navigation tasks.

Abstract: In filmmaking, directors typically allow actors to perform freely based on the script before providing specific guidance on how to present key actions. AI-generated content faces similar requirements, where users not only need automatic generation of lip synchronization and basic gestures from audio input but also desire semantically accurate and expressive body movement that can be ``directly guided'' through text descriptions. Therefore, we present VersaAnimator, a versatile framework that synthesizes expressive talking human videos from arbitrary portrait images. Specifically, we design a motion generator that produces basic rhythmic movements from audio input and supports text-prompt control for specific actions. The generated whole-body 3D motion tokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads, half-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates photorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial expressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses. Furthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion tokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from direct 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body movements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes lip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and semantically meaningful whole-body motions.

Abstract: The raster-ordered image token sequence exhibits a significant Euclidean distance between index-adjacent tokens at line breaks, making it unsuitable for autoregressive generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes Direction-Aware Diagonal Autoregressive Image Generation (DAR) method, which generates image tokens following a diagonal scanning order. The proposed diagonal scanning order ensures that tokens with adjacent indices remain in close proximity while enabling causal attention to gather information from a broader range of directions. Additionally, two direction-aware modules: 4D-RoPE and direction embeddings are introduced, enhancing the model's capability to handle frequent changes in generation direction. To leverage the representational capacity of the image tokenizer, we use its codebook as the image token embeddings. We propose models of varying scales, ranging from 485M to 2.0B. On the 256$\times$256 ImageNet benchmark, our DAR-XL (2.0B) outperforms all previous autoregressive image generators, achieving a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of text-conditioned streaming motion generation, which requires us to predict the next-step human pose based on variable-length historical motions and incoming texts. Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

Abstract: Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

Abstract: Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences

<title>OpenSDI: Spotting Diffusion-Generated Images in the Open World</title>

arXiv:2503.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper identifies OpenSDI, a challenge for spotting diffusion-generated images in open-world settings. In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/iamwangyabin/OpenSDI.

Abstract: Scene flow estimation aims to recover per-point motion from two adjacent LiDAR scans. However, in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, points rarely move independently of others, especially for nearby points belonging to the same object, which often share the same motion. Incorporating this locally rigid motion constraint has been a key challenge in self-supervised scene flow estimation, which is often addressed by post-processing or appending extra regularization. While these approaches are able to improve the rigidity of predicted flows, they lack an architectural inductive bias for local rigidity within the model structure, leading to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior performance. In contrast, we enforce local rigidity with a lightweight add-on module in neural network design, enabling end-to-end learning. We design a discretized voting space that accommodates all possible translations and then identify the one shared by nearby points by differentiable voting. Additionally, to ensure computational efficiency, we operate on pillars rather than points and learn representative features for voting per pillar. We plug the Voting Module into popular model designs and evaluate its benefit on Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets. We outperform baseline works with only marginal compute overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/tudelft-iv/VoteFlow.

Abstract: The advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to a growing interest in autonomous driving to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&amp;A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.

Abstract: Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) enables robust single-object tracking using segmentation. To extend this to multi-object tracking (MOT), we propose SAM2MOT, introducing a novel Tracking by Segmentation paradigm. Unlike Tracking by Detection or Tracking by Query, SAM2MOT directly generates tracking boxes from segmentation masks, reducing reliance on detection accuracy. SAM2MOT has two key advantages: zero-shot generalization, allowing it to work across datasets without fine-tuning, and strong object association, inherited from SAM2. To further improve performance, we integrate a trajectory manager system for precise object addition and removal, and a cross-object interaction module to handle occlusions. Experiments on DanceTrack, UAVDT, and BDD100K show state-of-the-art results. Notably, SAM2MOT outperforms existing methods on DanceTrack by +2.1 HOTA and +4.5 IDF1, highlighting its effectiveness in MOT. Code is available at https://github.com/TripleJoy/SAM2MOT.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new diffusion-based method for video frame interpolation (VFI), in the context of traditional hand-made animation. We introduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the interpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training process, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the animation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and generalize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the super-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number of diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is that we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a pixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could be useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive comparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model outperforms these models on animation videos. Our code is available at https://github.com/VicFonch/Multi-Input-Resshift-Diffusion-VFI.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a technique that allows us to adapt powerful Foundation Models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks while preserving and unleashing their inherent capabilities. However, we have observed that existing PEFT methods, which are often designed with natural imagery in mind, struggle when applied to Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios. This is primarily due to their inability to handle artifact influences, a problem particularly severe in RS image features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Earth-Adapter, the first PEFT method specifically designed for RS artifacts conquering. Earth-Adapter introduces a novel Mixture of Frequency Adaptation process that combines a Mixture of Adapter (MoA) with Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). By utilizing DFT, Earth-Adapter can decompose features into different frequency components, precisely separating artifacts from original features. The MoA then dynamically assigns weights to each adapter expert, allowing for the combination of features across various frequency domains. These simple-yet-effective approaches enable Earth-Adapter to more efficiently overcome the disturbances caused by artifacts than previous PEFT methods, significantly enhancing the FMs' performance on RS scenarios. Experiments on Domain Adaptation (DA), and Domain Generalization (DG) semantic segmentation benchmarks showcase the Earth-Adapter's effectiveness. Compared with baseline Rein, Earth-Adapter significantly improves 9.0% mIoU in DA and 3.1% mIoU in DG benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/VisionXLab/Earth-Adapter.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the \emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain \emph{diffusion timesteps} and \emph{spatial regions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \textbf{Dy}namic \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that \emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \emph{timestep} and \emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \emph{Timestep-wise Dynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a \emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic Token} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly accelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further enhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with flow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT.

Abstract: Video prediction (VP) generates future frames by leveraging spatial representations and temporal context from past frames. Traditional recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models enhance memory cell structures to capture spatiotemporal states over extended durations but suffer from gradual loss of object appearance details. To address this issue, we propose the strong recollection VP (SRVP) model, which integrates standard attention (SA) and reinforced feature attention (RFA) modules. Both modules employ scaled dot-product attention to extract temporal context and spatial correlations, which are then fused to enhance spatiotemporal representations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SRVP mitigates image quality degradation in RNN-based models while achieving predictive performance comparable to RNN-free architectures.

Abstract: Brain decoding currently faces significant challenges in individual differences, modality alignment, and high-dimensional embeddings. To address individual differences, researchers often use source subject data, which leads to issues such as privacy leakage and heavy data storage burdens. In modality alignment, current works focus on aligning the softmax probability distribution but neglect the alignment of marginal probability distributions, resulting in modality misalignment. Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma. To overcome these limitations, we propose a source-free domain adaptation-based brain decoding framework.

Abstract: Although Mamba models significantly improve hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, one critical challenge is the difficulty in building the sequence of Mamba tokens efficiently. This paper presents a Sparse Deformable Mamba (SDMamba) approach for enhanced HSI classification, with the following contributions. First, to enhance Mamba sequence, an efficient Sparse Deformable Sequencing (SDS) approach is designed to adaptively learn the ''optimal" sequence, leading to sparse and deformable Mamba sequence with increased detail preservation and decreased computations. Second, to boost spatial-spectral feature learning, based on SDS, a Sparse Deformable Spatial Mamba Module (SDSpaM) and a Sparse Deformable Spectral Mamba Module (SDSpeM) are designed for tailored modeling of the spatial information spectral information. Last, to improve the fusion of SDSpaM and SDSpeM, an attention based feature fusion approach is designed to integrate the outputs of the SDSpaM and SDSpeM. The proposed method is tested on several benchmark datasets with many state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating that the proposed approach can achieve higher accuracy with less computation, and better detail small-class preservation capability.

Abstract: Automated facial expression quality assessment (FEQA) in neurological disorders is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient care, yet effectively capturing the subtle motions and nuances of facial muscle movements remains a challenge. We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%). Our ablation studies further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of landmark trajectories in FEQA. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuchaoduan/TraMP-Former.

Abstract: The oracle bone inscription (OBI) recognition plays a significant role in understanding the history and culture of ancient China. However, the existing OBI datasets suffer from a long-tail distribution problem, leading to biased performance of OBI recognition models across majority and minority classes. With recent advancements in generative models, OBI synthesis-based data augmentation has become a promising avenue to expand the sample size of minority classes. Unfortunately, current OBI datasets lack large-scale structure-aligned image pairs for generative model training. To address these problems, we first present the Oracle-P15K, a structure-aligned OBI dataset for OBI generation and denoising, consisting of 14,542 images infused with domain knowledge from OBI experts. Second, we propose a diffusion model-based pseudo OBI generator, called OBIDiff, to achieve realistic and controllable OBI generation. Given a clean glyph image and a target rubbing-style image, it can effectively transfer the noise style of the original rubbing to the glyph image. Extensive experiments on OBI downstream tasks and user preference studies show the effectiveness of the proposed Oracle-P15K dataset and demonstrate that OBIDiff can accurately preserve inherent glyph structures while transferring authentic rubbing styles effectively.

Abstract: Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Audio-visual saliency prediction aims to mimic human visual attention by identifying salient regions in videos through the integration of both visual and auditory information. Although visual-only approaches have significantly advanced, effectively incorporating auditory cues remains challenging due to complex spatio-temporal interactions and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Token Fusion Saliency (DFTSal), a novel audio-visual saliency prediction framework designed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency. Our approach features a multi-scale visual encoder equipped with two novel modules: the Learnable Token Enhancement Block (LTEB), which adaptively weights tokens to emphasize crucial saliency cues, and the Dynamic Learnable Token Fusion Block (DLTFB), which employs a shifting operation to reorganize and merge features, effectively capturing long-range dependencies and detailed spatial information. In parallel, an audio branch processes raw audio signals to extract meaningful auditory features. Both visual and audio features are integrated using our Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Block (AMFB), which employs local, global, and adaptive fusion streams for precise cross-modal fusion. The resulting fused features are processed by a hierarchical multi-decoder structure, producing accurate saliency maps. Extensive evaluations on six audio-visual benchmarks demonstrate that DFTSal achieves SOTA performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) show remarkable performance in visual reasoning tasks, successfully tackling college-level challenges that require high-level understanding of images. However, some recent reports of VLMs struggling to reason about elemental visual concepts like orientation, position, continuity, and occlusion suggest a potential gulf between human and VLM vision. Here we use the toolkit of neuropsychology to systematically assess the capabilities of three state-of-the-art VLMs across visual domains. Using 51 tests drawn from six clinical and experimental batteries, we characterise the visual abilities of leading VLMs relative to normative performance in healthy adults. While the models excel in straightforward object recognition tasks, we find widespread deficits in low- and mid-level visual abilities that would be considered clinically significant in humans. These selective deficits, profiled through validated test batteries, suggest that an artificial system can achieve complex object recognition without developing foundational visual concepts that in humans require no explicit training.

Abstract: Accurate rib fracture identification and classification are essential for treatment planning. However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification. Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions, accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.

Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.

Abstract: The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

Abstract: The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task is important for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and providing high-quality data sources for LLM training data. While state-of-the-art VLMs show improved average OCR accuracy, they still struggle with sample-level quality degradation and lack reliable automatic detection of low-quality outputs. We introduce Consensus Entropy (CE), a training-free post-inference method that quantifies OCR uncertainty by aggregating outputs from multiple VLMs. Our approach exploits a key insight: correct VLM OCR predictions converge in output space while errors diverge. We develop a lightweight multi-model framework that effectively identifies problematic samples, selects the best outputs and combines model strengths. Experiments across multiple OCR benchmarks and VLMs demonstrate that CE outperforms VLM-as-judge approaches and single-model baselines at the same cost and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. For instance, our solution demonstrates: achieving 15.2% higher F1 scores than VLM-as-judge methods in quality verification, delivering 6.0% accuracy gains on mathematical calculation tasks, and requiring rephrasing only 7.3% of inputs while maintaining overall performance. Notably, the entire process requires neither training nor supervision while maintaining plug-and-play functionality throughout.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.

Abstract: Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate engineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training, data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed methodology is also applicable to other complex design domains. The dataset is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International(CC BY-NC 4.0) and is available on the https://www.smartdesignlab.org/datasets

Abstract: The application of diffusion models in 3D LiDAR scene completion is limited due to diffusion's slow sampling speed. Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation. Our code is public available on https://github.com/happyw1nd/DistillationDPO.

Abstract: A significant portion of roads, particularly in densely populated developing countries, lacks explicitly defined right-of-way rules. These understructured roads pose substantial challenges for autonomous vehicle motion planning, where efficient and safe navigation relies on understanding decentralized human coordination for collision avoidance. This coordination, often termed "social driving etiquette," remains underexplored due to limited open-source empirical data and suitable modeling frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel dataset and modeling framework designed to study motion planning in these understructured environments. The dataset includes 20 aerial videos of representative scenarios, an image dataset for training vehicle detection models, and a development kit for vehicle trajectory estimation. We demonstrate that a consensus-based modeling approach can effectively explain the emergence of priority orders observed in our dataset, and is therefore a viable framework for decentralized collision avoidance planning.

Abstract: Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization.

<title>Strategic Client Selection to Address Non-IIDness in HAPS-enabled FL Networks</title>

Abstract: The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.

Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Prior theory work on Contrastive Learning via the InfoNCE loss showed that, under certain assumptions, the learned representations recover the ground-truth latent factors. We argue that these theories overlook crucial aspects of how CL is deployed in practice. Specifically, they either assume equal variance across all latents or that certain latents are kept invariant. However, in practice, positive pairs are often generated using augmentations such as strong cropping to just a few pixels. Hence, a more realistic assumption is that all latent factors change with a continuum of variability across all factors. We introduce AnInfoNCE, a generalization of InfoNCE that can provably uncover the latent factors in this anisotropic setting, broadly generalizing previous identifiability results in CL. We validate our identifiability results in controlled experiments and show that AnInfoNCE increases the recovery of previously collapsed information in CIFAR10 and ImageNet, albeit at the cost of downstream accuracy. Finally, we discuss the remaining mismatches between theoretical assumptions and practical implementations.

Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It outlines future research directions and emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models offer a promising framework for robotic perception and planning by processing sensory inputs to generate actionable plans. However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans.
  To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems. Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://uncertainty-in-planning.github.io/.

Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.

<title>Improving Generalization of Universal Adversarial Perturbation via Dynamic Maximin Optimization</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs). These perturbations are meticulously designed to fool the target model universally across all sample classes. Unlike instance-specific adversarial examples (AEs), generating UAPs is more complex because they must be generalized across a wide range of data samples and models. Our research reveals that existing universal attack methods, which optimize UAPs using DNNs with static model parameter snapshots, do not fully leverage the potential of DNNs to generate more effective UAPs. Rather than optimizing UAPs against static DNN models with a fixed training set, we suggest using dynamic model-data pairs to generate UAPs. In particular, we introduce a dynamic maximin optimization strategy, aiming to optimize the UAP across a variety of optimal model-data pairs. We term this approach DM-UAP. DM-UAP utilizes an iterative max-min-min optimization framework that refines the model-data pairs, coupled with a curriculum UAP learning algorithm to examine the combined space of model parameters and data thoroughly. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed DM-UAP markedly enhances both cross-sample universality and cross-model transferability of UAPs. Using only 500 samples for UAP generation, DM-UAP outperforms the state-of-the-art approach with an average increase in fooling ratio of 12.108%.

Abstract: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of ADAPT (Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its continuous performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.

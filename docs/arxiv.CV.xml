<div> Label Smoothing++, neural networks, overconfidence, overfitting, inter-class relationships <br>
Summary: <br>
Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often leads to overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing is a technique that addresses this issue by introducing regularization through perturbing the one-hot target labels. However, traditional label smoothing assigns equal importance to all non-target classes, which can disrupt inter-class relationships. In this study, a novel label regularization strategy called Label Smoothing++ is introduced. This approach maintains a fixed label for the target class while allowing the network to learn the labels associated with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, Label Smoothing++ is shown to reduce overconfident predictions, enhance inter-class relationships, and improve generalization capabilities of neural networks. <div>

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Summary: 
This thesis introduces "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection," a novel approach that combines Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) methods with Visual Analytics (VA) to improve Object Detection (OD) model performance. By integrating human expertise and intuition throughout the machine learning process, VILOD aims to make the annotation workflow more transparent, manageable, and effective. The tool incorporates components like t-SNE projections, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views to enable users to explore data, interpret model states, implement diverse sample selection strategies, and receive Active Learning (AL) suggestions. Empirical research conducted using comparative use cases demonstrated that visually-guided labeling strategies within VILOD can lead to competitive OD performance trajectories compared to traditional AL methods. This work provides valuable insights into enhancing the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation, offering a potentially more efficient and intuitive approach to dataset labeling. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA), effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration. This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection". VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features, together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD, through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective.

Summary: 
Knowledge distillation (KD) is enhanced through the Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework introduced in this study. The traditional method uses a fixed alpha parameter, but the proposed approach uses a learnable alpha to dynamically adjust the balance between hard-label cross-entropy loss and soft-label distillation loss during training. The AKD framework incorporates a formula that computes alpha based on student-teacher discrepancies, along with a Context-Aware Module (CAM) utilizing MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as student demonstrate that AKD outperforms fixed-weight KD baselines in terms of accuracy and convergence stability. This framework offers a more effective and efficient approach to knowledge distillation, particularly in scenarios where the optimal trade-off between hard and soft supervision may vary during the training process. <br> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework. First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically, guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

<div> Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs), edge-centric network measures, pruning, COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, compression ratio

Summary: 
Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) are studied for their network topology impact on learning efficiency and model performance. The study focuses on three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC) for compressing RWNNs while maintaining performance. RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, and the measures are integrated across Erdős-Rényi (ER), Watts-Strogatz (WS), and Barabási-Albert (BA) models. The study compares the pruning performance of the measures in terms of compression ratio and speedup, evaluating FRC's efficiency and effectiveness. Structural properties of the pruned networks are analyzed in terms of modularity and global efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency. Results show that FRC-based pruning can simplify RWNNs with computational advantages comparable to ORC. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and models.

<div> Keywords: object recognition, domain shift, synthetic dataset, multimodal evidence, self critique loop

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by object recognition models in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. These shifts can include changes in image statistics, object pose, occlusions, and visual confusion. To address this issue, the Re-Thinking Vision Language Model (RT-VLM) framework is proposed. It utilizes a synthetic dataset generation pipeline to create images annotated with "4-Clues": bounding boxes, class names, object-level captions, and context-level captions. The Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct model is then supervised tuned using this dataset. During inference, a two-stage Re-Thinking scheme is employed, where the model first generates its own clues and then corrects them iteratively. RT-VLM outperforms strong baselines in robustness benchmarks for individual domain shifts, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating structured multimodal evidence with a self-critique loop in improving visual understanding.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass (i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with "4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions, and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel, cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels to analyze and improve their game.

<div> Keywords: Chinese handwriting, orthographic predictors, phonological factors, OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, large-scale handwriting database

Summary:
Orthographic and phonological factors play a significant role in Chinese handwriting at the character, radical, and stroke levels. The study involved 42 Chinese speakers handwriting 1200 characters using an upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for data capture and batch-processing. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that orthographic predictors impacted handwriting preparation and execution, with phonological factors also influencing execution across all levels. These linguistic effects displayed hierarchical attenuation, with the strongest impact at the character level, followed by the radical, and weakest at the stroke level. The findings emphasize the interplay between linguistic components and handwriting at different levels. The large-scale database and toolbox created in this study provide valuable resources for future research in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, enabling further investigation into handwriting of characters and sub-characters across various languages.

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical, and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally, we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters and sub-characters across different languages.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach for anticipatory fall detection in humans using a hybrid model of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By separating the tasks of motion prediction and gait classification, the model achieves high accuracy in anticipating falls. Real-time skeletal features from video sequences are utilized for input, with the DGNN classifying gait states and the LSTM predicting human movements. This decoupled approach outperforms models solely relying on DGNN and those in existing literature, demonstrating superior prediction error and recognition accuracy. The method not only facilitates early fall detection but also allows for monitoring the transient state between stability and an impending fall, providing valuable insights for improving assistive robotic systems. Overall, the proposed model offers a promising solution for enhancing fall detection capabilities in assistive technology.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls, the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states: stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state, offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced assistance systems.

Summary:<br>
Segmentation of brain tumors from MRI is challenging due to heterogeneous morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation is crucial for treatment planning and monitoring. A comparative analysis of K-Means and FCM clustering paradigms was conducted using the BraTS2020 dataset with preprocessing. K-Means assigns each pixel to a single cluster, while FCM allows partial memberships. Results showed K-Means is faster (0.3s/image) but less accurate (DSC 0.43), while FCM is more precise (DSC 0.67) but slower (1.3s/image). The study highlights a trade-off between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association. Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset, incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of 0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Accurate classification of pests and diseases is crucial in precision agriculture for targeted interventions and prevention of spread. Existing methods often focus on binary classification, limiting practical applications where specific identification is necessary. A robust deep learning model for multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests is proposed. Enhancing a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with attention-based modules and utilizing comprehensive data augmentation techniques helps mitigate class imbalance. The model achieves an impressive 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image datasets, outperforming other approaches. This integrated approach demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in accurately identifying and categorizing onion crop diseases and pests in precision agriculture applications.

Summary:
Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF) is a new framework for text-to-image editing that addresses over-smoothing artifacts by modeling the discrepancy between source and target velocity fields. It includes a time-dependent shift term to improve alignment with the target distribution.

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free, path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however, conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets. Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications, including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving. Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes, ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools (Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the same observed features.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs. To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset consisting of MRI scans from 369 brain tumor patients. The preliminary result obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.

<div> latent generative models, image synthesis, wavelet-based, frequency-aware, variational autoencoder

Summary:
The article explores the limitations of existing latent tokenizers used in image synthesis models, revealing a bias towards low-frequency information that results in over-smoothed and visually unappealing outputs. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel approach called frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) that separates the optimization of low and high-frequency components. By decoupling these frequencies, fine textures can be reconstructed more effectively while preserving the overall structure of the image. This approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers, emphasizing the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation. The FA-VAE framework has implications for a range of applications including content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging. <div>
arXiv:2509.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion, and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics, identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70 percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70 percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy, surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Summary: 
This research investigates the impact of different layer-freezing configurations on YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures for real-time object detection in resource-constrained environments like UAVs. Various freezing strategies are analyzed across datasets representing critical infrastructure monitoring, utilizing gradient analysis and visual explanations to understand training dynamics. Results show that the optimal freezing strategy depends on dataset characteristics, with freezing the backbone preserving general features and shallower freezes handling class imbalances effectively. These configurations reduce GPU memory consumption by up to 28% and achieve high mAP@50 scores compared to full fine-tuning. Gradient analysis demonstrates distinct convergence patterns for moderately frozen models, offering practical guidelines for balanced transfer learning in limited resource scenarios. Ultimately, this work provides evidence-based recommendations for selecting freezing strategies in object detection tasks.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth, dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but, rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical, evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in scenarios with limited resources.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO, DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently surpassing existing works.

Summary: <br>
This paper presents a novel contrastive representation learning framework for enhancing human action segmentation. The framework focuses on leveraging multi-scale representations and cross-sequence variations by pre-training on trimmed skeleton sequences. A data augmentation strategy called 'Shuffle and Warp' is introduced to exploit diverse multi-action permutations. Two surrogate tasks, Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR), are proposed in the contrastive learning process to learn intra-class similarities and inter-class contexts. The Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network, optimized for action segmentation, shows significant performance improvements over existing methods in multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Ablation studies are conducted to assess the individual contributions of each component of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting representations of the same action class across different permutations, while ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach.

<div> Sparse event cameras Motion deblurring RED network Robustness Disentangled representation<br>
Summary:<br>
Event cameras capture sparse motion information at high temporal resolution, making them promising for motion deblurring. However, the inherent incompleteness of event streams due to sensor thresholding compromises motion priors. To address this, a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation is proposed. A Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) introduces random masking to events to enhance robustness under various conditions. An OmniAttention module explicitly models correlations within and between motion and modalities. Interactive modules enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject context into incomplete event representations. RED achieves top performance in accuracy and robustness on synthetic and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming challenges in event-guided deblurring. <br> <div>

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters, leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a 20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline, with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes, richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image (\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$ image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability, and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The dataset and additional details are publicly available at {https://github.com/inclusionConf/MFFI}.

<div> Video summarization, language-guided, spatiotemporal graph modeling, objects, frames<br>
Summary:<br>
Video summarization is enhanced by considering fine-grained visual entities like objects and utilizing language queries to understand complex videos. The VideoGraph approach models videos as spatiotemporal graphs, with objects and frames represented as nodes connected by edges defining semantic relationships. Language queries are incorporated into node representations to enhance semantic knowledge and distinguish edges based on visual similarity. A recursive strategy refines graphs for accurate keyframe classification. VideoGraph outperforms existing methods in generic and query-focused video summarization for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. The code is accessible at the provided GitHub repository. <div>
arXiv:2509.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs, respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe. In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised and unsupervised manners.

Summary: 
This article introduces a framework for dense representation learning that enhances spatial precision and fine-grained detail in vision tasks. While existing self-supervised methods focus on global representations, this approach aims to capture localized semantics necessary for dense prediction tasks. The proposed method aligns distributions of dense features between teacher and student models through Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), capturing statistical dependencies and matching structural relationships of dense patches.

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel method for effectively and robustly erasing narrow concepts in images such as copyrighted characters or celebrities. SuMa derives a target subspace representing the concept to be erased and maps it to a reference subspace to ensure robust erasure while maintaining image quality. The method is tested across various tasks including subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure, demonstrating comparable image quality to approaches focused on effectiveness. SuMa's results are also on par with methods targeting completeness. This novel approach addresses concerns regarding the misuse of text-to-image models and provides a solution for erasing narrow concepts in images to comply with copyright and legal requirements. <div>

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed. However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.

Summary:
EditIDv2 is a tuning-free solution designed for complex narrative scenes and lengthy text inputs. Existing character editing methods struggle with maintaining semantic understanding, identity consistency, and editing capabilities in such scenarios. EditIDv2 addresses these issues by analyzing the impact of the ID integration module and exploring the influence of the ID feature integration module. By incorporating sophisticated techniques like PerceiverAttention decomposition, ID loss introduction, joint dynamic training with the diffusion model, and an offline fusion strategy for the integration module, EditIDv2 enables deep, multi-level semantic editing while preserving identity consistency with minimal data. This approach proves effective for generating high-quality images and performing well in the IBench evaluation. <div>

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench evaluation.

<div> Keywords: Scene Graph Anticipation, Commonsense knowledge, Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation, Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method, Large Language Model

Summary: <br><br>Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene graphs from video clips, but existing approaches struggle to integrate commonsense knowledge, affecting long-term prediction robustness. To address this, a new approach called Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA) is proposed, focusing on decoupling the SGA task into two steps. The Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) is introduced for LSGA, where a Large Language Model (LLM) predicts object appearances and disappearances before generating human-object relations. Extensive experiments show that OOTSM, in combination with STTran++, achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving short-term mean-Recall (@10) by 3.4% and long-term mean-Recall (@50) by 21.9%. The code for this approach is available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the field of scene graph anticipation. <div>

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves dramatically by 21.9%.

<div> physics-inspired priors, image denoising, neural architectures, convolutional neural network, high noise level
Summary:<br><br>In this paper, the authors explore the application of physics-inspired priors in improving image denoising algorithms. They introduce a hierarchy of pileup-inspired denoising models, including a residual CNN with conservation constraints, Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet). These models are tested on CIFAR-10 and BSD500 datasets with varying levels of Gaussian noise. The results show that physics-inspired priors enhance the robustness of denoising models, particularly at high noise levels. The key contributions of the study include translating pileup-mitigation principles into modular inductive biases, integrating them into UNet architecture, and demonstrating improved performance without relying on state-of-the-art techniques. <div>

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by "pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept: rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at $\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise. Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii) demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA machinery.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following (MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former, the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention. Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package, available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding, complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition, emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B) for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set), but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural language explanations for its predictions.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images. Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:<br>
This paper introduces enhancements to the LiDAR-BIND framework for sensor fusion, specifically focusing on enforcing temporal consistency. The proposed enhancements include a temporal embedding similarity mechanism to align consecutive latent spaces, a motion-aligned transformation loss to match displacement with ground truth LiDAR data, and a specialized temporal module for windowed temporal fusion. The updated model architecture also better preserves spatial structure. Evaluations show improved temporal and spatial coherence, with lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in SLAM applications. New metrics based on the Fréchet Video Motion Distance and correlation-peak distance provide indicators of temporal quality for SLAM performance assessment. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains the flexibility of modality fusion while significantly improving temporal stability, leading to enhanced robustness and performance for SLAM applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework, Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Summary: 
This research introduces a novel distance-adaptive super-resolution framework that addresses spatially-varying degradation models in real-world imaging systems. It formulates super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, utilizing pseudodifferential operators with distance-dependent spectral characteristics. The neural architecture incorporates depth-conditional convolution kernels and adaptive regularization terms based on scene geometry. By implementing spectral constraints from atmospheric scattering theory and adaptive kernel generation networks, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on depth-variant scenarios and traditional benchmarks. Evaluation on various datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality, with superior PSNR and SSIM scores compared to existing methods. This work represents a theoretically-grounded approach to super-resolution and showcases the importance of incorporating geometric scene understanding for optimal image reconstruction.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges. Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new dataset called InterAct, which focuses on capturing accurate interactive behaviors between two individuals in daily scenarios. Unlike previous works that often consider only one person or conversational gestures, InterAct simultaneously models the activities of two individuals engaged in objective-driven, dynamic interactions over longer durations. The dataset comprises 241 motion sequences where both individuals perform a realistic scenario with different roles and emotions, collaborating to complete a task or engage in interactive activities. The dataset captures diverse and complex movements, providing valuable insights into relatively long-term interaction patterns. The article also presents a diffusion-based method that estimates interactive facial expressions and body motions from speech inputs, regressing body motions hierarchically and fine-tuning facial expression accuracy. The dataset and code are made publicly available to facilitate further research. <br> <div>

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured. InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs. Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Summary:<br>
Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) is a challenging task that requires aligning text descriptions with dynamic visual content. Current methods struggle with complex descriptions and similar-looking objects. In response, the proposed PARSE-VOS framework utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for hierarchical reasoning across text and video domains. It parses natural language queries into structured commands and generates candidate trajectories guided by semantics. A hierarchical identification module performs coarse-to-fine reasoning, first using an LLM for motion reasoning and then triggering a pose verification stage if needed. PARSE-VOS achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS. <div>

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content, particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object. \textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Summary: 
Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs) is crucial for understanding early Chinese written language. A new dataset called PictOBI-20k has been created to evaluate the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) in visually deciphering OBCs. The dataset consists of 20k OBC and real object images, along with multi-choice questions. Experiments show that LMMs have some visual decipherment skills but are often limited by language priors. The dataset aims to improve visual attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset are available on GitHub for further research and development. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars, offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over 15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions, particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance. It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable in plug-and-play scenarios.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient, PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations, narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First, we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using 3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively, and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

<title>CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward Projection based View Transformation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05785</link>

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB (Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in 3D object detection.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection, yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy, efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act.

<title>A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations. The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference, enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement, outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tbwa233/Probabilistic-SAM/.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis. However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net, DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models (SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful clinical utility.

<title>BTCChat: Advancing Remote Sensing Bi-temporal Change Captioning with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

<title>A Fine-Grained Attention and Geometric Correspondence Model for Musculoskeletal Risk Classification in Athletes Using Multimodal Visual and Skeletal Features</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05913</link>

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations. ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of 93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of 93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of 0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions in sports.

<title>Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling, also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation. These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%. These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future. This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining high-quality realism.

arXiv:2509.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging. Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies, while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.

<title>OmniStyle2: Scalable and High Quality Artistic Style Transfer Data Generation via Destylization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05970</link>

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural, style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style transfer.

<title>ConstStyle: Robust Domain Generalization with Unified Style Transformation</title>

arXiv:2509.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains. To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

<title>Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting Distribution Correction</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one. Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene: pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

<title>Motion Aware ViT-based Framework for Monocular 6-DoF Spacecraft Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06000</link>

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers 6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning. Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels, each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine.

<title>BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06010</link>

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see. As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers, each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer, and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings. This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000 instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images). Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

<title>Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception</title>

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions. Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation. Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image. The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11% over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/CYF-cuber/FDP.

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of 100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications. While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the limited dataset size.

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects. Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets, while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment. However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090 GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1) Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), that employs cross-attention for skip connections, providing superior feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a viable path toward democratizing high-quality text-to-image generation for individual researchers and smaller organizations with limited computational resources.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&amp;G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our GitHub.

<title>SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122</link>

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity. Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

<title>UniVerse-1: Unified Audio-Video Generation via Stitching of Experts</title>

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

<title>UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset. Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions: improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model. Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system. The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while retaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.

<title>AI-driven Remote Facial Skin Hydration and TEWL Assessment from Selfie Images: A Systematic Solution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06282</link>

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function: skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly, diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens. However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression. Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

<title>Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291</link>

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

<title>Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However, relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks. To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical settings.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

<title>Multi View Slot Attention Using Paraphrased Texts For Face Anti-Spoofing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06336</link>

arXiv:2509.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens, failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text. MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset. The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management. Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification; however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters, restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet, HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in 177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12 months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations. Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

<title>3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes, though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as 3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden scene.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

<title>Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object Detection with Multimodal LLM</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06422</link>

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2) MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently, enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video. Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its strong generalization ability.

<title>When Language Model Guides Vision: Grounding DINO for Cattle Muzzle Detection</title>

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent, limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work, we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error (RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$, respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging, especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels, and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations. We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans, demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research. This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

<title>Does DINOv3 Set a New Medical Vision Standard?</title>

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization, such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.

<title>FSG-Net: Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

<title>WS$^2$: Weakly Supervised Segmentation using Before-After Supervision in Waste Sorting</title>

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable. Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials. To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt, including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

<title>TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KomJay520/TIDE.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks, volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al. (2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset. However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch. Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models, we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches. This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

<title>Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06570</link>

arXiv:2509.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology</title>

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators for color images.

<title>CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The application can be used in real time to click images and help identify potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g. in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

<title>Hybrid Swin Attention Networks for Simultaneously Low-Dose PET and CT Denoising</title>

arXiv:2509.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety. In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet), which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features, while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise. We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

<title>Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625</link>

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.

<title>Investigating Location-Regularised Self-Supervised Feature Learning for Seafloor Visual Imagery</title>

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration. Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL, with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs, high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL. Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$ and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

<title>Online Clustering of Seafloor Imagery for Interpretation during Long-Term AUV Operations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06678</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2509.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner. The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution, supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3% across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous marine exploration.

<title>VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level Guidance in Large Scenes</title>

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process, labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85% and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame, demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines, BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.

<title>STAGE: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis via Graded Diffusion with Explicit Mask Alignment</title>

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution, enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA) strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background, resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: We present Cortex Synth, a novel end-to-end differentiable framework for joint 3D skeleton geometry and topology synthesis from single 2D images. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical graph attention mechanism with multi-scale skeletal refinement, (2) Differentiable spectral topology optimization via Laplacian eigen decomposition, and (3) Adversarial geometric consistency training for pose structure alignment. The framework integrates four synergistic modules: a pseudo 3D point cloud generator, an enhanced PointNet encoder, a skeleton coordinate decoder, and a novel Differentiable Graph Construction Network (DGCN). Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results with 18.7 percent improvement in MPJPE and 27.3 percent in Graph Edit Distance on ShapeNet, while reducing topological errors by 42 percent compared to previous approaches. The model's end-to-end differentiability enables applications in robotic manipulation, medical imaging, and automated character rigging.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue, which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution, low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to $60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in complex natural environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study. Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we constructed a deep learning feature extraction network ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy, surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89% (890/900) on the expanded test set.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption, particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors (ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware, delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw, RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

<title>UrbanTwin: High-Fidelity Synthetic Replicas of Roadside Lidar Datasets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06781</link>

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly 3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released soon.

arXiv:2509.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1) CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2) learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However, since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity preserving.

arXiv:2509.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling, and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application, the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance across streaming platforms.

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow, single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

<title>Leveraging Generic Foundation Models for Multimodal Surgical Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition. As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47 different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery, they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images, increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring (ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50, II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed 3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227 validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model, ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits, reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

<title>Matching Shapes Under Different Topologies: A Topology-Adaptive Deformation Guided Approach</title>

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality.

<title>A New Hybrid Model of Generative Adversarial Network and You Only Look Once Algorithm for Automatic License-Plate Recognition</title>

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR) steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%, especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model, particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as input.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows, particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks, their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep, computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites, spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat and https://huggingface.co/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat.

<title>Interleaving Reasoning for Better Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

<title>H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers</title>

arXiv:2509.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID) performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights, features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

arXiv:2509.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design.

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies. Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with <0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization.

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes. Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching. State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details. The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue, the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing, assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND (Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5% Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN, UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96% specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets, reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient care in IoT healthcare environments.

<title>Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer, and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for data augmentation.

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints. Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and generalization capability.

<title>Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These images can then be classified based on their textural information using computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise, caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format. It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of 0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to operate on the proposed signal modality.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based, backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix, facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations, such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as encoded tags. Our primary contribution is a multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and their accurate and robust detection and classification.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data. As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: As AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, ascertaining whether an agent is human is critical. We systematically benchmark AI's ability to imitate humans in three language tasks (image captioning, word association, conversation) and three vision tasks (color estimation, object detection, attention prediction), collecting data from 636 humans and 37 AI agents. Next, we conducted 72,191 Turing-like tests with 1,916 human judges and 10 AI judges. Current AIs are approaching the ability to convincingly impersonate humans and deceive human judges in both language and vision. Even simple AI judges outperformed humans in distinguishing AI from human responses. Imitation ability showed minimal correlation with conventional AI performance metrics, suggesting that passing as human is an important independent evaluation criterion. The large-scale Turing datasets and metrics introduced here offer valuable benchmarks for assessing human-likeness in AI and highlight the importance of rigorous, quantitative imitation tests for AI development.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in image generation, capturing rich information about natural image statistics. This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model. We evaluate our approach on two leading publicly available diffusion models--Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion--and demonstrate that our method, termed Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction (ADIR), yields substantial improvements across a range of image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: The potential for deploying autonomous systems can be significantly increased by improving the perception and interpretation of the environment. However, the development of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems in unstructured outdoor environments poses challenges due to limited data availability for training and testing. To address this gap, we present the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for unstructured outdoor environments. The GOOSE dataset incorporates 10 000 labeled pairs of images and point clouds, which are utilized to train a range of state-of-the-art segmentation models on both image and point cloud data. We open source the dataset, along with an ontology for unstructured terrain, as well as dataset standards and guidelines. This initiative aims to establish a common framework, enabling the seamless inclusion of existing datasets and a fast way to enhance the perception capabilities of various robots operating in unstructured environments. The dataset, pre-trained models for offroad perception, and additional documentation can be found at https://goose-dataset.de/.

Abstract: This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that task-agnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6, respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14. Code and demo are available at https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/edgesam.

Abstract: We focus on species distribution modeling using global-scale presence-only data, leveraging geographical and environmental features to map species ranges, as in previous studies. However, we innovate by integrating taxonomic classification into our approach. Specifically, we propose using a large language model to extract a latent representation of the taxonomic classification from a textual prompt. This allows us to map the range of any taxonomic rank, including unseen species, without additional supervision. We also present a new proximity-aware evaluation metric, suitable for evaluating species distribution models, which addresses critical shortcomings of traditional metrics. We evaluated our model for species range prediction, zero-shot prediction, and geo-feature regression and found that it outperforms several state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding, falling short in achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Specifically, Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics. The source code, dataset and demo can be found at https://github.com/CircleRadon/Osprey.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate images based on prompt descriptions. While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.

Abstract: G-code (Geometric code) or RS-274 is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. G-code provides machine instructions for the movement of the 3D printer, especially for the nozzle, stage, and extrusion of material for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Currently, there does not exist a large repository of curated CAD models along with their corresponding G-code files for additive manufacturing. To address this issue, we present Slice-100K, a first-of-its-kind dataset of over 100,000 G-code files, along with their tessellated CAD model, LVIS (Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation) categories, geometric properties, and renderings. We build our dataset from triangulated meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by finetuning GPT-2 on a subset of the dataset for G-code translation from a legacy G-code format (Sailfish) to a more modern, widely used format (Marlin). Our dataset can be found at https://github.com/idealab-isu/Slice-100K. Slice-100K will be the first step in developing a multimodal foundation model for digital manufacturing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build ShapeSplat, a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet, ModelNet and Objaverse datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 206K objects spanning over 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 3.8 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.
  We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.

Abstract: Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.

Our approach employs course and input text constraints to generate course-relevant questions about specific diagram elements. We reveal three challenges of DDCQG: domain-specific knowledge requirements across courses, long-tail distribution in course coverage, and high information density in diagrams. To address these, we propose the Hierarchical Knowledge Integration framework (HKI-DDCQG), which utilizes trainable CLIP for identifying relevant diagram patches, leverages frozen vision-language models for knowledge extraction, and generates questions with trainable T5. Experiments demonstrate that HKI-DDCQG outperforms existing models on DiagramQG while maintaining strong generalizability across natural image datasets, establishing a strong baseline for DDCQG.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved outstanding results in the field of image super-resolution. These methods typically inject low-resolution (LR) images via ControlNet.In this paper, we first explore the temporal dynamics of information infusion through ControlNet, revealing that the input from LR images predominantly influences the initial stages of the denoising process. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel timestep-aware diffusion model that adaptively integrates features from both ControlNet and the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD). Our method enhances the transmission of LR information in the early stages of diffusion to guarantee image fidelity and stimulates the generation ability of the SD model itself more in the later stages to enhance the detail of generated images. To train this method, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy that adopts distinct losses at varying timesteps and acts on disparate modules. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code: https://github.com/SleepyLin/TASR

Abstract: We introduce a novel, data-driven approach for reconstructing temporally coherent 3D motion from unstructured and potentially partial observations of non-rigidly deforming shapes. Our goal is to achieve high-fidelity motion reconstructions for shapes that undergo near-isometric deformations, such as humans wearing loose clothing. The key novelty of our work lies in its ability to combine implicit shape representations with explicit mesh-based deformation models, enabling detailed and temporally coherent motion reconstructions without relying on parametric shape models or decoupling shape and motion. Each frame is represented as a neural field decoded from a feature space where observations over time are fused, hence preserving geometric details present in the input data. Temporal coherence is enforced with a near-isometric deformation constraint between adjacent frames that applies to the underlying surface in the neural field. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated by its application to human and animal motion sequences reconstructed from monocular depth videos.

<title>Motion-enhanced Cardiac Anatomy Segmentation via an Insertable Temporal Attention Module</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14929</link>

Abstract: Cardiac anatomy segmentation is useful for clinical assessment of cardiac morphology to inform diagnosis and intervention. Deep learning (DL), especially with motion information, has improved segmentation accuracy. However, existing techniques for motion enhancement are not yet optimal, and they have high computational costs due to increased dimensionality or reduced robustness due to suboptimal approaches that use non-DL motion registration, non-attention models, or single-headed attention. They further have limited adaptability and are inconvenient for incorporation into existing networks where motion awareness is desired. Here, we propose a novel, computationally efficient Temporal Attention Module (TAM) that offers robust motion enhancement, modeled as a small, multi-headed, cross-temporal attention module. TAM's uniqueness is that it is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be inserted into a broad range of segmentation networks (CNN-based, Transformer-based, or hybrid) for motion enhancement without requiring substantial changes in the network's backbone. This feature enables high adaptability and ease of integration for enhancing both existing and future networks. Extensive experiments on multiple 2D and 3D cardiac ultrasound and MRI datasets confirm that TAM consistently improves segmentation across a range of networks while maintaining computational efficiency and improving on currently reported performance. The evidence demonstrates that it is a robust, generalizable solution for motion-awareness enhancement that is scalable (such as from 2D to 3D).

<title>Separate Motion from Appearance: Customizing Motion via Customizing Text-to-Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Motion customization aims to adapt the diffusion model (DM) to generate videos with the motion specified by a set of video clips with the same motion concept. To realize this goal, the adaptation of DM should be possible to model the specified motion concept, without compromising the ability to generate diverse appearances. Thus, the key to solving this problem lies in how to separate the motion concept from the appearance in the adaptation process of DM. Typical previous works explore different ways to represent and insert a motion concept into large-scale pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, e.g., learning a motion LoRA, using latent noise residuals, etc. While those methods can encode the motion concept, they also inevitably encode the appearance in the reference videos, resulting in weakened appearance generation capability. In this paper, we follow the typical way to learn a motion LoRA to encode the motion concept, but propose two novel strategies to enhance motion-appearance separation, including temporal attention purification (TAP) and appearance highway (AH). Specifically, we assume that in the temporal attention module, the pretrained Value embeddings are sufficient to serve as basic components needed by producing a new motion. Thus, in TAP, we choose only to reshape the temporal attention with motion LoRAs so that Value embeddings can be reorganized to produce a new motion. Further, in AH, we alter the starting point of each skip connection in U-Net from the output of each temporal attention module to the output of each spatial attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to previous works, our method can generate videos with appearance more aligned with the text descriptions and motion more consistent with the reference videos.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely applied across various domains and industries. However, many fields still face challenges due to limited and insufficient data. This paper proposes a Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve (FAAGC) method in the pre-shape space to increase data. In the pre-shape space, objects with identical shapes lie on a great circle. Thus, we project deep model representations into the pre-shape space and construct a geodesic curve, i.e., an arc of a great circle, for each class. Feature augmentation is then performed by sampling along these geodesic paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAAGC improves classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and generalizes well across various feature types.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a key challenge in computer vision, requiring the matching of individuals across cameras, locations, and time. While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust systems that handle long-term variations caused by clothing and physical changes. We present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset designed for video-based long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA was recorded over seven months in four connected indoor environments using seven strategically placed cameras, capturing realistic movements with substantial clothing and appearance variability. The dataset includes 22 individuals, more than five hours of video, and about 1M bounding boxes with identity annotations obtained through semi-automatic labeling. We also define benchmark protocols for person tracking and Re-ID, covering diverse and challenging scenarios such as occlusion, reappearance, and multi-camera conditions. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios. The benchmark code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bdager/CHIRLA.

Abstract: Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, particularly in recognizing geographic information from images. However, VLMs still show regional biases in this task. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce a benchmark consisting of 1,200 images paired with detailed geographic metadata. Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from images, achieving up to 53.8% accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit significant biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less developed (-12.5%) and sparsely populated (-17.0%) areas. Moreover, regional biases of frequently over-predicting certain locations remain. For instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia, shown by the low entropy scores for these countries. The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for users who share images online without the intent of being identified. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/FairLocator.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. In this paper, we introduce In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy (In-Context RCA), a novel framework for automatically estimating segmentation quality in the absence of ground-truth annotations. By leveraging recent in-context learning segmentation models and incorporating retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images, our approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data. Validated across diverse medical imaging modalities, our method demonstrates robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

<title>GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.

Abstract: With the rise of real-world human-AI interaction applications, such as AI assistants, the need for Streaming Video Dialogue is critical. To address this need, we introduce StreamMind, a video LLM framework that achieves ultra-FPS streaming video processing (100 fps on a single A100) and enables proactive, always-on responses in real time, without explicit user intervention.
  To solve the key challenge of the contradiction between linear video streaming speed and quadratic transformer computation cost, we propose a novel perception-cognition interleaving paradigm named ''event-gated LLM invocation'', in contrast to the existing per-time-step LLM invocation. By introducing a Cognition Gate network between the video encoder and the LLM, LLM is only invoked when relevant events occur. To realize the event feature extraction with constant cost, we propose Event-Preserving Feature Extractor (EPFE) based on state-space method, generating a single perception token for spatiotemporal features. These techniques enable the video LLM with full-FPS perception and real-time cognition response.
  Experiments on Ego4D and SoccerNet streaming tasks, as well as standard offline benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both model capability and real-time efficiency, paving the way for ultra-high-FPS applications, such as Game AI and interactive media. The code and data is available at https://aka.ms/StreamMind.

Abstract: This research investigates both explicit and implicit social biases exhibited by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The key distinction between these bias types lies in the level of awareness: explicit bias refers to conscious, intentional biases, while implicit bias operates subconsciously. To analyze explicit bias, we directly pose questions to VLMs related to gender and racial differences: (1) Multiple-choice questions based on a given image (e.g., "What is the education level of the person in the image?") (2) Yes-No comparisons using two images (e.g., "Is the person in the first image more educated than the person in the second image?") For implicit bias, we design tasks where VLMs assist users but reveal biases through their responses: (1) Image description tasks: Models are asked to describe individuals in images, and we analyze disparities in textual cues across demographic groups. (2) Form completion tasks: Models draft a personal information collection form with 20 attributes, and we examine correlations among selected attributes for potential biases. We evaluate Gemini-1.5, GPT-4V, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.2-Vision and LLaVA-v1.6. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/VisBias.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning, particularly in facial translation networks, is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, paired, large-scale datasets. However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.

Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.

Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. The U-Net is compared with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis, yet it faces three major challenges: insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, disruption of contextual continuity, and noise interference. This study proposes a dual-stage solution to address these issues. The first stage employs a Reversible Multi-Scale Fusion Module (RMS) that uses hierarchical adaptive convolution to dynamically merge cross-scale features from capillaries to main vessels, self-adaptively calibrating feature biases. The second stage introduces a Vascular-Oriented Attention Mechanism, which models long-distance vascular continuity through an axial pathway and enhances the capture of topological key nodes, such as bifurcation points, via a dedicated bifurcation attention pathway. The synergistic operation of these two pathways effectively restores the continuity of vascular structures and improves the segmentation accuracy of complex vascular networks. Systematic experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1 datasets demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9909, sensitivity of 0.9198, and specificity of 0.9953, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances temporal structure learning by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video frames and moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Backgrounds in images play a major role in contributing to spurious correlations among different data points. Owing to aesthetic preferences of humans capturing the images, datasets can exhibit positional (location of the object within a given frame) and size (region-of-interest to image ratio) biases for different classes. In this paper, we show that these biases can impact how much a model relies on spurious features in the background to make its predictions. To better illustrate our findings, we propose a synthetic dataset derived from ImageNet-1k, Hard-Spurious-ImageNet, which contains images with various backgrounds, object positions, and object sizes. By evaluating the dataset on different pretrained models, we find that most models rely heavily on spurious features in the background when the region-of-interest (ROI) to image ratio is small and the object is far from the center of the image. Moreover, we also show that current methods that aim to mitigate harmful spurious features, do not take into account these factors, hence fail to achieve considerable performance gains for worst-group accuracies when the size and location of core features in an image change. The dataset and implementation code are available at https://github.com/Mishalfatima/Corner_Cases.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility.
  Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.

<title>Making Rotation Averaging Fast and Robust with Anisotropic Coordinate Descent</title>

Abstract: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation, uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page: https://ylochman.github.io/acd

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with computer vision is profoundly transforming perception tasks like image segmentation. For intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where accurate scene understanding is critical for safety and efficiency, this new paradigm offers unprecedented capabilities. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of LLM-augmented image segmentation, focusing on its applications, challenges, and future directions within ITS. We provide a taxonomy of current approaches based on their prompting mechanisms and core architectures, and we highlight how these innovations can enhance road scene understanding for autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance. Finally, we identify key challenges, including real-time performance and safety-critical reliability, and outline a perspective centered on explainable, human-centric AI as a prerequisite for the successful deployment of this technology in next-generation transportation systems.

<title>Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Efficient Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to effectively capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.

<title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the binding problem: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces VISER (Visual Input Structure for Enhanced Reasoning), a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISER improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. VISER enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years, yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness, generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically, CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

<title>Leveraging Out-of-Distribution Unlabeled Images: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with an Open-Vocabulary Model</title>

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4Edit.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications -- colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream, respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00% key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed multimodal search strategy.

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization. While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space, generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2) Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by them.

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of entropy change in deep learning systems by noise injection at different levels, including the embedding space and the image. The series of models that employ our methodology are collectively known as Noisy Neural Networks (NoisyNN), with examples such as NoisyViT and NoisyCNN. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this work shows noise can be an effective way to change the entropy of the learning system. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep models under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the task complexity. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of 95$\%$ on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise, can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.

Abstract: Mis- and disinformation online have become a major societal problem as major sources of online harms of different kinds. One common form of mis- and disinformation is out-of-context (OOC) information, where different pieces of information are falsely associated, e.g., a real image combined with a false textual caption or a misleading textual description. Although some past studies have attempted to defend against OOC mis- and disinformation through external evidence, they tend to disregard the role of different pieces of evidence with different stances. Motivated by the intuition that the stance of evidence represents a bias towards different detection results, we propose a stance extraction network (SEN) that can extract the stances of different pieces of multi-modal evidence in a unified framework. Moreover, we introduce a support-refutation score calculated based on the co-occurrence relations of named entities into the textual SEN. Extensive experiments on a public large-scale dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, with the best model achieving a performance gain of 3.2% in accuracy. The source code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/yx3266/SEN.

Abstract: While deep learning holds great promise for disease diagnosis and prognosis in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, its progress is often constrained by highly imbalanced and biased training datasets. To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Objectives: To present a publicly available deep learning-based torso segmentation model that provides comprehensive voxel-wise coverage, including delineations that extend to the boundaries of anatomical compartments. Materials and Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition models for Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MR) images, then improved them iteratively and retrained an nnUNet model. Using a random retrospective subset of German National Cohort (NAKO), UK Biobank, internal MR and Computed Tomography (CT) data (Training: 2897 series from 626 subjects, 290 female; mean age 53+-16; 3-fold-cross validation (20% hold-out). Internal testing 36 series from 12 subjects, 6 male; mean age 60+-11), we segmented 71 structures in torso MR and 72 in CT images: 20 organs, 10 muscles, 19 vessels, 16 bones, ribs in CT, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal and body composition (subcutaneous fat, unclassified muscles and visceral fat). For external validation, we used existing automatic organ segmentations, independent ground truth segmentations on gradient echo images, and the Amos data. We used non-parametric bootstrapping for confidence intervals and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for computing statistical significance. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.90+-0.06 on our internal gradient echo test set, which included 71 semantic segmentation labels. Our model ties with the best model on Amos with a Dice of 0,81+-0.14, while having a larger field of view and a considerably higher number structures included. Conclusion: Our work presents a publicly available full-torso segmentation model for MRI and CT images that classifies almost all subject voxels to date.

Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm preserving stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets degrades system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), a model architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention to combat heterogeneous data in FL. ANFR leverages weight standardization to avoid mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, ensuring robustness under heterogeneity, and channel attention to produce learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing inconsistencies across clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by improving class selectivity and channel attention weight distribution. ANFR works with any aggregation method, supports both global and personalized FL, and adds minimal overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. Extensive experiments show ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions. Code is provided at https://github.com/siomvas/ANFR.

Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.

However, the simulation-to-reality, or Sim2Real distribution shift -- introduced by employing simulation-trained policies in real-world environments -- frequently prevents successful policy transfer. We present an offline framework to evaluate the performance of using large-scale pre-trained vision encoders to address the Sim2Real gap. We examine a diverse collection of encoders, assessing their ability to extract features necessary for robot control (Action Score) while remaining invariant to task-irrelevant environmental variations (Domain Invariance Score). Evaluating 23 encoders, we reveal patterns across architectures, pre-training datasets, and parameter scales. Our findings show that manipulation-pretrained encoders consistently achieve higher Action Scores, CNN-based encoders demonstrate stronger domain invariance than ViTs, and the best-performing models combine both properties, underscoring DIS and AS as complementary predictors of Sim2Real transferability.

<title>Efficient Alignment of Unconditioned Action Prior for Language-conditioned Pick and Place in Clutter</title>

Abstract: We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.

<title>Multimodal Latent Fusion of ECG Leads for Early Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in early assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily focus on applying machine learning methods to centralized diagnostic modalities, such as 12-lead electrocardiogram (12L-ECG). Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/Shef-AIRE/LS-EMVAE.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Semi-SD, a novel metric depth estimation framework tailored for surrounding cameras equipment in autonomous driving. In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality. The source code will be available on https://github.com/xieyuser/Semi-SD.

arXiv:2503.19757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning. Project Page: https://robodita.github.io.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks. However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings while broadening Mamba's applicability.

Abstract: Content generation modeling has emerged as a promising direction in computational pathology, offering capabilities such as data-efficient learning, synthetic data augmentation, and task-oriented generation across diverse diagnostic tasks. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy, they depend on high-quality labeled images, making them unsuitable for segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.

<title>SUDER: Self-Improving Unified Large Multimodal Models for Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-Rewards</title>

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate vision-language alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are naturally inverse dual tasks, we propose \textbf{SUDER} (\textbf{S}elf-improving \textbf{U}nified LMMs with \textbf{D}ual s\textbf{E}lf-\textbf{R}ewards), a framework reinforcing the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs with a self-supervised dual reward mechanism. SUDER leverages the inherent duality between understanding and generation tasks to provide self-supervised optimization signals for each other. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood within the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic CT projection data is crucial for advancing imaging research, yet its generation remains challenging. Current image domain methods are limited as they cannot simulate the physical acquisition process or utilize the complete statistical information present in projection data, restricting their utility and fidelity. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain. Unlike previous approaches that operate in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representations from projection data and leverages anatomical text prompts for controllable synthesis. Projection data generation models can utilize complete measurement signals and simulate the physical processes of scanning, including material attenuation characteristics, beam hardening, scattering, and projection geometry, and support research on downstream imaging tasks. Moreover, PRO functions as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves performance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PRO.

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

Abstract: Knowledge discovery and collection are intelligence-intensive tasks that traditionally require significant human effort to ensure high-quality outputs. Recent research has explored multi-agent frameworks for automating Wikipedia-style article generation by retrieving and synthesizing information from the internet. However, these methods primarily focus on text-only generation, overlooking the importance of multimodal content in enhancing informativeness and engagement. In this work, we introduce WikiAutoGen, a novel system for automated multimodal Wikipedia-style article generation. Unlike prior approaches, WikiAutoGen retrieves and integrates relevant images alongside text, enriching both the depth and visual appeal of generated content. To further improve factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective self-reflection mechanism, which critically assesses retrieved content from diverse viewpoints to enhance reliability, breadth, and coherence, etc. Additionally, we introduce WikiSeek, a benchmark comprising Wikipedia articles with topics paired with both textual and image-based representations, designed to evaluate multimodal knowledge generation on more challenging topics. Experimental results show that WikiAutoGen outperforms previous methods by 8%-29% on our WikiSeek benchmark, producing more accurate, coherent, and visually enriched Wikipedia-style articles.

<div> perceived risk, automated vehicles, trust, driving simulator, facial expression

Summary:
The study investigated perceived risk in automated vehicles by conducting an experiment with 32 participants using a driving simulator. Different driving styles were tested, and the introduction of a crossing pedestrian was also examined. Results showed that discomfort was associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking, with the dynamic driving style inducing stronger discomfort. Facial expression analysis revealed that most participants did not show detectable reactions to critical events, indicating that it may not be a reliable method for assessing perceived risk. A neural network model using vehicle motion and skin conductance was implemented to predict perceived risk, showing promising results in correlating with reported discomfort. This suggests the potential for objective perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and pointing towards future research directions.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants, consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception. Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most (15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event. Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4 showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and highlighting areas for future research.

Summary:
PromptEnhancer introduces a novel prompt rewriting framework to enhance text-to-image models by improving attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships in generated images. The framework, which includes a Chain-of-Thought rewriter trained through reinforcement learning guided by an AlignEvaluator, helps address the mismatch between user prompts and model outputs. By optimizing the CoT rewriter based on a taxonomy of 24 key points derived from T2I failure modes, PromptEnhancer improves image-text alignment in the HunyuanImage 2.1 model. The AlignEvaluator provides explicit feedback to enhance prompt generation, resulting in more precise interpretations by T2I models. Additionally, a human preference benchmark is introduced to support further research in this area.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

<div> Keywords: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, multimodal models, image generation, editing capabilities, reinforcement strategy

Summary:
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext is a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, achieving state-of-the-art image generation and editing in a unified multimodal framework.

<br /><br />Summary: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext excels in image generation and editing within a multimodal framework, leveraging a novel reinforcement strategy and achieving top-tier performance through joint training and integration of tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.

Summary:
Inpaint4Drag introduces a novel framework for drag-based image editing, combining bidirectional warping and image inpainting to achieve precise control and real-time performance. Inspired by elastic object deformation, the method treats image regions as deformable materials, maintaining natural shape under user manipulation. The approach enables real-time warping previews and efficient inpainting at high resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared to existing methods. By transforming drag inputs into standard inpainting formats, Inpaint4Drag can adapt to any inpainting model without architecture modifications, benefiting from future improvements in inpainting technology. Extensive experiments showcase superior visual quality and precise control, making Inpaint4Drag a versatile and efficient tool for intuitive image manipulation. <div>

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at 512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification, automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/inpaint4drag/

<div> Defense, Object Detection, Adversarial Patch Attacks, DISPATCH, Generative Models<br />
Summary:<br />
- Object detection is crucial for applications like security monitoring, but current detectors are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks.
- DISPATCH is a novel defense framework that uses diffusion models to regenerate and rectify images, disarming attack effects and preserving image integrity.
- Unlike other methods, DISPATCH does not require prior knowledge of existing patches and is attack-agnostic.
- Experiments show DISPATCH outperforms existing defenses, achieving high mAP.5 scores on hiding and creating attacks.
- DISPATCH also exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective, generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection. Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches, DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data. A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware framework for dense video captioning that addresses limitations in existing end-to-end models. It introduces Saliency-aware Video Reweighting to convert timestamp annotations into frame importance weights based on saliency, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval to segment videos by frame similarity, capturing scene transitions. By improving video weighting and retrieval simultaneously, Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets. This approach demonstrates the benefits of considering both timestamp annotations and scene transitions in dense video captioning tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models, they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of 90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics. Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation smart cities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs) have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

arXiv:2509.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the diverse vehicle platforms.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.

<div> Keywords: versatile medical image segmentation, partially labeled datasets, task consistency training, class imbalance, uncertainty-weighted loss<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework for versatile medical image segmentation on partially labeled datasets. TCT aims to address class imbalance without the need for extra models by enforcing consistency between main segmentation and auxiliary task predictions. This allows for effective utilization of unlabeled anatomical structures while minimizing error propagation from low-consistency data through a filtering strategy. Additionally, a unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) is proposed to prevent segmentation quality declines due to task dominance. The approach is validated through extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy and addressing class imbalance issues in versatile medical image segmentation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging, where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases, we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets. Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition, realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

<div> Keywords: MCANet, multi-scale representation, spatial attention, post-hurricane damage assessment, image classification

Summary:
MCANet is proposed as a multi-label classification framework for post-hurricane damage assessment. It utilizes a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to capture multi-scale spatial features and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module for enhanced discrimination.

The model's ability to localize damage-relevant regions is confirmed through class activation mapping, providing interpretability. The outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping, emergency routing, and disaster response. Future work may involve integrating disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language models to enhance adaptability to unseen disasters and improve semantic understanding for decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: MCANet, a multi-label classification framework, effectively assesses post-hurricane damage by capturing multi-scale spatial features and enhancing discrimination through attention mechanisms. Its superior performance, interpretability, and potential applications make it a valuable tool for disaster response and recovery efforts. Future enhancements could further improve adaptability and semantic understanding for comprehensive decision-making in disaster scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category. MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael. MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads, performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping, emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic understanding for real-world decision-making.

<div> Vision-Language Model, group detection, dynamic human group, video, global optimization
Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic human group detection in videos, considering both local appearance features of individuals within the group and the global scene context. This method utilizes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract local and global appearance features in each frame. Unlike previous methods that assume group structures remain static, this approach accounts for dynamically changing groups through global optimization using a graph and groupness probabilities estimated by groupness-augmented CLIP features. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing group detection techniques on public datasets. The code for this method is available on GitHub for reference and further exploration. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code: https://github.com/irajisamurai/VLM-GroupDetection.git

FloodVision is introduced as a framework for accurate floodwater depth estimation, crucial for emergency response. It combines the GPT-4o vision-language model with a domain knowledge graph encoding real-world object dimensions. It dynamically identifies visible reference objects, retrieves heights from the knowledge graph, estimates submergence ratios, and filters outliers to compute depth values. Evaluated on MyCoast New York images, it achieves an 8.17 cm mean absolute error, outperforming CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across various scenes, operates in near real-time, and is suitable for integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.

<br />
Summary: 
The study introduces a novel Hybrid-Tower framework for Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) that combines the strengths of Two-Tower and Single-Tower frameworks. The proposed method, PIG, employs Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation to generate pseudo-queries for videos, facilitating effective interaction between video and textual features. This approach improves retrieval performance by 1.6% to 3.9% in R@1 across five benchmark datasets. PIG achieves high efficiency by introducing no extra overhead during inference, maintaining a performance level comparable to Two-Tower models. The Hybrid-Tower framework shows promise in balancing effectiveness and efficiency in text-to-video retrieval tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG, which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim 3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Summary: <br />
Accurate image registration is crucial for lunar exploration, allowing for surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. The study evaluates five feature matching algorithms, including SuperGlue, for aligning data from different lunar sensors. A proposed preprocessing pipeline involves georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and image enhancements to improve registration accuracy. SuperGlue consistently outperforms other algorithms in terms of both accuracy and speed. Classical methods like SIFT and AKAZE perform well in equatorial regions but struggle in polar lighting conditions. The findings emphasize the significance of preprocessing techniques and deep learning-based approaches in achieving robust lunar image registration across varying environmental conditions. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera, Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer), and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting. The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures, demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer, achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models, a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input. Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach for optimizing light field image super-resolution (LFSR) using Mamba-based methods. The proposed Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy improves feature extraction efficiency by reducing redundancy in complex LF data. A dual-stage modeling strategy enhances the exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations by incorporating spatial-angular and disparity information extraction in different stages. The Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) and Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) combined with the Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) facilitate shallow and deep feature extraction for spatial-angular and epipolar domains. The resulting hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, LFMT, outperforms existing LFSR methods by achieving significant performance improvements with low computational complexity on various LF datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution (LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations. Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word and synthetic LF datasets.

Summary: 
PropVG is introduced as an end-to-end proposal-based framework that integrates foreground object proposal generation with referential object comprehension. It incorporates a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module that utilizes contrastive learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the understanding and differentiation of referred objects. A Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module is designed to fuse object- and semantic-level information for improved recognition of absent targets. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of PropVG in visual grounding tasks. The framework addresses limitations of existing methods by considering both referred and prospective targets for supervision, as well as incorporating multi-granularity discrimination techniques. The codes and models of PropVG are publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms. However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision, overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover, existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination, which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets. Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO (REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG.

arXiv:2509.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Summary:
OmniFHT is a new framework introduced for high-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging in flow cytometry, enabling label-free characterization of individual cells as they flow through microfluidic channels. Unlike current methods that assume uniform single-axis rotation of cells, OmniFHT allows for arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations by jointly optimizing rotational trajectory and volumetric structure. This framework leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations to accurately reconstruct cell populations without the need for known poses at each frame. OmniFHT supports reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, providing high-fidelity results with minimal viewing angles. This advancement enables in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of flowing cell populations, allowing for scalable and unbiased morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging. By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.

<div> Keywords: Mobile reconstruction, autonomous aerial robotics, Gaussian Splatting, semantic editing, novel view synthesis

Summary:<br /><br />Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics is crucial for applications like disaster response. The focus is on points of interest (PoIs) rather than full scene optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) combined with semantic editing provides high-quality 3D reconstruction. The proposed CoRe-GS approach generates a coarse segmentation-ready scene using semantic GS, followed by color-based effective filtering for object isolation. This reduces training time by about a quarter compared to full training cycles for semantic GS. Evaluation on SCRREAM and NeRDS 360 datasets shows reduced runtime and improved novel view synthesis quality. <div>
arXiv:2509.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing. To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world, outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher novel-view-synthesis quality.

<div> Keywords: Cryoablation, Prostate cancer, Reinforcement learning, Markov decision process, Optimal policy <br /> 
<br />
Summary: 
Cryoablation is a minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer that aims to destroy cancerous tissue while sparing healthy structures. Current manual planning methods for cryoprobe placements can be time-consuming and variable in quality. In response to these challenges, Cryo-RL introduces a reinforcement learning framework to automate the planning process. By modeling cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process, the agent learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement based on tumour coverage. Through simulated environments reflecting clinical constraints, the agent achieved significant improvements in treatment planning compared to automated baselines. This approach demonstrates the potential for reinforcement learning to deliver efficient, reproducible, and clinically viable cryoablation plans with enhanced precision and reduced planning time. <div>

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Advances in computer vision have paved the way for clinical applications like computerized exposure therapy. In this study, pretrained computer vision models were utilized to predict fear levels from spider-related images. The models, adapted using transfer learning, demonstrated an average mean absolute error between 10.1 and 11.0 when predicting human fear ratings. It was found that reducing the dataset size significantly impacted model performance, with no substantial gains observed with further increases. Explainability assessments confirmed that the models' predictions were based on spider-related features. A category-wise error analysis highlighted specific visual conditions, such as distant views and artificial/painted spiders, associated with higher errors. These results underscore the potential of explainable computer vision models in predicting fear ratings and stress the significance of model explainability and sufficient dataset size for the development of effective emotion-aware therapeutic technologies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance, though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision (CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry. However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios. Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear and tear detection scenarios

<div> Keywords: sebocytes, lipid droplets, image analysis, multiple instance learning, attention mechanism

Summary: 
Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells with intracellular lipid droplets, making quantification important. Manual counting is tedious, leading to the development of automated solutions. A new attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for analyzing sebocyte images was introduced. Nile Red-stained images were annotated into 14 classes based on droplet counts. Data augmentation expanded the dataset to around 50,000 cells. Two models were compared: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and an attention-based MIL model utilizing ResNet-50 features. The baseline MLP showed more stable performance with a mean MAE of 5.6, while the attention-based MIL had a mean MAE of 10.7 but outperformed in specific folds. The study suggests that bag-level aggregation provides a reliable baseline for droplet counting at the slide level, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to reach its full potential in sebocyte image analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Summary: 
UniView proposes a novel approach to the task of synthesizing novel views from a single image by leveraging reference images from a similar object. The model uses a retrieval and augmentation system along with a multimodal large language model to select suitable reference images. A plug-and-play adapter module with multi-level isolation layers dynamically generates reference features for target views. A decoupled triple attention mechanism is designed to align and integrate multi-branch features for preserving original input image details. Extensive experiments show that UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming, requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger scale.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces a new framework, GD^2Fusion, for infrared-visible image fusion in dual-source degraded scenarios.
- It combines vision-language models for degradation perception with dual-domain optimization.
- The Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction module suppresses frequency-domain degradation and extracts relevant features.
- The Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion module filters cross-modal degradation and aggregates multi-source features for enhanced fusion.
- Extensive experiments show that GD^2Fusion outperforms existing methods in dual-source degraded scenarios. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion), a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features. Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA, and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM, KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing, interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

<div> Keywords: object perception, low-light traffic scenes, Dark-traffic dataset, Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), benchmark 

Summary:
Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes is crucial but challenging due to illumination degradation. To address this, a novel illumination degradation method and the Dark-traffic dataset are introduced. A biologically inspired Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM) is proposed, incorporating innovative features such as light-adaptive pupillary mechanism, separable learning strategy, task-specific branches, and spatial misalignment-aware fusion module. SLVM achieves superior performance over existing models, outperforming RT-DETR in detection, YOLOv12 in instance segmentation, and enhancing endpoint error metrics on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, SLVM outperforms Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN, and surpasses Mask RCNN (with light enhancement). The Dark-traffic dataset and SLVM code are available for further research and development at the provided GitHub repository. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1 percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at https://github.com/alanli1997/slvm.

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD, HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and generalizability.

Summary:
The article introduces LUIVITON, an automated system for virtual try-on that can drape complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse humanoid characters in various poses. The system uses SMPL as a proxy representation and addresses the clothing-to-body draping problem through two correspondence tasks: clothing-to-SMPL and body-to-SMPL. The clothing-to-SMPL fitting is achieved through a geometric learning approach for shape correspondence prediction, while body-to-SMPL correspondence is addressed using a diffusion model-based approach with multi-view consistent appearance features. LUIVITON can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and a wide range of characters efficiently. The system allows for fast customization of clothing size and material properties post-draping. It can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings automatically, even without 2D clothing sewing patterns. <div>

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on, capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence, where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots, cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size, allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not available.

Summary: <br />
Industrial product inspection often uses Anomaly Detection frameworks trained on non-defective samples. However, incorporating defective samples for training requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this issue, ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation algorithm, allows users to generate pixel-wise anomaly annotations with only a few clicks and a brief description. This precise labeling significantly improves AD model performance. Additionally, ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework integrating visual features and textual prompts, achieves state-of-the-art results on Multi-class anomaly detection tasks by combining pixel-level priors and language-guided cues. Overall, these approaches enhance anomaly detection accuracy and efficiency in industrial settings. <br />

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD) frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models, show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed, including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient care outcomes.

<div> framework, Gaussian splatting, geometric priors, optimization, novel view synthesis

Summary:
GeoSplat is a new framework introduced in this study that utilizes both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to enhance the optimization process of Gaussian splatting. By incorporating geometric priors, such as principal curvatures, in the initialization of 3D Gaussian primitives, GeoSplat improves surface coverage compared to random initialization. The framework also introduces noise-robust estimation methods for dynamic geometric priors based on specific geometric structures like local manifolds. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis demonstrate that GeoSplat significantly enhances the performance of Gaussian splatting and surpasses previous methods. <div>

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

<div> Keywords: Facial Beauty Prediction, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, Multi-scale representations, State-of-the-art performance

Summary: 
The article introduces the Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT) architecture for Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP), combining CNNs and Transformers to capture facial characteristics at different scales and model their interactions. The SIT model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset with a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187. The success of SIT demonstrates the importance of explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale visual cues for high-performance FBP. The hybrid CNN-Transformer approach shows promise for complex image regression tasks requiring a holistic understanding of context. <div>

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale, potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware understanding.

<div> Keywords: sparse mixture-of-experts, convolutional neural networks, robustness, adversarial attacks, ResNet architectures 

Summary: 
Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers are explored to enhance the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks. By replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with MoE layers in deeper stages of ResNet architectures trained on CIFAR-100, improved robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks is achieved through adversarial training. However, the use of switch loss for balancing leads to routing collapse onto a few overused experts, concentrating adversarial training on specific paths and inadvertently making them more robust. This concentration results in some individual experts surpassing the gated MoE model in robustness, indicating the emergence of robust subpaths through specialization. This study highlights the potential of sparse MoE layers in enhancing the robustness of CNNs against adversarial attacks. Code for the study is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

arXiv:2509.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust. As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization.

<div> framework, Contradistinguisher, source-free, semi-supervised, regression <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces CRAFT, a new framework for source-free, semi-supervised transfer learning in regression tasks. It addresses the challenge of domain adaptation in real-world applications where source data cannot be shared and labeled target data is limited. CRAFT builds upon the Contradistinguisher framework, originally designed for unsupervised DA in classification tasks, and extends it to regression tasks. The efficacy of CRAFT is demonstrated in neuroscience settings, specifically gaze prediction with EEG data and brain age prediction with MRI data, showing up to a 9% improvement in RMSE over fine-tuned models when labeled data is scarce. CRAFT outperforms four state-of-the-art source-free DA models by more than 3% and is shown to be effective in other real-world regression benchmarks. The proposed approach offers a flexible and efficient solution for semi-supervised deep transfer learning in biology and medicine. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine) face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs. Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets. We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet, CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF), semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Summary:
A new transformer-based framework is proposed for generating high-quality textures in 3D content creation. Unlike existing methods, this framework predicts a 3D texture field directly from a single image and mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping. The method integrates a triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses for efficient training and faster texture generation, enabling high-fidelity textures to be generated in just 0.2s per shape. Extensive evaluations show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fidelity to the input image and perceptual quality, making it practical for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

<div> instance segmentation, 3D vision, semantic mask, geometric refinement, training-free

Summary:<br />
accurate 3D instance segmentation is essential in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle due to errors in the lifting process. A novel framework, SGS-3D, purifies and splits lifted masks using geometric primitives, then grows them into complete instances. SGS-3D refines without training by fusing semantic and geometric information, improving segmentation accuracy. It filters ambiguous masks using geometric co-occurrence and constructs fine-grained instances with spatial continuity and high-level features. Experimental results on various datasets show improved accuracy and robustness. The approach yields high-fidelity object instances and generalizes well across different indoor and outdoor environments. The code is available for further exploration. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks, thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features, particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects. Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Summary:
This paper discusses the challenges in sign language recognition (SLR) due to the scarcity of annotated data. It proposes a self-supervised learning framework to address these challenges. The framework includes a new self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs and a new data augmentation technique. By considering the relevance of certain parts of a sign video and addressing the issue of shared movements between different signs, the proposed approach aims to learn more meaningful representations for SLR. The framework shows significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing contrastive and self-supervised methods across various evaluation tasks, including linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages. This work provides a promising direction for improving sign recognition through self-supervised learning techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably, Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models.

Summary: 
The study explores the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) for scalable vector graphics (SVGs) based on natural-language descriptions. A benchmark, SGP-GenBench, is introduced to evaluate object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality. It is found that proprietary models outperform open-source models, with performance linked to coding abilities. An reinforcement learning approach with verifiable rewards is proposed to enhance the generation of SVGs, resulting in improved quality and semantics comparable to state-of-the-art systems. Analysis of training dynamics shows finer decomposition of objects and contextual details that enhance scene coherence. The study demonstrates that symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable means for cross-modal grounding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

COGITAO is a new data generation framework and benchmark designed to study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Inspired by ARC-AGI's problem-setting, it creates rule-based tasks by applying transformations to objects in grid environments.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28 interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to support continued research in this field.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window, thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive experiments on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.

Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks. Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23 representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points. However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning optimization.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary, underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.

<title>Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression</title>

arXiv:2509.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.

<title>Multi-modal Uncertainty Robust Tree Cover Segmentation For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment. Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism, producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives. Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks. Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer routes.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the model's predictions across candidate object locations.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world, causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared to other models. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/PRIM.

Abstract: Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased, heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views. Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism, which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally, inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene. Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

Abstract: 3D skeleton-based human action recognition has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional RGB and depth-based approaches, offering robustness to environmental variations, computational efficiency, and enhanced privacy. Despite remarkable progress, current research remains fragmented across diverse input representations and lacks evaluation under scenarios that reflect modern real-world challenges.
  This paper presents a representation-centric survey of skeleton-based action recognition, systematically categorizing state-of-the-art methods by their input feature types: joint coordinates, bone vectors, motion flows, and extended representations, and analyzing how these choices influence spatial-temporal modeling strategies.
  Building on the insights from this review, we introduce ANUBIS, a large-scale, challenging skeleton action dataset designed to address critical gaps in existing benchmarks. ANUBIS incorporates multi-view recordings with back-view perspectives, complex multi-person interactions, fine-grained and violent actions, and contemporary social behaviors.
  We benchmark a diverse set of state-of-the-art models on ANUBIS and conduct an in-depth analysis of how different feature types affect recognition performance across 102 action categories. Our results show strong action-feature dependencies, highlight the limitations of na\"ive multi-representational fusion, and point toward the need for task-aware, semantically aligned integration strategies. This work offers both a comprehensive foundation and a practical benchmarking resource, aiming to guide the next generation of robust, generalizable skeleton-based action recognition systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the constraints on model performance imposed by the size of the training data, data augmentation has become an essential technique in deep learning. However, most existing data augmentation methods are affected by information loss and perform poorly in small-sample scenarios, which limits their application. To overcome the limitation, we propose a Feature Augmentation method on Geodesic Curve in the pre-shape space, called the FAGC. First, a pre-trained neural network model is employed to extract features from the input images. Then, the image features as a vector is projected into the pre-shape space by removing its position and scale information. In the pre-shape space, an optimal Geodesic curve is constructed to fit the feature vectors. Finally, new feature vectors are generated for model learning by interpolating along the constructed Geodesic curve. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the FAGC. The results demonstrate that applying the FAGC to deep learning or machine learning methods can significantly improve their performance in small-sample tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating visual and textual inputs, yet modality alignment remains one of the most challenging aspects. Current MLLMs typically rely on simple adapter architectures and pretraining approaches to bridge vision encoders with large language models (LLM), guided by image-level supervision. We identify this paradigm often leads to suboptimal alignment between modalities, significantly constraining the LLM's ability to properly interpret and reason with visual features particularly for smaller language models. This limitation degrades overall performance-particularly for smaller language models where capacity constraints are more pronounced and adaptation capabilities are limited. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level supervision alignment method that enables more precise visual-text alignment during pretraining. SEA introduces minimal computational overhead while preserving language capabilities and substantially improving cross-modal understanding. Our comprehensive analyses reveal critical insights into the adapter's role in multimodal integration, and extensive experiments demonstrate that SEA consistently improves performance across various model sizes, with smaller models benefiting the most (average performance gain of 7.61% for Gemma-2B). This work establishes a foundation for developing more effective alignment strategies for future multimodal systems.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new Kalman filter with probabilistic data association between measurements and states. We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hwcao17/pkf.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to generate diverse and high-quality images for an unseen class given only a few examples in that class. A key challenge in this task is balancing category consistency and image diversity, which often compete with each other. Moreover, existing methods offer limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying stochastic subcodes or semantic codes. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a better balance between preserving category-relevant features and promoting image diversity with limited data. Furthermore, HypDAE offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DirectorLLM, a novel video generation model that employs a large language model (LLM) to orchestrate human poses within videos. As foundational text-to-video models rapidly evolve, the demand for high-quality human motion and interaction grows. To address this need and enhance the authenticity of human motions, we extend the LLM from a text generator to a video director and human motion simulator. Utilizing open-source resources from Llama 3, we train the DirectorLLM to generate detailed instructional signals, such as human poses, to guide video generation. This approach offloads the simulation of human motion from the video generator to the LLM, effectively creating informative outlines for human-centric scenes. These signals are used as conditions by the video renderer, facilitating more realistic and prompt-following video generation. As an independent LLM module, it can be applied to different video renderers, including UNet and DiT, with minimal effort. Experiments on automatic evaluation benchmarks and human evaluations show that our model outperforms existing ones in generating videos with higher human motion fidelity, improved prompt faithfulness, and enhanced rendered subject naturalness.

Abstract: With the rapid growth usage of face recognition in people's daily life, face anti-spoofing becomes increasingly important to avoid malicious attacks. Recent face anti-spoofing models can reach a high classification accuracy on multiple datasets but these models can only tell people "this face is fake" while lacking the explanation to answer "why it is fake". Such a system undermines trustworthiness and causes user confusion, as it denies their requests without providing any explanations. In this paper, we incorporate XAI into face anti-spoofing and propose a new problem termed X-FAS (eXplainable Face Anti-Spoofing) empowering face anti-spoofing models to provide an explanation. We propose SPTD (SPoof Trace Discovery), an X-FAS method which can discover spoof concepts and provide reliable explanations on the basis of discovered concepts. To evaluate the quality of X-FAS methods, we propose an X-FAS benchmark with annotated spoof traces by experts. We analyze SPTD explanations on face anti-spoofing dataset and compare SPTD quantitatively and qualitatively with previous XAI methods on proposed X-FAS benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate SPTD's ability to generate reliable explanations.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions. However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.

Abstract: Clothed avatar generation has wide applications in virtual and augmented reality, filmmaking, and more. Previous methods have achieved success in generating diverse digital avatars, however, generating avatars with disentangled components (\eg, body, hair, and clothes) has long been a challenge. In this paper, we propose LayerAvatar, the first feed-forward diffusion-based method for generating component-disentangled clothed avatars. To achieve this, we first propose a layered UV feature plane representation, where components are distributed in different layers of the Gaussian-based UV feature plane with corresponding semantic labels. This representation supports high-resolution and real-time rendering, as well as expressive animation including controllable gestures and facial expressions. Based on the well-designed representation, we train a single-stage diffusion model and introduce constrain terms to address the severe occlusion problem of the innermost human body layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of our method in generating disentangled clothed avatars, and we further explore its applications in component transfer.

Abstract: We introduce ActiveGAMER, an active mapping system that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-quality, real-time scene mapping and exploration. Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.

Abstract: Multi-map Sparse Monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping applied to monocular endoscopic sequences has proven efficient to robustly recover tracking after the frequent losses in endoscopy due to motion blur, temporal occlusion, tools interaction or water jets. The sparse multi-maps are adequate for robust camera localization, however they are very poor for environment representation, they are noisy, with a high percentage of inaccurately reconstructed 3D points, including significant outliers, and more importantly with an unacceptable low density for clinical applications.
  We propose a method to remove outliers and densify the maps of the state of the art for sparse endoscopy multi-map CudaSIFT-SLAM. The NN LightDepth for up-to-scale depth dense predictions are aligned with the sparse CudaSIFT submaps by means of the robust to spurious LMedS. Our system mitigates the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation while filtering outliers, leading to reliable densified 3D maps.
  We provide experimental evidence of accurate densified maps 4.15 mm RMS accuracy at affordable computing time in the C3VD phantom colon dataset. We report qualitative results on the real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset.

Abstract: Preference alignment has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) following supervised fine-tuning. While existing preference alignment methods predominantly target hallucination factors, they overlook the factors essential for multi-modal comprehension capabilities, often narrowing their improvements on hallucination mitigation. To bridge this gap, we propose Instruction-oriented Preference Alignment (IPA), a scalable framework designed to automatically construct alignment preferences grounded in instruction fulfillment efficacy. Our method involves an automated preference construction coupled with a dedicated verification process that identifies instruction-oriented factors, avoiding significant variability in response representations. Additionally, IPA incorporates a progressive preference collection pipeline, further recalling challenging samples through model self-evolution and reference-guided refinement. Experiments conducted on Qwen2VL-7B demonstrate IPA's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including hallucination evaluation, visual question answering, and text understanding tasks, highlighting its capability to enhance general comprehension.

Abstract: Driverless train operation for open tracks on urban guided transport and mainline railways requires, among other things automatic detection of actual and potential obstacles, especially humans, in the danger zone of the train's path. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be powerful state-of-the-art tools for this task. However, these algorithms require large amounts of high-quality annotated data containing human beings in railway-specific environments as training data. Unfortunately, the amount of publicly available datasets is not yet sufficient and is significantly inferior to the datasets in the road domain. Therefore, this paper presents RailGoerl24, an on-board visual light Full HD camera dataset of 12205 frames recorded in a railway test center of T\"UV S\"UD Rail, in G\"orlitz, Germany. Its main purpose is to support the development of driverless train operation for guided transport. RailGoerl24 also includes a terrestrial LiDAR scan covering parts of the area used to acquire the RGB data. In addition to the raw data, the dataset contains 33556 boxwise annotations in total for the object class 'person'. The faces of recorded actors are not blurred or altered in any other way. RailGoerl24, available at data.fid-move.de/dataset/railgoerl24, can also be used for tasks beyond collision prediction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions represented as two joints or first predict points before determining connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties.

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models of our YOLOv13 model are available at: https://github.com/iMoonLab/yolov13.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Accurate histopathological grading of CRC is essential for prognosis and treatment planning but remains a subjective process prone to observer variability and limited by global shortages of trained pathologists. To promote automated and standardized solutions, we organized the ICIP Grand Challenge on Colorectal Cancer Tumor Grading and Segmentation using the publicly available METU CCTGS dataset. The dataset comprises 103 whole-slide images with expert pixel-level annotations for five tissue classes. Participants submitted segmentation masks via Codalab, evaluated using metrics such as macro F-score and mIoU. Among 39 participating teams, six outperformed the Swin Transformer baseline (62.92 F-score). This paper presents an overview of the challenge, dataset, and the top-performing methods

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate surface estimation is critical for downstream tasks in scientific simulation, and quantifying uncertainty in implicit neural 3D representations still remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. However, current neural implicit surface models do not offer a principled way to quantify uncertainty, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Inspired by recent probabilistic rendering approaches, we introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty estimation in neural implicit 3D representations. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) provide continuous, differentiable surface representations, making them especially well-suited for uncertainty-aware modeling. BayesSDF applies a Laplace approximation over SDF weights and derives Hessian-based metrics to estimate local geometric instability. We empirically demonstrate that these uncertainty estimates correlate strongly with surface reconstruction error across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. By enabling surface-aware uncertainty quantification, BayesSDF lays the groundwork for more robust, interpretable, and actionable 3D perception systems.

Abstract: A challenge in advancing Visual-Language Models (VLMs) is determining whether their failures on abstract reasoning tasks, such as Bongard problems, stem from flawed perception or faulty top-down reasoning. To disentangle these factors, we introduce a diagnostic framework centered on the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance achievable by a linear classifier on a VLM's raw visual embeddings. Applying this framework to state-of-the-art VLMs, we uncover a pervasive "alignment gap", where most models fail to generatively outperform the linear separability of their own representations. We find that the few models surpassing this ceiling do so via two mechanisms: by further refining visual representations into a more linearly separable format or by executing non-linear decision logic. We demonstrate that this bottleneck is not a fundamental limitation but a solvable alignment issue. By augmenting standard next-token prediction with a contrastive objective, our fine-tuning method activates dormant reasoning pathways, systematically improving the linear structure of representations to significantly surpass the LSC.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information, weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at royyang0714.github.io/3D-MOOD.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.

<title>Online 3D Gaussian Splatting Modeling with Novel View Selection</title>

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Abstract: We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model. Demos are shown in https://junzhan2000.github.io/AnyGPT.github.io/

Abstract: Purpose: To present a high-performing, robust, and flexible deep learning pipeline for automatic segmentation of 30 organs-at-risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer patients, using MRI, CT, or both. Method: We trained a segmentation pipeline on paired CT and MRI-T1 scans from 296 patients. We combined data from the H&amp;N OARs CT and MR segmentation (HaN-Seg) challenge and the Burdenko and GLIS-RT datasets from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). MRI was rigidly registered to CT, and both were stacked as input to an nnU-Net pipeline. Left and right OARs were merged into single classes during training and separated at inference time based on anatomical position. Modality Dropout was applied during the training, ensuring the model would learn from both modalities and robustly handle missing modalities during inference. The trained model was evaluated on the HaN-Seg test set and three TCIA datasets. Predictions were also compared with Limbus AI software. Dice Score (DS) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The pipeline achieved state-of-the-art performance on the HaN-Seg challenge with a mean DS of 78.12% and HD of 3.42 mm. On TCIA datasets, the model maintained strong agreement with Limbus AI software (DS: 77.43% , HD: 3.27 mm), while also flagging low-quality contours. The pipeline can segment seamlessly from the CT, the MRI scan, or both. Conclusion: The proposed pipeline achieved the best DS and HD scores among all HaN-Seg challenge participants and establishes a new state-of-the-art for fully automated, multi-modal segmentation of H&amp;N OARs.

Abstract: We present an active mapping system that plans for both long-horizon exploration goals and short-term actions using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Existing methods either do not take advantage of recent developments in multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) or do not consider challenges in localization uncertainty, which is critical in embodied agents. We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction with detailed motion planning using our information-based objective. By leveraging high-quality view synthesis from our 3DGS representation, our method employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration goals from the semantic perspective. We also introduce an uncertainty-aware path proposal and selection algorithm that balances the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.

Abstract: Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this, we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy, research, and regulation.

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Summary:
CAD generative modeling has made significant strides in creating solid models from inputs like point clouds and meshes, but transforming 2D engineering drawings into parametric CAD models remains underexplored. Drawing2CAD reframes this process as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, utilizing a network-friendly vector primitive representation, a dual-decoder transformer architecture, and a soft target distribution loss function. The method aims to preserve geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, the CAD-VGDrawing dataset was created and thorough experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. The code and dataset are publicly available for further research and application. <div>

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary:
The article introduces a General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. The framework improves upon existing methods by using high-level feature prediction instead of low-level reconstruction, leading to more efficient and meaningful representations. A target generation network dynamically generates supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, improving diversity in the features learned. The framework incorporates constrained optimization to prevent model collapse and ensure feature diversity. Experimental results on datasets demonstrate the benefits of the approach: 6.2 times faster training than standard methods and superior performance in various downstream tasks. The GFP framework achieves state-of-the-art results in action recognition tasks, showcasing its computational efficiency and representation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse. Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Summary: 
Mitotic figure counting is time-consuming and prone to variability among pathologists. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating mitotic figure detection using pixel-level segmentation. However, AI tools can be affected by domain shift, leading to decreased performance. This study presents a teacher-student model that simultaneously detects mitotic figures and classifies atypical mitoses. The model incorporates domain generalization modules, including contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training, to improve robustness against domain shift. A multi-scale CNN classifier is utilized for atypical mitosis classification within a multi-task learning framework. The algorithm achieved promising results on a preliminary test set, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating segmentation-based detection and classification for robust mitosis analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency. However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets, including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for robust mitosis analysis.

<div> framework, Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation, biases, vision models, fairness <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a framework designed to address multiple overlapping biases in real-world images that affect the performance of vision models. GMBM consists of two stages: Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) to identify bias shortcuts and Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning to prune bias directions from the network. Existing bias metrics are shown to be inadequate and a new measure called Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) is introduced. GMBM is validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets, resulting in improved group accuracy, reduced bias amplification, and low bias at test time. This makes GMBM the first practical solution for addressing multiple biases in visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. The framework is available on the project page: http://visdomlab.github.io/GMBM/ <br /> <div>

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end multibias solution for visual recognition.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study, incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net (2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89 for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration. Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable generalization.

<div> Keyword: Close-range laser scanning, 3D point cloud data, tree instance segmentation, unsupervised method, Python implementation
Summary: 
The article introduces a revised version of the treeX algorithm, a resource-efficient method for processing 3D point cloud data from close-range laser scanning to extract individual trees. This unsupervised method combines clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation, offering two parameter presets for ground-based and UAV-borne laser scanning. Evaluation on six public datasets shows improved accuracy and reduced runtime compared to the original treeX algorithm, with gains in instance detection F$_1$-score for ground-based data. The method achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58 for UAV-borne laser scanning, outperforming the original algorithm. The algorithm's design makes it a suitable alternative to deep learning approaches when data characteristics align with its design, and it can also be used for generating labels for deep learning models semi-automatically. An open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package is provided for broader adoption. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso, RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design (sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

<div> Keywords: Large Multimodal Models, 3D scene understanding, Reg3D, Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning, spatial reasoning

Summary: 
The paper introduces Reg3D, a framework that enhances 3D scene understanding by incorporating geometric supervision during training. Existing approaches lack the necessary geometric constraints for robust 3D spatial representations, which Reg3D addresses by focusing on reconstructing underlying geometric structures. Unlike other methods, Reg3D utilizes a dual-supervision paradigm that includes 3D information as input and learning targets. By implementing object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder architecture, Reg3D encourages spatial reasoning capabilities and ensures geometric consistency. Experimental results on various datasets show that Reg3D outperforms existing methods, offering significant performance improvements and establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations. In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models, which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal, multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems. More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system will be publicly released to promote research in this field: https://github.com/ucla-mobility/QuantV2X.

Summary:
LayoutGKN is introduced as an efficient method for comparing floor plan graphs, essential for various applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. Unlike graph matching networks, LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture. This is achieved by using a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. Despite its streamlined approach, LayoutGKN is shown to compute similarity as effectively as graph matching networks while significantly reducing inference time. The open-source code and data for LayoutGKN are available on GitHub, allowing for further exploration and development in this area. <div>

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing the speed. \href{https://github.com/caspervanengelenburg/LayoutGKN}{Code and data} are open.

Summary:
CLIP-SVD is a new adaptation technique for vision-language models, specifically CLIP, that uses Singular Value Decomposition to modify the internal parameter space for domain adaptation without additional modules. This approach allows for fine-tuning only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices, enhancing adaptation performance using only 0.04% of the model's total parameters while preserving generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on natural and biomedical datasets under few-shot settings. The code is available on GitHub for public use. Additionally, a natural language-based approach is used to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation, providing interpretability for CLIP-SVD.

Summary: <br /><br />CLIP-SVD is a novel adaptation technique for vision-language models like CLIP, using Singular Value Decomposition to modify parameter space for domain adaptation efficiently.

arXiv:2509.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and \textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

<div> Neural Architecture Search, Edge devices, Shape-Texture Attention Module, Precision Agriculture, Plant Disease Diagnosis <br />
Summary:<br />
Responding to the increasing need for global food security, leveraging precision agriculture and deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis is essential. However, deploying high-precision models on edge devices poses a challenge. Existing lightweight networks often lack the ability to capture subtle pathological features. To address this issue, a two-step solution is proposed: utilizing a training-free neural architecture search method to design an efficient network backbone for edge devices, and introducing the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM enhances attention by incorporating deformable convolutions and a Gabor filter bank for shape and texture awareness, respectively. The STA-Net model, incorporating STAM, achieved impressive accuracy and F1 scores on the CCMT plant disease dataset. Ablation studies confirmed the significant performance improvements provided by STAM over baseline and standard attention models. This innovative approach of integrating domain knowledge through decoupled attention holds promise for AI-based precision agriculture in edge deployments. <div>
arXiv:2509.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches -- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs) reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is available at https://github.com/RzMY/STA-Net.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

<div> Keywords: Image diffusion models, temporal inductive bias, video frames, HandCo dataset, generative diversity

Summary:
Image diffusion models are traditionally trained on static images, which limits their ability to capture temporal dynamics. A new training strategy is proposed in this work that utilizes the temporal information present in continuous video frames to enhance diffusion training. This strategy does not require any changes to the model architecture and can seamlessly integrate into existing training pipelines. The method is evaluated on the HandCo dataset, focusing on hand-object interactions with diverse finger articulations. Empirical results show that the proposed approach accelerates convergence, reduces FID on both training and validation distributions, and enhances generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations. An optimization analysis reveals that the regularization employed in this method reduces gradient variance, contributing to faster convergence. Overall, this work presents a simple yet effective way to improve the training of image diffusion models using temporal information. 

<br /><br />Summary: Image diffusion models are enhanced through a new training strategy leveraging temporal information in video frames. The approach accelerates convergence, reduces FID, and increases generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations. Regularization reduces gradient variance, aiding faster convergence. <div>
arXiv:2509.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images. While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over 2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which contributes to faster convergence.

Summary:<br />
Radiologic diagnostic errors, including under-reading errors and communication failures, continue to be prevalent in clinical practice. Existing 3D vision-language models struggle to address these issues, lacking local-global understanding and struggling with report variability. In response, MedVista3D is introduced as a multi-scale semantic-enriched framework for 3D CT analysis. This framework aligns local and global image-text information to improve disease detection and interpretation. By utilizing language model rewrites and a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank, MedVista3D addresses report variability and semantic inconsistencies. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering tasks. Additionally, it transfers effectively to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. MedVista3D demonstrates the potential to enhance radiologic diagnosis by improving spatial reasoning, report interpretation, and disease detection accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness, and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging, where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However, existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly, lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be released.

<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces CaPL, a novel method for prompt learning in vision-language models like CLIP, focusing on improving performance on fine-grained datasets. CaPL utilizes a causality-guided approach to text prompt learning through visual granulation, allowing for capturing subtle differences among classes. The method consists of two key modules: attribute disentanglement, which separates visual features into shared and class-specific attributes, and granule learning, which constructs visual granules for better recognition using causal inference. By leveraging learned visual granules, CaPL enhances the discriminative power of text prompts. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the superiority of CaPL over existing prompt learning methods, particularly on fine-grained datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.

Existing state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental \textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then, build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214 times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released once accepted.

<div> adaptive collaborative sparsification, multimodal features, efficient integration, event-guided, cross-modality fusion
Summary: 
FocusMamba introduces adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features by leveraging an Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy to discard low-information regions within each modality based on scene content changes perceived by the event camera. This approach efficiently integrates complementary features from both modalities using a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module. Experimental results on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate superior performance in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. The proposed method achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency by selectively retaining informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. The code for FocusMamba will be available at the GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data) uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR) to address the challenge of recognizing unseen food categories. It identifies three main challenges in CZSFR: the presence of redundant background information, role confusion between staple and side dishes, and semantic bias in attribute understanding. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a context-aware method called SalientFusion, consisting of two components: SalientFormer, which removes background redundancy and resolves role confusion, and DebiasAT, which reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as popular general datasets for CZSL. The code for SalientFusion is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However, CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer, which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL.

Summary: 
The paper introduces OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that addresses challenges in generating high-fidelity long-term occupancy while maintaining computational efficiency. By reframing the model as a temporal next-scale prediction task, OccTENS decomposes spatial and temporal sequence modeling to improve efficiency and combat temporal degradation. Leveraging a TensFormer architecture, OccTENS effectively captures spatial relationships and temporal causality in occupancy sequences. The model introduces a holistic pose aggregation strategy to enhance pose controllability, offering unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments demonstrate that OccTENS outperforms existing methods in both occupancy quality and inference speed. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<div> Keywords: dense correspondences, shape reconstruction, robot manipulation, weakly-supervised learning, vision-language models

Summary: 
In this study, the focus is on establishing dense correspondences across images, particularly in the context of matching different categories based on object function. The concept of dense functional correspondence is introduced, utilizing a weakly-supervised learning approach that combines vision-language models and dense contrastive learning. By leveraging pseudo-labeling and multi-view images, the model can predict functional parts and spatial relationships effectively. Synthetic and real evaluation datasets were curated for benchmarking, showcasing the superiority of this approach over baseline solutions. The integration of functional and spatial knowledge leads to improved performance in tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new reference-free Representational Similarity (RS) metric called SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore) for evaluating long image captions. Traditional n-gram-based metrics are limited in capturing semantic correctness, while metrics based on large language models are expensive for iterative use. SPECS is designed to emphasize specificity, rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. The metric shows strong correlation with human judgments, matching the performance of LLM-based metrics while being more efficient. SPECS is a practical alternative for evaluating image captioning models during development, providing a valuable tool for researchers in the field. <div>

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive 3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.

<div> Keywords: tubular structures, topological refinement, 3D reconstruction, persistent homology, anatomical modeling

Summary:
TopoSculpt is a novel framework designed for topological refinement of 3D tubular structures in medical imaging applications. It takes a holistic approach to modeling by considering the entire region in context. The introduction of the Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint helps enforce Betti number priors and global integrity, leading to improved accuracy in geometry and topology. By implementing a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology, TopoSculpt can progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales. Experimental results on pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets show significant enhancements in topological correctness, with a substantial reduction in errors and improved detection rates for various metrics. Overall, TopoSculpt demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing critical topological errors and advancing the accurate modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii) first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

<div> Keywords: Negative labels, Out-of-Distribution detection, Multimodal large language models, Near-OOD performance, ImageNet benchmark

Summary:
The paper introduces a new method called Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. By utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the proposed method shapes a negative textual space by generating descriptive negative sentences for OOD images, improving far-OOD detection. For near-OOD scenarios, where OOD samples resemble in-distribution (ID) classes, ANTS identifies visually similar ID classes and generates tailored negative labels to reduce false negatives and enhance detection. An adaptive weighted score is designed to balance near-OOD and far-OOD settings without prior knowledge, leading to improved adaptability in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, ANTS decreases the FPR95 by 4.2% without the need for training, establishing a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection. This zero-shot and highly scalable method showcases the effectiveness of leveraging MLLMs in shaping an adaptive negative textual space. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD), most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal RSCD.

<div> Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL), WSI classification, positional encoding module, SAC block, instance correlations <br />
<br />
SAC-MIL proposes a novel approach for WSI classification by incorporating a positional encoding module and a SAC block. The positional encoding module encodes spatial relationships using instance coordinates, addressing length extrapolation issues in training and testing sequences. The SAC block utilizes an MLP-based method for full instance correlation with linear time complexity. This simple structure allows for easy deployment without requiring custom CUDA kernels, unlike Transformer-based methods. SAC-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be made available upon acceptance. <br />

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<div> Keywords: liver vessel segmentation, magnetic resonance imaging, multi-task learning, contrast-enhanced imaging, annotated data

Summary: 
Liver vessel segmentation in MRI data is crucial for analyzing vascular changes in liver diseases. Current methods rely on contrast-enhanced images, which are not always available. A new multi-task learning framework has been proposed to segment vessels in liver MRI without contrast by leveraging auxiliary contrast-enhanced data during training. This approach reduces the need for annotated examples and enhances segmentation accuracy, even without auxiliary data during inference. The framework benefits from shared task structures and can improve segmentation accuracy, especially with limited annotations. This technique has also shown positive results in brain tumor segmentation, demonstrating its versatility across different medical imaging domains. Utilizing auxiliary informative imaging modalities during training can enhance expert annotations and improve segmentation results. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few annotations are available for training, since the feature representation benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert annotations even if it is only available during training.

Prompt design for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is crucial yet not well understood. Minor variations in prompt phrasing can significantly impact the accuracy of models, up to 15%. This variability challenges transparent and fair evaluation as models tend to showcase their best performance with selective prompts. The Promptception framework, with 61 prompt types in various categories and supercategories, evaluates the sensitivity of 10 LMMs across 3 MCQA benchmarks. Proprietary models display higher sensitivity to prompt phrasing, while open-source models are more consistent but struggle with complex phrasing. This analysis leads to the proposal of Prompting Principles tailored for both proprietary and open-source LMMs, aiming to improve robustness and fairness in model evaluation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Driven by the demands of autonomous driving, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has gained importance. While traditional methods focus on 2D representations, this study utilizes a 3D voxel grid to capture semantic variations along the vertical axis. The proposed SliceSemOcc framework extracts voxel features along the height axis using global and local vertical slices, enabling a fusion of spatial details and contextual information. The SEAttention3D module assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer, enhancing feature emphasis at different heights. Experiment results on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets show improved mean IoU, especially for small-object categories, validating the effectiveness of the novel framework. <div>

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc framework.

<div> spurious correlations, neural network, computer vision, detection, ImageNet<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Neural network models in computer vision can unintentionally rely on spurious correlations in data, resulting in incorrect predictions based on irrelevant signals. A novel method is proposed to detect such spurious correlations in vision transformers, with experiments on ImageNet dataset showing effectiveness. The training methodology significantly influences model reliance on spurious correlations. Certain ImageNet classes contain easily detectable spurious signals. Caution is advised in using images with spurious signals in research. A case study on invasive breast mass classification illustrates the impact of spurious signals in real-world scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2509.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world scenarios.

Summary: <br /><br />The paper introduces a new multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML), where the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. A Counting Network is proposed to address LML by estimating bag-level majority labels through class instance counting. Experiment analysis reveals that bags with a higher proportion of the majority class aid in learning, leading to the development of the Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to enhance the majority class proportion by removing minority class instances.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over 98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets: MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to other re-ranking methods.

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) with weakly supervised labels. The proposed approach combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module to address the limitations of existing methods. By leveraging the strengths of both modules, the method injects semantic information into audio and visual features and propagates this information across time for improved temporal modeling. This process helps in locating cleaner semantic cues and refining pseudo-labels for better training. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying event categories and occurrence times in videos. The combination of BiT and CATS modules demonstrates significant advancements in AVVP tasks, showcasing the potential of integrating multiple research directions for improved results.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

To address the real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation.

DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2) real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool, preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0 event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-story visualization, character consistency, dialogue rendering, iterative process, identity-consistent self-attention 

Summary:
TaleDiffusion is a new framework for generating multi-character stories with a focus on maintaining character consistency and accurate dialogue rendering. It uses a pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues, followed by a technique to control character interactions and minimize artifacts. An identity-consistent self-attention mechanism ensures consistency across frames, and region-aware cross-attention helps with precise object placement. Dialogues are rendered as bubbles and assigned to characters using CLIPSeg. Experimental results show that TaleDiffusion performs better than existing methods in terms of consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering. This framework addresses the challenges of text-to-story visualization by emphasizing character interactions, accurate dialogue assignment, and maintaining a cohesive storytelling experience. It shows significant improvements in generating coherent and visually appealing multi-character narratives.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Multi-Expert Planning and Generation Framework (MEPG) to enhance text-to-image diffusion models. It combines position- and style-aware large language models with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework consists of a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module for precise decomposition of input prompts and a Multi-Expert Diffusion (MED) module for cross-region generation through expert routing. During generation, specialized models are activated based on spatial partitioning. The architecture allows for easy integration and replacement of expert models and supports real-time spatial layout editing and style selection. Experimental results demonstrate that MEPG outperforms baseline models in both image quality and style diversity. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers focus on evaluating deepfake detectors using the "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. They revisit a baseline approach, achieving 81% accuracy by tuning hyperparameters, surpassing previous results by 18% and competing with commercial detectors. The study explores tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability, considering practical deployment in real-world settings. The code for the improved deepfake detector is available at https://github.com/Deepfake-Detection-KKO/deepfake-detection. <div>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability, focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in real-world settings.

Summary: 
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used to monitor wind power plants, including critical components like blades and towers, using advanced sensors. To improve defect detection accuracy, a research study developed an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrated visible and thermal channels. The proposed ensemble approach combined a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model and utilized a bounding box fusion algorithm to merge their predictions. Experiments demonstrated that this approach outperformed a standalone YOLOv8 model, achieving a mean Average Precision of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90. By combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data, the detection of visual and thermal defects in wind power plants was significantly improved.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers, and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal defects.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations. Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.

<div> Keywords: Vision Language Models, LASER, active perception capabilities, coordinate prediction, IoU-based region quality evaluation

Summary:<br />
Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in integrating visual perception and linguistic reasoning. The LASER framework proposed in this work aims to enhance VLMs' ability to reason over appropriate image regions, particularly in complex visual interactions. By combining Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation, LASER guides VLMs to focus on instruction-relevant key regions and adaptively allocate reasoning steps based on task complexity. Experimental results on ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements. When fine-tuned on the GTA1-7B dataset, LASER achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark among 7B-scale models. This approach effectively enables VLMs to enhance their multi-step perception capabilities, leading to more precise coordinate predictions and improved downstream task performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically, our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Summary:
This study explores enhancing semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery by incorporating the differential morphological profile (DMP) into modern segmentation networks. The DMP, a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, provides critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks for better performance in overhead imagery analysis. The researchers extend prior work by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architectures. They evaluate different DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to enhance shape information for the model. Results show that hybrid DMP models consistently outperform direct-input variants and can surpass non-DMP models on metrics like mIoU, F1, and Recall. This approach addresses challenges specific to remote sensing imagery such as extreme scale variation and foreground-background imbalance, making it a promising technique for applications in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.

<div> Keywords: tau pathology, positron emission tomography, Alzheimer's disease, plasma biomarkers, 3D diffusion model

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach for synthesizing 3D tau PET images using a text-guided 3D diffusion model. By incorporating information from plasma measurements and structural MRI, the proposed framework can generate realistic tau PET images that provide valuable insights into Alzheimer's disease progression. The use of textual prompts from plasma p-tau217 measurements and anatomical constraints from MRI data allows for the accurate representation of tau pathology across different disease stages. The synthesized images offer a cost-effective and non-invasive alternative for visualizing tau pathology, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring AD. Additionally, the framework can be used for tau PET data augmentation and simulating disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions. Overall, this approach enhances our understanding of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and has the potential to improve diagnostic and monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography (PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint, ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show the superiority of the proposed method.

arXiv:2509.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline, providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning tasks.

<title>GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-language Models on WorldWide Image Geolocalization</title>

arXiv:2509.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

arXiv:2509.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions. To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

<title>AnomalyLMM: Bridging Generative Knowledge and Discriminative Retrieval for Text-Based Person Anomaly Search</title>

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.

<title>Aesthetic Image Captioning with Saliency Enhanced MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<title>SSGaussian: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserving 3D Style Transfer</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

<title>Learning neural representations for X-ray ptychography reconstruction with unknown probes</title>

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable, physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

<title>Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

<title>Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

<title>Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest (ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception, omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity, making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity. Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300 research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of panoramic vision technologies.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary evolution.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification, stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide insights for future optimization research.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global (non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input. Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians. However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models, directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge. ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively), while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However, limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liuxiaojieOutOfWorld/MobileRAG_arxiv

<title>TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media</title>

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach, approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters, but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations. Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner.

<title>SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation. However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15 objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic alignment with natural hand motion.

<title>Global-to-Local or Local-to-Global? Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking</title>

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost. Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

<title>Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective</title>

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost, while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators, TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision + tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

Abstract: Recently, deep learning-based methods have dominated image dehazing domain. A multi-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream feature attention block (MSFAB) and the cross non-local block (CNLB) is presented in this paper to further enhance the performance. We start with extracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, a multi-stream feature extraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with different receptive fields (i.e., $1\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $5\times 5$), is designed for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, an attention sub-block is employed to make the model adaptively focus on important channels/regions. These two sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a cross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond the query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value branches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is computation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS) strategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive regularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and ignoring the high-level semantic information in a representation space specially designed for dehazing. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing methods with less than 1.5 Million parameters.

Abstract: Flow matching as a paradigm of generative model achieves notable success across various domains. However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straightening trajectories to few-step generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy from the entire distribution level. More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps. Moreover, our unconditional StraightFM is seamlessly compatible with training-free multimodal conditional generation, maintaining high-quality image generation in few steps.

Abstract: This work examines the reproducibility and benchmarking of state-of-the-art real-time object detection models. As object detection models are often used in real-world contexts, such as robotics, where inference time is paramount, simply measuring models' accuracy is not enough to compare them. We thus compare a large variety of object detection models' accuracy and inference speed on multiple graphics cards. In addition to this large benchmarking attempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on the MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we propose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's features, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could not achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in the original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could match such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking for reproducibility purposes. As for MMDetection pretrained models, speed performances are severely reduced with limited computing resources (larger, more accurate models even more so). Moreover, results exhibit a strong trade-off between accuracy and speed, prevailed by anchor-free models - notably RTMDet or YOLOx models. The code used is this paper and all the experiments is available in the repository at https://github.com/willGuimont/segdet_mlcr2024.

Abstract: Synthetic image attribution addresses the problem of tracing back the origin of images produced by generative models. Extensive efforts have been made to explore unique representations of generative models and use them to attribute a synthetic image to the model that produced it. Most of the methods classify the models or the architectures among those in a closed set without considering the possibility that the system is fed with samples produced by unknown architectures. With the continuous progress of AI technology, new generative architectures continuously appear, thus driving the attention of researchers towards the development of tools capable of working in open-set scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for open set attribution of synthetic images, named BOSC (Backdoor-based Open Set Classification), that relies on the concept of backdoor attacks to design a classifier with rejection option. BOSC works by purposely injecting class-specific triggers inside a portion of the images in the training set to induce the network to establish a matching between class features and trigger features. The behavior of the trained model with respect to triggered samples is then exploited at test time to perform sample rejection using an ad-hoc score. Experiments show that the proposed method has good performance, always surpassing the state-of-the-art. Robustness against image processing is also very good. Although we designed our method for the task of synthetic image attribution, the proposed framework is a general one and can be used for other image forensic applications.

Abstract: Existing optimization-based methods for non-rigid registration typically minimize an alignment error metric based on the point-to-point or point-to-plane distance between corresponding point pairs on the source surface and target surface. However, these metrics can result in slow convergence or a loss of detail. In this paper, we propose SPARE, a novel formulation that utilizes a symmetrized point-to-plane distance for robust non-rigid registration. The symmetrized point-to-plane distance relies on both the positions and normals of the corresponding points, resulting in a more accurate approximation of the underlying geometry and can achieve higher accuracy than existing methods. To solve this optimization problem efficiently, we introduce an as-rigid-as-possible regulation term to estimate the deformed normals and propose an alternating minimization solver using a majorization-minimization strategy. Moreover, for effective initialization of the solver, we incorporate a deformation graph-based coarse alignment that improves registration quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the accuracy of non-rigid registration problems and maintains relatively high solution efficiency. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yaoyx689/spare.

Abstract: Falling objects from buildings can cause severe injuries to pedestrians due to the great impact force they exert. Although surveillance cameras are installed around some buildings, it is challenging for humans to capture such events in surveillance videos due to the small size and fast motion of falling objects, as well as the complex background. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to automatically detect falling objects around buildings in surveillance videos. To facilitate the investigation of falling object detection, we propose a large, diverse video dataset called FADE (FAlling Object DEtection around Buildings) for the first time. FADE contains 1,881 videos from 18 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a new object detection method called FADE-Net, which effectively leverages motion information and produces small-sized but high-quality proposals for detecting falling objects around buildings. Importantly, our method is extensively evaluated and analyzed by comparing it with the previous approaches used for generic object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection on the FADE dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed FADE-Net significantly outperforms other methods, providing an effective baseline for future research. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://fadedataset.github.io/FADE.github.io/.

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for pixel-wise annotation tasks like semantic segmentation, where labeling requires significant effort and intensive labor. Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using Class-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Blending to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a class balancing algorithm to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers and U-Net architectures have been widely adopted in the implementation of Diffusion Models. However, each architecture presents specific challenges while realizing them on-device. Vision Transformers require positional embedding to maintain correspondence between the tokens processed by the transformer, although they offer the advantage of using fixed-size, reusable repetitive blocks following tokenization. The U-Net architecture lacks these attributes, as it utilizes variable-sized intermediate blocks for down-convolution and up-convolution in the noise estimation backbone for the diffusion process. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that utilizes a fixed-size, reusable transformer block as a core structure, making it more suitable for hardware implementation. Our architecture is characterized by low complexity, token-free design, absence of positional embeddings, uniformity, and scalability, making it highly suitable for deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices. The proposed model exhibit competitive and consistent performance across both unconditional and conditional image generation tasks. The model achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.6 on unconditional image generation with the CelebA.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.

<title>OFTSR: One-Step Flow for Image Super-Resolution with Tunable Fidelity-Realism Trade-offs</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow-based generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks, achieving superior perceptual quality compared to traditional deep learning approaches. However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

<title>Defending LVLMs Against Vision Attacks through Partial-Perception Supervision</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have raised significant concerns regarding the vulnerability of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to maliciously injected or perturbed input images, which can mislead their responses. Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models.

Abstract: With advancements in satellite imaging technology, acquiring high-resolution multi-view satellite imagery has become increasingly accessible, enabling rapid and location-independent ground model reconstruction. However, traditional stereo matching methods struggle to capture fine details, and while neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality reconstructions, their training time is prohibitively long. Moreover, challenges such as low visibility of building facades, illumination and style differences between pixels, and weakly textured regions in satellite imagery further make it hard to reconstruct reasonable terrain geometry and detailed building facades. To address these issues, we propose Sat-DN, a novel framework leveraging a progressively trained multi-resolution hash grid reconstruction architecture with explicit depth guidance and surface normal consistency constraints to enhance reconstruction quality. The multi-resolution hash grid accelerates training, while the progressive strategy incrementally increases the learning frequency, using coarse low-frequency geometry to guide the reconstruction of fine high-frequency details. The depth and normal constraints ensure a clear building outline and correct planar distribution. Extensive experiments on the DFC2019 dataset demonstrate that Sat-DN outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code is available at https://github.com/costune/SatDN.

Abstract: Image Captioning for state-of-the-art VLMs has significantly improved over time; however, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, making them less accessible for resource-constrained applications such as mobile devices and assistive technologies. Alternatively, comparably smaller VLMs prioritize high-level scene descriptions, overlooking finer details that contribute to a richer understanding of an image. In this paper, we introduce a training-free framework that enhances caption diversity and informativeness by explicitly attending to distinct image regions using a comparably small VLM, BLIP, as the backbone. Our approach leverages structured segmentation to produce hierarchical representations that capture both global and localized semantics. Without requiring additional model training, we demonstrate that our method allows smaller VLMs to achieve performance comparable to larger models in terms of image-caption alignment, semantic integrity, and diversity. We evaluate our framework on MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Nocaps test datasets, achieving a Div-2 score of 0.735, 0.750, and 0.748 for each dataset, respectively, while maintaining strong image-caption relevancy and semantic integrity with the human-annotated captions.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/CoDiff

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic lip movements and facial expressions for 3D head models from arbitrary audio clips. Although existing diffusion-based methods are capable of producing natural motions, their slow generation speed limits their application potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel autoregressive model that achieves real-time generation of highly synchronized lip movements and realistic head poses and eye blinks by learning a mapping from speech to a multi-scale motion codebook. Furthermore, our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles, enabling the creation of 3D talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during training. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in lip synchronization accuracy and perceived quality.

Abstract: Many applications of computer vision rely on the alignment of similar but non-identical images. We present a fast algorithm for aligning heterogeneous images based on optimal transport. Our approach combines the speed of fast Fourier methods with the robustness of sliced probability metrics and allows us to efficiently compute the alignment between two $L \times L$ images using the sliced 2-Wasserstein distance in $O(L^2 \log L)$ operations. We show that our method is robust to translations, rotations and deformations in the images.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of Computed Tomography (CT) scan examinations has created an urgent need for automated tools, such as organ segmentation, anomaly classification, and report generation, to assist radiologists with their growing workload. Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generative AI tools hold immense potential to assist users in the early ideation stages of creative tasks -- offering the ability to generate (rather than search for) novel and unprecedented (instead of existing) images of considerable quality that also adhere to boundless combinations of user specifications. However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks, thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.

Abstract: Objective. Motion artifacts in brain MRI, mainly from rigid head motion, degrade image quality and hinder downstream applications. Conventional methods to mitigate these artifacts, including repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, impose workflow burdens. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for MRI motion artifact correction.Approach.Res-MoCoDiff exploits a novel residual error shifting mechanism during the forward diffusion process to incorporate information from motion-corrupted images. This mechanism allows the model to simulate the evolution of noise with a probability distribution closely matching that of the corrupted data, enabling a reverse diffusion process that requires only four steps. The model employs a U-net backbone, with attention layers replaced by Swin Transformer blocks, to enhance robustness across resolutions. Furthermore, the training process integrates a combined l1+l2 loss function, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on both an in-silico dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and an in-vivo MR-ART dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and a diffusion model with a vision transformer backbone, using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE.Main results. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across minor, moderate, and heavy distortion levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced the field of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing research has predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions, which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the ease of transferability of modules. We then propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric that quantifies how readily a given module can be transplanted across models and reveals the combined influence of multiple existing metrics on transferability. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules: the Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and the Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, and other low-level tasks, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PSNR improvement of up to 0.83 dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity. Similar optimization approaches could be applied to a broader range of basic modules, offering a new paradigm for the design of plug-and-play modules.

Abstract: Traffic accident prediction and detection are critical for enhancing road safety, and vision-based traffic accident anticipation (Vision-TAA) has emerged as a promising approach in the era of deep learning. This paper reviews 147 recent studies, focusing on the application of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid deep learning models for accident prediction, alongside the use of real-world and synthetic datasets. Current methodologies are categorized into four key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatio-temporal feature-based prediction, scene understanding, and multi modal data fusion. While these methods demonstrate significant potential, challenges such as data scarcity, limited generalization to complex scenarios, and real-time performance constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future research, including the integration of multi modal data fusion, self-supervised learning, and Transformer-based architectures to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability. By synthesizing existing advancements and identifying critical gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for developing robust and adaptive Vision-TAA systems, contributing to road safety and traffic management.

Abstract: Foundation models provide robust embeddings for diverse tasks, including medical imaging. We evaluate embeddings from seven general and medical-specific foundation models (e.g., DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, CXR-Foundation) for training lightweight adapters in multi-class radiography classification. Using a dataset of 8,842 radiographs across seven classes, we trained adapters with algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and MLP. The combination of MedImageInsight embeddings with an SVM or MLP adapter achieved the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) of 93.1%. This performance was statistically superior to other models, including MedSigLIP with an MLP (91.0%), Rad-DINO with an SVM (90.7%), and CXR-Foundation with logistic regression (88.6%). In contrast, models like BiomedCLIP (82.8%) and Med-Flamingo (78.5%) showed lower performance. Crucially, these lightweight adapters are computationally efficient, training in minutes and performing inference in seconds on a CPU, making them practical for clinical use. A fairness analysis of the top-performing MedImageInsight adapter revealed minimal performance disparities across patient gender (within 1.8%) and age groups (std. dev < 1.4%), with no significant statistical differences. These findings confirm that embeddings from specialized foundation models, particularly MedImageInsight, can power accurate, efficient, and equitable diagnostic tools using simple, lightweight adapters.

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

Abstract: Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics. Our model and source code can be found at: https://github.com/xyz123xyz456/hallo4.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment, far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters. Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at https://github.com/OBAKSA/CPADNet.

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet the spatial extent of their ecological influence remains underexplored at high resolution. Here we present a deep learning and remote sensing based approach to estimate areas of pre-Columbian forest modification based on modern vegetation. We apply this method to high-resolution satellite imagery from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia, as a demonstration of a scalable approach, to evaluate palm tree distributions in relation to archaeological infrastructure. Palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological sites with large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated by current archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian populations influenced vegetation, fostering conditions conducive to palm proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in less accessible locations.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision by examining six influential papers. The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

While recent advances in large-scale 3D datasets have enhanced high-resolution geometry generation, creating high-resolution textures end-to-end remains underexplored due to the lack of suitable datasets. TexVerse fills this gap with a curated collection of over 858K unique high-resolution 3D models sourced from Sketchfab, including more than 158K models with physically based rendering (PBR) materials. Each model encompasses all of its high-resolution variants, bringing the total to 1.6M 3D instances. TexVerse also includes specialized subsets: TexVerse-Skeleton, with 69K rigged models, and TexVerse-Animation, with 54K animated models, both preserving original skeleton and animation data uploaded by the user. We also provide detailed model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components, and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally "looks again" the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the results indicate that enhancing expert models, which are typically small and easy to iterate, enable performance improvements for VLMs.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.

Abstract: Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, necessitates early detection for accurate and timely intervention to prevent irreversible vision loss. In this study, we present a novel deep learning framework that leverages the diagnostic value of 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging for automated glaucoma detection. In this framework, we integrate a pre-trained Vision Transformer on retinal data for rich slice-wise feature extraction and a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for capturing inter-slice spatial dependencies. This dual-component approach enables comprehensive analysis of local nuances and global structural integrity, crucial for accurate glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art ones, achieving an F1-score of 93.01%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 69.33%, and AUC of 94.20%. The framework's ability to leverage the valuable information in 3D OCT data holds significant potential for enhancing clinical decision support systems and improving patient outcomes in glaucoma management.

Abstract: This work presents an object-centric approach to learning vision-based manipulation skills from human videos. We investigate the problem of robot manipulation via imitation in the open-world setting, where a robot learns to manipulate novel objects from a single video demonstration. We introduce ORION, an algorithm that tackles the problem by extracting an object-centric manipulation plan from a single RGB or RGB-D video and deriving a policy that conditions on the extracted plan. Our method enables the robot to learn from videos captured by daily mobile devices and to generalize the policies to deployment environments with varying visual backgrounds, camera angles, spatial layouts, and novel object instances. We systematically evaluate our method on both short-horizon and long-horizon tasks, using RGB-D and RGB-only demonstration videos. Across varied tasks and demonstration types (RGB-D / RGB), we observe an average success rate of 74.4%, demonstrating the efficacy of ORION in learning from a single human video in the open world. Additional materials can be found on our project website: https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/ORION-release.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have leveraged extensive multimodal datasets to enhance capabilities in complex knowledge-driven tasks. However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. To address these issues, we introduce PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), a novel data format designed to foster a deeper integration of visual and textual knowledge. The PIN format uniquely combines semantically rich Markdown files, which preserve fine-grained textual structures, with holistic overall images that capture the complete document layout. Following this format, we construct and release two large-scale, open-source datasets: PIN-200M (~200 million documents) and PIN-14M (~14 million), compiled from diverse web and scientific sources in both English and Chinese. To maximize usability, we provide detailed statistical analyses and equip the datasets with quality signals, enabling researchers to easily filter and select data for specific tasks. Our work provides the community with a versatile data format and substantial resources, offering a foundation for new research in pre-training strategies and the development of more powerful knowledge-intensive LMMs.

Abstract: For the last three years, the AutoPET competition gathered the medical imaging community around a hot topic: lesion segmentation on Positron Emitting Tomography (PET) scans. Each year a different aspect of the problem is presented; in 2024 the multiplicity of existing and used tracers was at the core of the challenge. Specifically, this year's edition aims to develop a fully automatic algorithm capable of performing lesion segmentation on a PET/CT scan, without knowing the tracer, which can either be a FDG or PSMA-based tracer. In this paper we describe how we used the nnUNetv2 framework to train two sets of 6 fold ensembles of models to perform fully automatic PET/CT lesion segmentation as well as a MIP-CNN to choose which set of models to use for segmentation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset Distillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space. Compared to the previous SOTA method D\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better performance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class settings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion transformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) is transforming medical domain. In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.

Abstract: Microstructure of materials is often characterized through image analysis to understand processing-structure-properties linkages. We propose a largely automated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and, for multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous regions. With the advance of manufacturing and imaging techniques, the ultra-high resolution of imaging that reveals the complexity of microstructures and the rapidly increasing quantity of images (i.e., micrographs) enables and necessitates a more powerful and automated framework to extract materials characteristics and knowledge. The framework we propose can be used to gradually build a database of microstructure classes relevant to a particular process or group of materials, which can help in analyzing and discovering/identifying new materials. The framework has three steps: (1) segmentation of multiphase micrographs through a recently developed score-based method so that different microstructure homogeneous regions can be identified in an unsupervised manner; (2) {identification and classification of} homogeneous regions of micrographs through an uncertainty-aware supervised classification network trained using the segmented micrographs from Step $1$ with their identified labels verified via the built-in uncertainty quantification and minimal human inspection; (3) supervised segmentation (more powerful than the segmentation in Step $1$) of multiphase microstructures through a segmentation network trained with micrographs and the results from Steps $1$-$2$ using a form of data augmentation. This framework can iteratively characterize/segment new homogeneous or multiphase materials while expanding the database to enhance performance. The framework is demonstrated on various sets of materials and texture images.

Abstract: Automating the synthesis of coordinated bimanual piano performances poses significant challenges, particularly in capturing the intricate choreography between the hands while preserving their distinct kinematic signatures. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate synchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the critical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based generation framework that independently models each hand's motion via dual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while leveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated Asymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise to highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing inter-hand coordination during denoising. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics. Our project is available at https://monkek123king.github.io/S2C_page/.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

Abstract: Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be characterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their gradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call "excitation pullbacks", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the "path stability" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration of the excitation pullbacks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness, model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes (gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Summary:<br />
The study investigates the incorporation of motion in pixel-level visual grounding using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in videos. Existing benchmarks are limited in capturing motion, leading to the introduction of a motion-centric benchmark, MoCentric-Bench. Four probing techniques were developed to assess video MLLMs' ability to recognize true motion and motion order. Strong single-image baselines were established, challenging models to enhance spatiotemporal grounding in videos. The study provides insights into motion-language interaction in visual grounding tasks and proposes simple motion-centric adaptation techniques for improved performance. The findings emphasize the importance of dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding in videos. The code and datasets will be publicly available for further research and development at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark, MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench. Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation-2.0.git.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained, local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance. Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

<div> Reinforcement learning, active video acquisition, aortic stenosis, echocardiography, point-of-care ultrasound <br />
Summary: <br />
Researchers have developed a reinforcement learning-driven active video acquisition framework to improve the diagnosis of aortic stenosis (AS). AS, a dangerous condition caused by a narrowed aortic valve, often faces diagnostic limitations due to restricted access to echocardiography in rural and underserved areas. The proposed framework dynamically selects the most informative echo videos for each patient, optimizing accuracy and efficiency by continuously evaluating the need for additional imaging. Tested on data from 2,572 patients, the method achieved an 80.6% classification accuracy while using only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. This innovative approach showcases the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS diagnosis, enabling more efficient, scalable, and personalized echocardiographic assessments. The source code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence, access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from 2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and personalized.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche. This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O), pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover, slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O, pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3) visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization. However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale, high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs). The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario generation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework for improving LiDAR-based perception in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) by addressing the Sim2Real gap. The framework incorporates real-world background geometry, road topology, and sensor specifications to generate in-domain synthetic data. Training an object detector on HiFi DT-generated data leads to a 4.8% performance improvement compared to models trained on real data. Various metrics like Chamfer Distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Earth Mover's Distance, and Fréchet Distance are used to quantify the alignment between synthetic and real data, showing a substantial reduction in domain shift. These results highlight the significance of digital twins in enabling reliable simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world ITS applications.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking, segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf 3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world ITS applications.

arXiv:2509.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings, thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably, our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios. Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy) substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical AI systems.

Summary:
STAR (Serial Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration) is a new, fast, and robust framework for aligning serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs). It integrates stain-conditioned preprocessing and a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy to achieve reliable rigid registration across various tissue types and staining protocols. The framework includes adaptive kernel scaling and built-in quality control for improved alignment performance. STAR was evaluated on different datasets and showed stable alignments within minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability. The tool is open-source and lightweight, providing a reproducible baseline that can lower the barrier for clinical adoption and facilitate large-scale paired data preparation for AI workflows in computational pathology. Case studies on H&amp;E-IHC alignment, multi-IHC panels construction, and typical failure modes were presented, illustrating the utility and limitations of STAR.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols, including hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS, PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67). Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&amp;E-IHC alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes, underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for next-generation computational pathology.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection, Modality-missing, Cross-modal prompt learning, Symmetric contrastive learning, Triple-modal contrastive pre-training

Summary:
Cross-modal prompt learning is proposed to address modality-missing in multimodal industrial surface defect detection. It includes cross-modal consistency prompts, modality-specific prompts, and missing-aware prompts to handle information consistency and vacancy. Symmetric contrastive learning uses text modality as a bridge for fusion, employing paired antithetical text prompts and triple-modal contrastive pre-training for multimodal learning. Experimental results show superior performance over existing methods, achieving high I-AUROC and P-AUROC with a total missing rate of 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities. The proposed method outperforms competitors under different missing types and rates. The source code is available for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: Cross-modal prompt learning addresses modality-missing in multimodal defect detection, enabling information consistency and adaptation. Symmetric contrastive learning utilizes text as a fusion bridge, enhancing multimodal learning performance and outperforming existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

<div> Keywords: solar filaments, segmentation, EdgeAttNet, U-Net, MAGFILO dataset

Summary:
EdgeAttNet is a novel segmentation architecture designed to accurately segment solar filaments in H-alpha observations, capturing fine-scale structures such as barbs more effectively. It integrates a learnable edge map into the model to guide the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck, enhancing spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing trainable parameters. Compared to U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines, EdgeAttNet outperforms in segmentation accuracy and barb recognition on the MAGFILO dataset. It also provides faster inference performance, making it suitable for practical deployment. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods in capturing long-range dependencies and spatial detail, crucial for determining filament chirality and understanding the behavior of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). EdgeAttNet demonstrates the potential of incorporating structural priors into attention computations for improved segmentation performance in solar observations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Summary:<br />
Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving safety. The KEPT framework combines a TFSF video encoder with a retrieval stack for scene-aligned exemplars, enhancing model reasoning with domain knowledge. By embedding retrieved priors into CoT prompts and incrementally aligning language with spatial cues, motion feasibility, and temporal planning, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset. Three fine-tuning stages contribute to improved accuracy and safety, with Top-2 retrieved exemplars offering the best trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index supports efficient retrieval, enabling practical deployment of interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving models.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Summary: 
InstaDA proposes a novel Dual-Agent system for augmenting instance segmentation datasets. The Text-Agent (T-Agent) enhances data diversity through collaboration between large language models and diffusion models, utilizing a Prompt Rethink mechanism to refine prompts iteratively. The Image-Agent (I-Agent) enriches data distribution by generating new instances conditioned on training images. Both agents operate as independent and automated workflows for practicality and efficiency. Experimental results on the LVIS 1.0 validation set show significant improvements in box and mask average precision compared to baseline and outperforming the leading model, DiverGen. InstaDA achieves a notable performance improvement on common and frequent categories, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing instance segmentation datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.

The Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module generates global and local prototypes to measure similarities between support and query images. The Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE) module refines support prototypes based on guidance from the query image, addressing discrepancies.

arXiv:2509.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image, overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE) module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance.

Summary: 
SOPSeg is a prompt-based framework designed specifically for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery. It addresses the lack of datasets for small object instance segmentation by introducing a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve fine details and a customized decoder for accurate boundary delineation. A novel prompting mechanism tailored to oriented bounding boxes is also implemented. Compared to existing methods, SOPSeg outperforms in small object segmentation and aids in efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of current methods, such as the loss of fine spatial details in small object segmentation. Additionally, a comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A is constructed to support future research. Both the model and dataset will be released to facilitate advancements in small object segmentation for remote sensing applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery. It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation. Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Summary: 
The study focuses on enhancing the robustness of post-processing watermarking by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. Different versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in spatial and frequency domains are constructed to analyze their impact on the watermarking model's robustness. Results show that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain achieves the highest robustness. Evaluation on the WAVES benchmark indicates that the ensemble attack network improves the robustness of baseline watermarking methods, with a significant enhancement in performance against the Regeneration Attack scenario, improving StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark. <div>
arXiv:2509.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released at:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark.

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, visual grounding, Feed-Forward Network, Visual Absence-aware neurons, detection module

Summary:
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often incorrectly perceive text inputs without visual evidence as part of the image, resulting in inaccurate responses. This study investigates LVLMs' ability to determine if textual concepts are grounded in the image and identifies Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons in the Feed-Forward Network that signal visual absence. A detection module is developed based on VA neuron activation patterns to classify visually grounded tokens. By refining outputs and reinterpreting input tokens, the model effectively reduces false presumptions of visual presence in text input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various LVLMs. The study provides insights into improving the contextual relevancy and accuracy of LVLM responses by considering visual grounding in text interpretation and generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Vision-Language Models often misinterpret text inputs without visual evidence, leading to erroneous responses. VA neurons in the Feed-Forward Network signal visual absence, enabling the development of a detection module that classifies visually grounded tokens. By refining outputs based on detection results, the model mitigates false presumptions of visual presence in text input, enhancing the accuracy and contextual relevancy of LVLM responses. This approach shows promise for improving the performance of LVLMs in various applications. <div>
arXiv:2509.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons, that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models' tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its generality across various LVLMs.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to person re-identification that addresses the challenges of locating the target accurately and extracting fine-grained features. By incorporating both foreground and background information in a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline, the proposed framework leverages semantic alignment and adversarial learning strategies to enhance the discriminative power of the network. By aligning visual and textual features with similar semantics and penalizing similarity between foreground and background features, the model is able to suppress noisy background regions and focus on identity-relevant foreground cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and generality. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules, yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy. Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues. Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen lesion contours.

<div> Keywords: Conditional diffusion models, Multi-task scenarios, Ill-posed tasks, Dynamic conditions, Image processing

Summary: 
Conditional diffusion models have shown significant progress in image processing tasks. However, in multi-task scenarios, exploiting the correlation between tasks and dealing with ill-posed tasks with limited training data present challenges. To address these issues, a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm is proposed. This paradigm separates the diffusion and condition generation processes, allowing the diffusion model to operate without supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Dynamic conditions are introduced to adjust statistical characteristics gradually, embedding time-related information and facilitating network learning in multi-task scenarios. Analysis of the network's learning objectives and attention weights demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic conditions. By applying this paradigm to dehazing and visible-infrared fusion tasks, superior performance is achieved on public datasets. The code for the proposed framework is publicly available. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105 Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training data and 99.46% accuracy on test data. Comparisons with various state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

Summary: <br />
Handwritten characters pose challenges for classification due to their cursive and complex nature. In this study, an external classifier in conjunction with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was proposed to address this issue. The GAN generated fake handwritten character images, which were then used to augment the training data. By adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence score above a threshold with the discriminator network, the proposed model, ADA-GAN, exhibited robustness in classifying both cursive and complex characters. While the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreased with increasing character complexity, the ADA-GAN model remained effective in handling the challenging classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective for both cursive and complex characters.

Summary:<br />
This study addresses the challenges in detecting and modeling intracranial aneurysms by proposing a cross-domain feature-transfer approach. The approach utilizes latent geometric embeddings learned by the TRELLIS generative model from non-medical 3D datasets to enhance neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By incorporating TRELLIS surface features in place of traditional descriptors, the study improves the accuracy of tasks such as aneurysm classification, vessel segmentation, and blood-flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in accuracy, F1-score, and segmentation quality over existing methods, as well as a 15% reduction in simulation error. The study highlights the potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical tasks, offering promising avenues for improving the detection and analysis of intracranial aneurysms. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical tasks.

<div> Spoofing attacks, Face recognition systems, Backdoor poisoning attack, Deep learning, Anti-spoofing detection<br />
Summary:<br />
Face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks using user face photos. To prevent this, detecting whether an input image is live or spoofed is crucial. Most spoofing attack detection methods rely on deep learning but require a large amount of training data, making them susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks. In this study, a novel backdoor poisoning attack method is proposed to show the threat it poses to face anti-spoofing detection. This method allows certain spoofing attacks to evade detection by embedding features from a spoofed face image into a live face image without any visible changes. Experiments on public datasets confirm the effectiveness of this method, highlighting the need for improved security measures in face recognition systems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise, and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

<div> Keywords: time series change detection, deep learning, spatial change detection, Class Activation Mapping, CAIM-Net<br />
Summary: <br />
Time series change detection in ecosystem dynamics using remote sensing images is important for identifying changes in both area and moment. The proposed CAIM-Net model integrates change area and moment detection, ensuring consistency. The model consists of three main components: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. The model uses a lightweight encoder and boundary enhancement convolution to rapidly extract and amplify difference features. Coarse change moments are determined through spatiotemporal correlation analysis, followed by fine change moment extraction using a multiscale temporal Class Activation Mapping module. The inferred change moments are then used to identify change areas, leveraging the relationship between time series analysis and spatial change detection. <div>
arXiv:2509.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network, named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the change moment must have undergone a change.

<div> Keywords: Hallucinations, multimodal large language model, text-visual bias, co-occurrence bias, contrastive decoding framework

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models, identifying the root causes as the text-visual bias and co-occurrence bias. Traditional mitigation methods have been limited in their effectiveness due to a lack of understanding of the varying bias levels across different instances. The proposed solution involves estimating the influence of different token types (visual, prompt, previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. This estimation allows for the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework. The method effectively mitigates both biases without the need for additional resources such as fine-tuning or extra models. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on the LLaVA-QA90 dataset. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

<div> Keywords: hand-object interaction, pose estimation, deformable hand surface, GravityDB, semantic information

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach called Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) for simulating hand-object interactions. Existing methods often struggle with interpenetration or gaps in contact regions due to the complex geometry of hands and objects. The GravityDB method models interaction as an attraction-driven process, ensuring physically plausible interactions without interpenetration. It captures realistic hand deformations during interaction, improving the accuracy of pose estimation. Additionally, semantic information from textual descriptions is used to guide the construction of the gravitational field, leading to more meaningful interaction regions. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GravityDB in generating stable grasping and realistic hand-object interactions. <div>

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: MRI, brain progression, 3D modeling, diffusion model, temporal awareness

Summary:<br />
Generating realistic MRI images for accurate prediction of brain structural changes over time is crucial for clinicians. Current methods have limitations like not capturing the relationship between structural changes and time intervals for age-imbalanced datasets, only relying on scan interpolation, and using 2D slice-based architectures. To address these limitations, a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D) is proposed. It incorporates a Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) to guide the diffusion model for generating MRI volumes reflecting expected age differences. The model is trained bidirectionally to predict both forward and backward scans to improve temporal accuracy. Tested on the OASIS-3 dataset with validation on the NACC dataset, TADM-3D shows promising results in predicting brain progression accurately. The code for the model will be available upon acceptance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.

The article introduces two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss, aimed at preserving connectivity of output instances in biomedical segmentation tasks. These loss functions, integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks, enhance the continuity and length preservation of elongated structures in segmentation masks. The study discusses the importance of experiment design characteristics like downscaling and spacing correction in achieving continuous segmentation masks. Evaluation on a 3D light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments showcases the effectiveness of the proposed methods in reducing segmentation discontinuities, especially in regions with missing input signal.

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for biological applications.

Summary: Count2Density introduces a novel pipeline for crowd density estimation that reduces the need for fine-grained location-level annotations by utilizing count-level annotations. The approach leverages a Historical Map Bank to generate pseudo-density maps based on past predictions, reducing confirmation bias. The model incorporates an unsupervised saliency estimator and iterative updates to improve spatial priors. By sampling locations within crowd areas, the pipeline successfully retrieves spatial information from count-level annotations. Additionally, a self-supervised contrastive spatial regularizer enhances spatial awareness in the model. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to cross-domain adaptation methods and recent state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings, showcasing the effectiveness of Count2Density in accurately estimating crowd density and enabling precise subregion counting.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations, (i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks. Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and enabling accurate subregion counting.

The research focuses on the threat of poisoning attacks on military object detection systems. Limited research exists on this topic despite its severity. A custom dataset called MilCivVeh was created to investigate this threat. The study implemented a modified version of the BadDet attack to assess the vulnerability of military object detectors. The impact of the poisoning attack was found to require a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned for a positive attack success rate. Detection methods were tested, including specialized poisoning detection and anomaly detection methods, but were found lacking. A new patch detection method called AutoDetect, based on autoencoders, was introduced and showed promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples. Availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is deemed crucial for evaluating risks and opportunities in patch detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences. In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack: a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality. Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of 41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to 94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues. Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care, mental health, and human-centered AI.

<div> Keywords: fMRI, brain disorder diagnosis, multimodal feature fusion, text generation, deep learning<br />
Summary:<br />
The research introduces RTGMFF, a framework that combines automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain disorder diagnosis using fMRI data. The framework includes three components: ROI-driven fMRI text generation, a Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder, and an Adaptive semantic alignment module. The ROI-driven fMRI text generation condenses subject-specific information into reproducible text tokens. The Hybrid encoder captures frequency-domain structure and spatial dependencies using a cross-scale Transformer encoder. The Adaptive alignment module embeds ROI token sequences and visual features in a shared space to narrow the modality gap. Experimentation on ADHD-200 and ABIDE datasets demonstrates that RTGMFF outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving improved sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve. The code for RTGMFF is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new 3D medical diffusion model, SynBT, for generating high-quality breast tumors in contrast-enhanced MRI images. This model addresses the limitations of existing tumor synthesis methods when dealing with large spatial volumes like breast tumors in MRI with a large FOV. The method includes a patch-to-volume autoencoder to compress high-resolution MRIs into a compact latent space and a mask-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize realistic breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue. The proposed SynBT model showed an improved performance of 2-3% Dice Score in tumor segmentation tasks on a large public dataset. This suggests that the high-quality tumor synthesis method can enhance common segmentation models and aid in accurate tumor segmentation in MRI images. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images.

<div> PointAD+, 3D anomalies, hierarchical representation learning, anomaly semantics, ZS anomaly detection

Summary:
PointAD+ proposes a unified framework for detecting and segmenting 3D anomalies by incorporating both point- and pixel-level information. It introduces PointAD to represent anomalies through rendering pixel representations and PointAD+ to include spatial abnormality through explicit 3D representation. The framework incorporates geometry information and utilizes hierarchical representation learning with rendering and geometry prompts for anomaly detection. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment enhances interaction between rendering and geometry layers, leading to better anomaly learning. PointAD+ demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection on unseen objects with diverse class semantics, providing a comprehensive understanding of abnormality. The framework can also integrate RGB information for improved detection performance. Overall, PointAD+ offers a holistic approach to identifying and understanding 3D anomalies across a wide range of objects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Summary:
This paper explores the impact of incorporating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs). The study reveals that employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data leads to significant improvements in MLLM reasoning. Additionally, it is noted that MLLMs can further enhance their performance through a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage post-SFT. The research emphasizes the importance of an initial SFT phase with long CoT data as a crucial step in developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs. <div>

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework for enhancing brick-level segmentation of masonry structures in point clouds, which are commonly used for infrastructure monitoring. In low-light environments like masonry tunnels, high-resolution images are impractical, making point clouds a robust alternative. However, these point clouds are unstructured, sparse, and noisy, hampering fine-grained segmentation. InfraDiffusion addresses this challenge by converting point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and applying the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM) to improve visual clarity and geometric consistency. By incorporating the Segment Anything Model (SAM), InfraDiffusion significantly enhances brick-level segmentation in masonry bridge and tunnel datasets, showcasing its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets. The code and data are publicly available for further research and application. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images. However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight vision model.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images. Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept customization and highlights key challenges for future research.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Summary:
State-Space Models with Transfer State (SMTS) is proposed to tackle the challenges of dense video captioning, allowing for the processing of even longer video sequences while minimizing computational complexity. This model combines the benefits of SSMs with transfer states to sustain long contexts effectively. By enabling online processing of videos, SMTS eliminates the need to wait for the full video to be processed, making it suitable for generating captions on-the-fly. The approach scales efficiently with video lengths and achieves a 7x reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional methods. SMTS offers a promising solution for dense video captioning tasks by enhancing the scalability and computational efficiency of state-space models. 

<br /><br />Summary: State-Space Models with Transfer State addresses challenges in dense video captioning by effectively handling long video sequences, enabling online processing, and reducing computational complexity. <div>
arXiv:2509.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event. Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach, State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts, effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner, without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Summary: 
The proposed framework integrates EEG, image, and text data to decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. By incorporating text modality, semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content is enhanced.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image, and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content. With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by 2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for deployment on edge devices in practice.

<title>Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of mPLUG-Owl2 via Pixel-Level Visual Prompts for NR-IQA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks.

<title>OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03498</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

<title>Strefer: Empowering Video LLMs with Space-Time Referring and Reasoning via Synthetic Instruction Data</title>

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits, letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile, these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation

Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing, while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

Following the "Bitter Lesson"\cite{sutton2019bitterlesson} principle that emphasizes data scale over algorithmic novelty, we have publicly released two new datasets to bolster training data for both conventional \cite{Shen2024framework} and atypical mitoses \cite{shen_2025_16780587}. Besides, we implement up-to-date training methodologies for both track and reach a Track-1 F1-Score of 0.8407 on our test set, as well as a Track-2 balanced accuracy of 0.9107 for atypical mitotic cell classification.

Abstract: Automated detection and classification of mitotic figures especially distinguishing atypical from normal remain critical challenges in computational pathology. We present MitoDetect++, a unified deep learning pipeline designed for the MIDOG 2025 challenge, addressing both mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification. For detection (Track 1), we employ a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with EfficientNetV2-L as the backbone, enhanced with attention modules, and trained via combined segmentation losses. For classification (Track 2), we leverage the Virchow2 vision transformer, fine-tuned efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize resource consumption. To improve generalization and mitigate domain shifts, we integrate strong augmentations, focal loss, and group-aware stratified 5-fold cross-validation. At inference, we deploy test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost robustness. Our method achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.892 across validation domains, highlighting its clinical applicability and scalability across tasks.

Abstract: We tackle atypical versus normal mitosis classification in the MIDOG 2025 challenge using EfficientViT-L2, a hybrid CNN--ViT architecture optimized for accuracy and efficiency. A unified dataset of 13,938 nuclei from seven cancer types (MIDOG++ and AMi-Br) was used, with atypical mitoses comprising ~15. To assess domain generalization, we applied leave-one-cancer-type-out cross-validation with 5-fold ensembles, using stain-deconvolution for image augmentation. For challenge submissions, we trained an ensemble with the same 5-fold split but on all cancer types. In the preliminary evaluation phase, this model achieved balanced accuracy of 0.859, ROC AUC of 0.942, and raw accuracy of 0.85, demonstrating competitive and well-balanced performance across metrics.

Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. During training, we employ a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving a high balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.

Abstract: Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figures detection approach based on the YOLOv12 object detection architecture, achieving a $F_1$-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set of the MIDOG 2025 challenge, without relying on external data.

Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology, as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis. Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance. To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations, and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in mitotic figure analysis within computational pathology. In this paper, we present our approach to the Mitosis Domain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 Challenge, which consists of two distinct tasks, i.e., mitotic figure detection and atypical mitosis classification. For the mitotic figure detection task, we propose a two-stage detection-classification framework that first localizes candidate mitotic figures and subsequently refines the predictions using a dedicated classification module. For the atypical mitosis classification task, we employ an ensemble strategy that integrates predictions from multiple state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods across both tasks.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection in histopathology images remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across different scanners, staining protocols, and tissue types. This paper presents our approach for the MIDOG 2025 challenge Track 1, focusing on robust mitotic figure detection across diverse histological contexts. While we initially planned a two-stage approach combining high-recall detection with subsequent classification refinement, time constraints led us to focus on optimizing a single-stage detection pipeline. We employed RF-DETR (Roboflow Detection Transformer) with hard negative mining, trained on MIDOG++ dataset. On the preliminary test set, our method achieved an F1 score of 0.789 with a recall of 0.839 and precision of 0.746, demonstrating effective generalization across unseen domains. The proposed solution offers insights into the importance of training data balance and hard negative mining for addressing domain shift challenges in mitotic figure detection.

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs. 1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability. Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4 percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be reported upon challenge completion.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2, InceptionResNet-v2) for false positive reduction. Our best submission achieved F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive, highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This work provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of developing robust mitotic figure detection algorithms and emphasizes the importance of effective false positive suppression strategies.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection is a crucial task in computational pathology, as mitotic activity serves as a strong prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness. However, domain variability that arises from differences in scanners, tissue types, and staining protocols poses a major challenge to the robustness of automated detection methods. In this study, we introduce SDF-YOLO (Single Detect Focused YOLO), a lightweight yet domain-robust detection framework designed specifically for small, rare targets such as mitotic figures. The model builds on YOLOv11 with task-specific modifications, including a single detection head aligned with mitotic figure scale, coordinate attention to enhance positional sensitivity, and improved cross-channel feature mixing. Experiments were conducted on three datasets that span human and canine tumors: MIDOG ++, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT), and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC). When submitted to the preliminary test set for the MIDOG2025 challenge, SDF-YOLO achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.799, with a precision of 0.758, a recall of 0.775, an F1 score of 0.766, and an FROC-AUC of 5.793, demonstrating both competitive accuracy and computational efficiency. These results indicate that SDF-YOLO provides a reliable and efficient framework for robust mitotic figure detection across diverse domains.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge. Starting from a LoRA-based baseline, we found that visual prompt tuning (VPT) substantially improved generalization, and that further integrating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko stain normalization provided the best robustness. Our final submission achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results demonstrate that prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers an effective strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis, especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80 \pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.

Abstract: Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images remains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity, and the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols. The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we employed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a major reduction in precision. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors to advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN, which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases: we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.

<title>Uncertainty-aware Test-Time Training (UT$^3$) for Efficient On-the-fly Domain Adaptive Dense Regression</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision. However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$) that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model. Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction, supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably, our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

<title>Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics</title>

Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material, interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete, continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at generating precise object masks from input prompts but lacks semantic awareness, failing to associate its generated masks with specific object categories. To address this limitation, we propose U-SAM, a novel framework that imbibes semantic awareness into SAM, enabling it to generate targeted masks for user-specified object categories. Given only object class names as input from the user, U-SAM provides pixel-level semantic annotations for images without requiring any labeled/unlabeled samples from the test data distribution. Our approach leverages synthetically generated or web crawled images to accumulate semantic information about the desired object classes. We then learn a mapping function between SAM's mask embeddings and object class labels, effectively enhancing SAM with granularity-specific semantic recognition capabilities. As a result, users can obtain meaningful and targeted segmentation masks for specific objects they request, rather than generic and unlabeled masks. We evaluate U-SAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO-80, achieving significant mIoU improvements of +17.95% and +5.20%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. By transforming SAM into a semantically aware segmentation model, U-SAM offers a practical and flexible solution for pixel-level annotation across diverse and unseen domains in a resource-constrained environment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behavior and neural representations in vision tasks. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. What is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behavior? We highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgments, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via finetuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of human judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgments and more practically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: This work presents Spacecraft Pose Network v3 (SPNv3), a Neural Network (NN) for monocular pose estimation of a known, non-cooperative target spacecraft. SPNv3 is designed and trained to be computationally efficient while providing robustness to spaceborne images that have not been observed during offline training and validation on the ground. These characteristics are essential to deploying NNs on space-grade edge devices. They are achieved through careful NN design choices, and an extensive trade-off analysis reveals features such as data augmentation, transfer learning and vision transformer architecture as a few of those that contribute to simultaneously maximizing robustness and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that the final SPNv3 can achieve state-of-the-art pose accuracy on hardware-in-the-loop images from a robotic testbed while having trained exclusively on computer-generated synthetic images, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real imagery. At the same time, SPNv3 runs well above the update frequency of modern satellite navigation filters when tested on a representative graphical processing unit system with flight heritage. Overall, SPNv3 is an efficient, flight-ready NN model readily applicable to close-range rendezvous and proximity operations with target resident space objects.

<title>Domain Consistency Representation Learning for Lifelong Person Re-Identification</title>

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) exhibits a contradictory relationship between intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps when learning from continuous data. Intra-domain discrimination focuses on individual nuances (i.e., clothing type, accessories, etc.), while inter-domain gaps emphasize domain consistency. Achieving a trade-off between maximizing intra-domain discrimination and minimizing inter-domain gaps is a crucial challenge for improving LReID performance. Most existing methods strive to reduce inter-domain gaps through knowledge distillation to maintain domain consistency. However, they often ignore intra-domain discrimination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain consistency representation learning (DCR) model that explores global and attribute-wise representations as a bridge to balance intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps. At the intra-domain level, we explore the complementary relationship between global and attribute-wise representations to improve discrimination among similar identities. Excessive learning intra-domain discrimination can lead to catastrophic forgetting. We further develop an attribute-oriented anti-forgetting (AF) strategy that explores attribute-wise representations to enhance inter-domain consistency, and propose a knowledge consolidation (KC) strategy to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DCR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LReID methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DCR.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is at the core of many applications in computer graphics, vision, and robotics. Current state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators, trained on extensive datasets, generalize well but lack 3D consistency needed for many applications. In this paper, we combine the strength of those generalizing monocular depth estimation techniques with multi-view data by framing this as an analysis-by-synthesis optimization problem to lift and refine such relative depth maps to accurate error-free depth maps. After an initial global scale estimation through structure-from-motion point clouds, we further refine the depth map through optimization enforcing multi-view consistency via photometric and geometric losses with differentiable rendering of the meshed depth map. In a two-stage optimization, scaling is further refined first, and afterwards artifacts and errors in the depth map are corrected via nearby-view photometric supervision. Our evaluation shows that our method is able to generate detailed, high-quality, view consistent, accurate depth maps, also in challenging indoor scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view depth reconstruction approaches on such datasets.

<title>Learning a Neural Association Network for Self-supervised Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework to learn data association for multi-object tracking in a self-supervised manner. Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.

Abstract: Galaxy morphology analysis involves studying galaxies based on their shapes and structures. For such studies, fundamental tasks include identifying and classifying galaxies in astronomical images, as well as retrieving visually or structurally similar galaxies through similarity search. Existing methods either directly train domain-specific foundation models on large, annotated datasets or fine-tune vision foundation models on a smaller set of images. The former is effective but costly, while the latter is more resource-efficient but often yields lower accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce GalaxAlign, a multimodal approach inspired by how citizen scientists identify galaxies in astronomical images by following textual descriptions and matching schematic symbols. Specifically, GalaxAlign employs a tri-modal alignment framework to align three types of data during fine-tuning: (1) schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels for these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. By incorporating multimodal instructions, GalaxAlign eliminates the need for expensive pretraining and enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/RapidsAtHKUST/GalaxAlign.

<title>LumiNet: Latent Intrinsics Meets Diffusion Models for Indoor Scene Relighting</title>

Abstract: We introduce LumiNet, a novel architecture that leverages generative models and latent intrinsic representations for effective lighting transfer. Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning.
  Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.

<title>Towards a Universal Synthetic Video Detector: From Face or Background Manipulations to Fully AI-Generated Content</title>

Abstract: Existing DeepFake detection techniques primarily focus on facial manipulations, such as face-swapping or lip-syncing. However, advancements in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) generative models now allow fully AI-generated synthetic content and seamless background alterations, challenging face-centric detection methods and demanding more versatile approaches.
  To address this, we introduce the \underline{U}niversal \underline{N}etwork for \underline{I}dentifying \underline{T}ampered and synth\underline{E}tic videos (\texttt{UNITE}) model, which, unlike traditional detectors, captures full-frame manipulations. \texttt{UNITE} extends detection capabilities to scenarios without faces, non-human subjects, and complex background modifications. It leverages a transformer-based architecture that processes domain-agnostic features extracted from videos via the SigLIP-So400M foundation model. Given limited datasets encompassing both facial/background alterations and T2V/I2V content, we integrate task-irrelevant data alongside standard DeepFake datasets in training. We further mitigate the model's tendency to over-focus on faces by incorporating an attention-diversity (AD) loss, which promotes diverse spatial attention across video frames. Combining AD loss with cross-entropy improves detection performance across varied contexts. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that \texttt{UNITE} outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on datasets (in cross-data settings) featuring face/background manipulations and fully synthetic T2V/I2V videos, showcasing its adaptability and generalizable detection capabilities.

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual content enhances user experience by providing additional information. However, improperly positioned or designed virtual content can be detrimental to task performance, as it can impair users' ability to accurately interpret real-world information. In this paper we examine two types of task-detrimental virtual content: obstruction attacks, in which virtual content prevents users from seeing real-world objects, and information manipulation attacks, in which virtual content interferes with users' ability to accurately interpret real-world information. We provide a mathematical framework to characterize these attacks and create a custom open-source dataset for attack evaluation. To address these attacks, we introduce ViDDAR (Vision language model-based Task-Detrimental content Detector for Augmented Reality), a comprehensive full-reference system that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and advanced deep learning techniques to monitor and evaluate virtual content in AR environments, employing a user-edge-cloud architecture to balance performance with low latency. To the best of our knowledge, ViDDAR is the first system to employ VLMs for detecting task-detrimental content in AR settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ViDDAR effectively understands complex scenes and detects task-detrimental content, achieving up to 92.15% obstruction detection accuracy with a detection latency of 533 ms, and an 82.46% information manipulation content detection accuracy with a latency of 9.62 s.

Abstract: Multiple studies have performed next-day fire prediction using satellite imagery. Two main satellites are used to detect wildfires: MODIS and VIIRS. Both satellites provide fire mask products, called MOD14 and VNP14, respectively. Studies have used one or the other, but there has been no comparison between them to determine which might be more suitable for next-day fire prediction. In this paper, we first evaluate how well VIIRS and MODIS data can be used to forecast wildfire spread one day ahead. We find that the model using VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results. Interestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs significantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we discuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find that the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with reasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning tasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that MOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much better option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a significant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire detection model is possible for MODIS.

Abstract: Text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative models with great potential for solving inverse problems in imaging. However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Flow based generative models have charted an impressive path across multiple visual generation tasks by adhering to a simple principle: learning velocity representations of a linear interpolant. However, we observe that training velocity solely from the final layer output underutilizes the rich inter layer representations, potentially impeding model convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity representation through inter layer communication. DeepFlow partitions transformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a lightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent branches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer blocks. Powered by the improved deep supervision via the internal velocity alignment, DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent performance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared to previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance. DeepFlow also outperforms baselines in text to image generation tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on MSCOCO and zero shot GenEval.

Abstract: Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, while existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel, unified, and highly generalizable framework that goes beyond traditional binary classification, providing detailed, textual reasoning for its predictions. Distinct from conventional methods, TruthLens performs MLLM grounding.
  TruthLens uses a task-driven representation integration strategy that unites global semantic context from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with region-specific forensic cues through explicit cross-modal adaptation of a vision-only model. This enables nuanced, region-grounded reasoning for both face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, and supports fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"- capabilities beyond pretrained MLLMs alone. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens sets a new benchmark in both forensic interpretability and detection accuracy, generalizing to seen and unseen manipulations alike. By unifying high-level scene understanding with fine-grained region grounding, TruthLens delivers transparent DeepFake forensics, bridging a critical gap in the literature.

Abstract: Image geolocalization, in which an AI model traditionally predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image, is a challenging task with many downstream applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge beyond the GPS coordinates; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In recent days, with the tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) -- proprietary and open-source -- researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, such as geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In this work, we propose solving this problem by introducing a conversational model, GAEA, that provides information regarding the location of an image as the user requires. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists. Thus, we propose GAEA-1.4M, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 800k images and approximately 1.4M question-answer pairs, constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark, GAEA-Bench, comprising 3.5k image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision, by 18.2% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o, by 7.2%. Our dataset, model and codes are available.

Abstract: This paper introduces the class of grey-scale image stack operators as those that (a) map binary-images into binary-images and (b) commute on average with cross-sectioning. Equivalently, stack operators are 1-Lipchitz extensions of set operators which can be represented by applying a characteristic set operator to the cross-sections of the image and adding. In particular, they are a generalisation of stack filters, for which the characteristic set operators are increasing. Our main result is that stack operators inherit lattice properties of the characteristic set operators. We focus on the case of translation-invariant and locally defined stack operators and show the main result by deducing the characteristic function, kernel, and basis representation of stack operators. The results of this paper have implications on the design of image operators, since imply that to solve some grey-scale image processing problems it is enough to design an operator for performing the desired transformation on binary images, and then considering its extension given by a stack operator. We leave many topics for future research regarding the machine learning of stack operators and the characterisation of the image processing problems that can be solved by them.

Abstract: Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on multimodal wildfire social media data, which, although existing in current datasets, is currently underrepresented in Canadian contexts. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across twelve key themes. We evaluate zero-shot vision-language models on this dataset and compare their results with those of custom-trained and baseline classifiers. We show that while baseline methods and zero-shot prompting offer quick deployment, custom-trained models outperform them when labelled data is available. Our best-performing custom model reaches 84.48% f-score, outperforming VLMs and baseline classifiers. We also demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires, through the collection and analysis of a large unlabeled dataset. Our dataset facilitates future research in wildfire response, and our findings highlight the importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

Abstract: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data, particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet, significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography, BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring subglacial topography.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse, and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/LD-RPS.

<title>Enhancing Diffusion Model Stability for Image Restoration via Gradient Management</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is available at https://github.com/74587887/SPGD.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios.

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows, where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

Abstract: Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images. PadChest-GR can be downloaded under request from https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest-gr/

Abstract: The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Inspired by the Well-initialized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (WLTH), which provides suboptimal fine-tuning solutions, we propose a novel fully fine-tuned continual learning (CL) method referred to as Soft-TransFormers (Soft-TF). Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of low-resolution images, particularly for applications such as security and surveillance, where accurate license plate recognition is crucial. This study proposes a novel framework that combines pixel-based loss with embedding similarity learning to address the unique challenges of license plate super-resolution (LPSR). The introduced pixel and embedding consistency loss (PECL) integrates a Siamese network and applies contrastive loss to force embedding similarities to improve perceptual and structural fidelity. By effectively balancing pixel-wise accuracy with embedding-level consistency, the framework achieves superior alignment of fine-grained features between high-resolution (HR) and super-resolved (SR) license plates. Extensive experiments on the CCPD and PKU dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. These results highlight the potential of embedding similarity learning to advance both perceptual quality and task-specific performance in extreme super-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity images of the night sky from blurred observations is a fundamental problem in astronomy, where traditional methods typically fall short. In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.

Abstract: Generalizable dexterous grasping with suitable grasp types is a fundamental skill for intelligent robots. Developing such skills requires a large-scale and high-quality dataset that covers numerous grasp types (i.e., at least those categorized by the GRASP taxonomy), but collecting such data is extremely challenging. Existing automatic grasp synthesis methods are often limited to specific grasp types or object categories, hindering scalability. This work proposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich, penetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object, and articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each hand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem with two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then locally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the synthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows the hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object. Those validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate future synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our algorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps, covering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy. Finally, we train a type-conditional generative model that successfully performs the desired grasp type from single-view object point clouds, achieving an 82.3% success rate in real-world experiments.

Abstract: The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their algorithms, e.g., object detection.

<title>FastCache: Fast Caching for Diffusion Transformer Through Learnable Linear Approximation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

<title>Real-Time Per-Garment Virtual Try-On with Temporal Consistency for Loose-Fitting Garments</title>

Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address the first limitation, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. To address the second limitation, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework.

<title>Multimodal Medical Image Binding via Shared Text Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically, based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text, M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

arXiv:2507.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is highly challenging to register large-scale, heterogeneous SAR and optical images, particularly across platforms, due to significant geometric, radiometric, and temporal differences, which most existing methods struggle to address. To overcome these challenges, we propose Grid-Reg, a grid-based multimodal registration framework comprising a domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric Learning Network (HSCMLNet), and a grid-based solver (Grid-Solver) for transformation parameter estimation. In heterogeneous imagery with large modality gaps and geometric differences, obtaining accurate correspondences is inherently difficult. To robustly measure similarity between gridded patches, HSCMLNet integrates a hybrid Siamese module with a correlation metric learning module (CMLModule) based on equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs), together with a manifold consistency loss to promote modality-invariant, discriminative feature learning. The Grid-Solver estimates transformation parameters by minimizing a global grid matching loss through a progressive dual-loop search strategy to reliably find patch correspondences across entire images. Furthermore, we curate a challenging benchmark dataset for SAR-to-optical registration using real-world UAV MiniSAR data and Google Earth optical imagery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are being increasingly utilized in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) element structuring to process user instructions based on screen contents. However, the challenge lies in their ability to precisely generate UI element coordinates due to the lack of semantic representation for numerical UI coordinates in language spaces. To overcome this limitation, an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm is introduced. This approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment training data, focusing on proximity to ground truth coordinates. By fine-tuning MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, exposure bias problems inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation are mitigated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the IAML training approach compared to traditional paradigms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.

Summary: 
CoViPAL is a novel approach for efficient and effective pruning of redundant visual tokens in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). By utilizing a lightweight Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM), CoViPAL predicts and removes unnecessary vision tokens before they are processed by the model, resulting in improved computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The method operates independently of LVLM architecture, making it adaptable to various models. CoViPAL surpasses both training-free and training-based pruning methods in terms of performance under equal token budgets. By leveraging contextual signals, CoViPAL demonstrates the ability to identify and eliminate redundant visual information even in shallow layers, where traditional methods struggle due to lack of contextual information. Overall, CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing inference efficiency in LVLMs by reducing computational costs and memory overhead associated with processing visual inputs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

<div> Keywords: clinical decision-making, multimodal retriever, LVLM, medical diagnosis, visual information retrieval

Summary:
In this paper, the authors propose a model that combines a multimodal retriever with a LVLM for medical diagnosis, optimizing them jointly to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Unlike standard approaches, this model propagates error signals down to the retriever, resulting in competitive results with medically-pretrained models for clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. The analysis shows that different top retrieved images can lead to different predictions for the same target, presenting a challenge for all models. The joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these challenging cases over standard methods, although there is still a performance gap from the oracle diagnosis. Future methods could potentially improve the model further, as there is room for enhancement in closing the performance gap. The code for the model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology) for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator. Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains.

EventTracer is introduced as a path tracing-based rendering pipeline for simulating high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes efficiently and in a physics-aware manner. The pipeline utilizes low sample-per-pixel path tracing to speed up the rendering process and a lightweight event spiking network to denoise RGB videos into realistic event sequences. The network is equipped with a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired spiking unit and trained with a bidirectional earth mover distance loss to capture physical properties of event streams. EventTracer runs at a speed of approximately 4 minutes per second of 720p video and accurately models spatiotemporal information. It outperforms existing event simulators in capturing scene details and similarity to real-world event data, making it a promising tool for generating large-scale event-RGB datasets cost-effectively. This advancement bridges the gap between simulation and reality in event-based vision research, benefiting fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and VR/AR applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300 FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous driving, and VRAR.

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity, validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning. Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures.

<div> keywords: image dehazing, high-resolution imagery, global features generator, local features enhancer, Uformer architecture

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework, the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC), to enhance image dehazing for high-resolution imagery. The framework consists of the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE), which work together to combine global contextual information with local details effectively. By incorporating SGLC into the Uformer architecture, the performance of dehazing models on high-resolution datasets significantly improves in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This approach allows for the refinement of preliminary dehazed outputs by capturing both global appearance and local structure, enhancing visual fidelity in large-scale environments. The SGLC design is model-agnostic, making it versatile for integration with various dehazing networks, providing a comprehensive solution for addressing atmospheric haze in high-resolution imagery. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components: the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

Summary: 
This study introduces a large-scale self-supervised model for detecting kidney abnormalities in drug safety assessment studies. Traditional methods are time-consuming and costly, necessitating the examination of numerous whole-slide images to identify potential toxic effects. The study utilizes features from the UNI foundation model but initially finds that a k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance level. However, a self-supervised approach applied to the same features yields better results, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. This innovative model shows promise in ruling out normal slides, potentially reducing costs and time in drug development processes. Further development and refinement could enhance the model's performance and practical utility in preclinical drug development. <br /><br /> Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries. Source code is available at: https://github.com/faixan-khan/cletir

Summary:<br /><br />
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, they often unintentionally reveal sensitive biometric attributes like race and gender, posing privacy concerns. To address this issue, the PRISM benchmark evaluates MLLMs on refusing biometric queries and detecting implicit biometric leakage while maintaining accuracy. An audit of LLaVA datasets found extensive biometric leakage, leading to the creation of the Safe-LLaVA dataset, which removes biometric information for privacy preservation. Evaluations on PRISM showed biometric leaks across MLLMs, underscoring privacy violations. Fine-tuning a model on Safe-LLaVA significantly reduced biometric leakage. Safe-LLaVA and PRISM establish a new standard for privacy-centric MLLM development and evaluation. The datasets and codes are publicly available, promoting transparent and ethical MLLM research. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

This study reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$ extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$ algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the $FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

In this work, we present a language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1 consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the limitations of classical pipelines.

<div> Keywords: transductive learning, few-shot learning, vision-language models, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, information-theoretic concepts

Summary:<br /><br />
Transductive few-shot learning in vision-language models is still an emerging field, with limited existing methods. This study introduces a novel approach called Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) that incorporates information-theoretic concepts and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The LIMO method includes three key components: mutual information between vision inputs and textual class descriptions, KL divergence to penalize deviation from text-driven predictions, and a standard cross-entropy loss. By challenging traditional fine-tuning practices and exploring PEFT strategies, the study demonstrates significant performance improvements over recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods and inductive approaches. The findings highlight the potential of adapting a subset of model parameters in transductive few-shot learning scenarios. The comprehensive evaluations and publicly available code contribute to advancing the field of vision-language models in few-shot learning scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is publicly available at:\[ \href{https://github.com/ghassenbaklouti/LIMO}{\text{here}} \]

<div> Keywords: domain generalization, computational histopathology, nuclear morphology, supervised contrastive learning, resilient representations

Summary:
Domain generalization in computational histopathology is challenging due to variations in whole slide images (WSIs) across institutions. Pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues for diagnosis, such as nuclear atypia and spatial organization. In this study, MorphGen, a method integrating images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks, is proposed for learning resilient cancer representations. By aligning latent representations of images and masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features over staining artifacts. Incorporating stochastic weight averaging (SWA) enhances out-of-distribution robustness. Attention map analyses reveal that MorphGen focuses on nuclear morphology and spatial organization for classification. The method demonstrates resilience to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, addressing vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology. Overall, MorphGen enhances domain generalization in computational histopathology by emphasizing nuclear morphology and spatial organization for robust cancer representation.

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

<div> Keywords: Large Multimodal Models, token pruning, visual tokens, mutual information, computational efficiency

Summary:
Token pruning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is essential for reducing computational and memory costs during inference. This paper proposes a novel approach to token pruning that focuses exclusively on visual tokens. By analyzing the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens, the proposed method aims to preserve cross-modal alignment and intra-modal diversity. The strategy involves removing visually misaligned tokens based on mutual information and pruning redundant visual tokens by maximizing expected pairwise distances in the embedding space. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains strong performance while significantly reducing the number of tokens in models like LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a substantial improvement in inference speed by 56.7%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed visual token pruning strategy in enhancing the efficiency of Large Multimodal Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks, particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is available at https://github.com/human-analysis/CryptoFace.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach, LUT-Fuse, for extremely fast infrared and visible image fusion through distillation to learnable lookup tables. The method utilizes a look-up table structure with low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding, suitable for multi-modal fusion. Instead of traditional quantization methods, an efficient LUT distillation strategy is proposed due to the lack of ground truth in multi-modal image fusion. By integrating the multi-modal fusion network into the MM-LUT model, the approach achieves high operational speed, requiring less time compared to current lightweight fusion algorithms. The effectiveness, reliability, and stability of the fusion approach are validated through extensive experiments. Code for the method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/zyb5/LUT-Fuse.

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is available at https://github.com/zyb5/LUT-Fuse.

<div> Keywords: Single Domain Generalization, Target-Oriented, Spectral Target Alignment, Visual-Language Models, Feature-space Mixup

Summary: 
Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG) addresses the challenge of model generalization under distribution shifts by leveraging textual descriptions of the target domain. The proposed Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR) module uses visual-language models to inject target semantics into source features, aligning them with the deployment domain. STAR recenters image features using a target-anchored subspace derived from the target description and employs spectral projection to retain target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Vision-language distillation aligns backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry, enhancing generalization. Feature-space Mixup ensures smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superior performance, highlighting the importance of leveraging textual metadata for robust model deployment in unseen environments.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization (SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority. This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.

<div> Keywords: hyperspectral image denoising, low-rank representation, U-Net architecture, singular value thresholding, iterative refinement

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) for hyperspectral image denoising. ILRNet combines model-driven and data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module within a U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain and uses singular value thresholding for noise reduction. The parameter related to the thresholding algorithm is adaptively learned from the data, allowing for flexible capture of low-rankness in different scenarios. ILRNet also includes an iterative refinement process that progressively enhances denoised images while preserving details. Experimental results show that ILRNet outperforms existing methods in synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace, which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details. This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data, allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details. Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

Summary:
Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models is a persistent challenge, with existing methods often addressing omissions without considering the causes of fabrication hallucinations. This work argues that omission hallucinations stem from mapping visual features to linguistic expressions with insufficient confidence, while fabrication hallucinations result from statistical biases in the training corpus. The proposed Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field framework elucidates how models infer object presence or absence through visual evidence. The Visual Potential Field Calibration method successfully mitigates omission hallucinations without increasing fabrication hallucinations, addressing a critical oversight in current research and paving the way for more balanced hallucination mitigation strategies. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances, yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods, based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications. In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination mitigation strategies.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM (\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research. \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper may contain examples of offensive or harmful text and images.}

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However, due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

NoiseCutMix is a novel data augmentation method that combines the concepts of CutMix and diffusion models to generate natural and high-resolution images. By partially combining the estimated noise from different classes, NoiseCutMix creates diverse augmented data without unnatural boundaries.

arXiv:2509.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods, UDAKD and FSKD, for semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data in autonomous driving. By leveraging spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs, pretrained 2D image models are applied to unlabeled 2D data to align 3D networks with 2D networks without the need for 3D annotations. The focus is on preserving modality-general information while disregarding modality-specific details through self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over existing approaches in the field. <div>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.

Summary:<br />
A new paradigm named NAME is proposed for narrative inquiry, aiming to simplify the process of transforming research documents into coherent story images. The proposed approach includes an actor location and shape module for image generation and robust evaluation metrics to measure perceptual quality and narrative consistency. The method significantly outperforms baseline models, reducing the FID score with minimal data usage. For example, with only 0.96% of the data, the FID score decreased from 195 to 152. The model also achieves a high score on a new evaluation metric introduced. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize narrative analysis by improving efficiency and participant satisfaction in the narrative-making process. <div>

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too, are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96% yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes, our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<br />Summary: <br /> 
The paper introduces HERO-VQL, a method for egocentric visual query localization. It addresses challenges such as viewpoint changes and occlusions in egocentric videos. HERO-VQL uses Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) for refined attention and Egocentric Augmentation (EgoACT) for diverse query training. TAG leverages high-level context and principal component score maps for localization. EgoACT enhances query diversity by replacing queries with corresponding objects and simulating viewpoint changes. A Consistency Training (CT) loss enforces stable localization across different scenarios. Experiment results on VQ2D dataset show HERO-VQL outperforms baselines in handling egocentric challenges efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2509.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video. Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization (HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges, significantly outperforming baselines.

Summary:
The study introduces a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM) for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. DCDM freezes the weights of a pre-trained diffusion model and adds a double-constraint controller, reducing the number of trainable parameters and enhancing reconstruction flexibility. The Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC) work together to refine the pre-trained model, extract information from low-dose images, and control the reconstruction process. DCDM outperforms existing methods on known dose reduction factors and generalizes well to unknown scenarios, even at ultra-low dose levels. Experimental results on public and clinical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DCDM for reducing patient radiation exposure and improving imaging quality in PET reconstruction. <div>
arXiv:2509.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility. Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model, ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel deep learning model, DAOVI, for omnidirectional video inpainting to remove unwanted objects while maintaining spatial and temporal consistency. DAOVI incorporates a module to assess temporal motion information considering geodesic distance and a depth-aware feature propagation module to address geometric distortion in omnidirectional videos. The proposed method surpasses existing techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2509.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency. Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting, called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for reconstructing human avatars from monocular videos. Existing techniques face challenges in capturing dynamic details and generating plausible details from novel viewpoints. The proposed approach leverages the Human4DiT video generative model to generate human motions from alternative perspectives, enriching details in unseen regions and mitigating artifacts. Two strategies are introduced to enhance video generation: injecting physical identity for consistent motion reproduction and using a patch-based denoising algorithm for higher-resolution outputs with finer details. Experimental results demonstrate that the method surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and validates the effectiveness of the strategies. <div>

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.

Summary:
LightVLM introduces a method to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) during both encoding and decoding stages without the need for additional training. By utilizing pyramid token merging during encoding, it reduces the number of tokens from different layers to improve efficiency. Moreover, it enhances decoding speed by implementing KV Cache compression, removing unnecessary caches and increasing network throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLM maintains high performance with significantly fewer image tokens, improving network throughput by 2.02 times and reducing prefilling time by 3.65 times. It enables larger models to infer faster than smaller ones and significantly reduces inference time for generating long text sequences by 3.21 times, outperforming existing methods in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput. Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B), hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by 3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Summary:<br />
Multiple instance learning (MIL) is widely used in computational pathology for feature extraction from whole slide images (WSIs). Traditional attention-based MIL methods excel at identifying key patches but may overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models offer interaction modeling but at a high computational cost and risk of overfitting. State space models (SSMs) provide linear complexity but disrupt histological meaning when shuffling patch order. In this study, a novel approach called SemaMIL is introduced, combining Semantic Reordering (SR) for organizing patches based on semantic similarity and a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) for enhancing global modeling. SemaMIL outperforms existing methods in accuracy, requiring fewer floating-point operations and parameters. Tested on four WSI subtype datasets, SemaMIL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in computational pathology applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) algorithm to address label ambiguity in age estimation tasks. SA-LDL recognizes the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages by leveraging stage-wise patterns observed in embedding similarities. By integrating stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and a weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively captures the complex nature of label ambiguity, improving the accuracy and robustness of age estimation. Experimental results on the MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets show that SA-LDL achieves competitive performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 1.74 and 2.15, respectively. The proposed method offers a novel approach to handling label ambiguity in age estimation tasks, providing a new perspective on how to improve the performance of age estimation algorithms.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid, progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The source code of EOIR will be publicly available on https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

The game requires players to precisely control jumping force based on current position and target platform distance, involving multiple cognitive aspects including spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning. It illustrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the Jump-Jump game, where the player character (red circle) must jump across platforms with appropriate force to maximize score.

<div> benchmark, multimodal reward models, video understanding, evaluation, AI-assisted data pipeline

Summary:
Multimodal reward models (MRMs) are essential for training and evaluating Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain lack diversity and comprehensive evaluation dimensions. To address this, VideoRewardBench is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark covering perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety aspects of video understanding. A high-quality preference dataset is curated, including annotated samples with video-text prompts and responses. Evaluation across 28 MRMs reveals insights such as the limitations of RL training, benefits of inference-time scaling, and varying effects of input video frame count on MRMs. The top-performing models achieve around 57% accuracy, highlighting the challenges in developing effective MRMs for video understanding. VideoRewardBench offers a valuable resource for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training, inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii) except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Summary:<br />

- STVH captures spatiotemporal evolution on group visual features and positional features to improve video retrieval accuracy.<br />
- To handle the varying requirements of activity and visual features in video retrieval, M-STVH is proposed as an enhanced version of STVH.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

<div> Style gap, Ultrasound images, Image-to-image translation, Token-driven, Downstream tasks

Summary:
TRUST proposes a token-driven dual-stream framework for unpaired image-to-image translation (UI2I) to address the style gap in ultrasound images acquired from different devices. The framework aims to transfer images from a source domain to a target domain while preserving source content and transferring the common style of the target domain. It includes a Token-dRiven (TR) module that selects suitable target tokens for each source token and identifies optimal target tokens for downstream models using a behavior mirror loss. Auxiliary prompts are injected into the source encoder to match content representation with downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets show that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in visual quality and downstream task performance. <div>

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles, resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications. However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence as a Service, Black-Box Distillation, ATtention-Guided sCaler, DINOv2, API model

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of training local models using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or logits, a common constraint with AIaaS. A new setting called Black-Box Distillation (B2D) is introduced to enable local model adaptation under realistic constraints. The ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) method is proposed to address the challenge of open-vocabulary models having sensitivity to input resolution, known as the "curse of resolution." ATGC leverages DINOv2 attention maps to select optimal scales for black-box model inference and uses entropy to identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, resulting in effective distillation. Experiments show significant improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets while only requiring one-hot API predictions. The code for ATGC is available on GitHub at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC. <div>

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution". Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Summary:
In the study, the authors address the challenge of class-incremental semantic segmentation, focusing on catastrophic semantic entanglement. They propose a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD) to tackle Prototype-Feature Entanglement and Background-Increment Entanglement. The framework utilizes pre-trained visual-language models to guide the autonomous disentanglement of features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, the model bridges the capability gap between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC and ADE20k datasets, especially in multi-step scenarios. The approach shows promising results in class-incremental semantic segmentation tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.

Summary:
BrainFM is a new modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging. It is designed to address the challenges of generalization in uncalibrated modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The model utilizes a "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth" mix-up training strategy to improve resilience to variations in image appearance. BrainFM can be applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image synthesis, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance estimation, bias field estimation, and registration. Evaluation on eleven public datasets shows the model's robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. The code for BrainFM is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging. With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth" mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities.

Summary:
Object detection in challenging visual domains, like vehicle damage assessment, is difficult even for human experts. While DiffusionDet has improved this task using conditional denoising diffusion, it still faces limitations in context-dependent scenarios. To overcome this, Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) is introduced, incorporating global scene context with local proposal features using cross-attention mechanisms. By creating a separate encoder to capture environmental information, each object proposal can now access scene-level understanding. This framework enhances generative detection by allowing object proposals to consider comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results on the CarDD benchmark show that this approach outperforms existing models, setting new benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework, DGL-RSIS, for remote sensing segmentation that leverages vision language models. It addresses challenges in transferring VLMs to RS datasets by decoupling visual and textual inputs. The framework includes a Global-Local Decoupling module that separates text inputs into local class nouns and global modifiers, and image inputs into class-agnostic mask proposals. Visual and textual features are aligned at the local scale through context-aware cropping to enrich text inputs with RS-specific knowledge. The framework supports open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by matching enhanced text features with visual features guided by masks. At the global scale, a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module refines Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into mask-level segmentation output for accurate alignment across global and local dimensions, supporting referring expression segmentation. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

arXiv:2509.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels, capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model, crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

arXiv:2509.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog, snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data. Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy, which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.

<title>CSFMamba: Cross State Fusion Mamba Operator for Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result, modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization, but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition. Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release our code and model checkpoints.

<title>Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets (rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data.

<title>Enhancing Fairness in Skin Lesion Classification for Medical Diagnosis Using Prune Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

<title>Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/vdkhoi20/EVENT-Retriever.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks: image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval. Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical settings.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views.

<title>No More Sibling Rivalry: Debiasing Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI) detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline. To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes. Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed, existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LLiDaBao/AAGLSD.

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues, however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI, particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy, combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP) masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics. Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width, and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks. This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

<title>Satellite Image Utilization for Dehazing with Swin Transformer-Hybrid U-Net and Watershed loss</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00835</link>

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however, atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically, on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse remote sensing applications.

<title>Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

<title>Quantization Meets OOD: Generalizable Quantization-aware Training from a Flatness Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data, while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method, FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.

<title>Pose as Clinical Prior: Learning Dual Representations for Scoliosis Screening</title>

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.

arXiv:2509.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times, which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this, we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components, DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

<title>Seeing More, Saying More: Lightweight Language Experts are Dynamic Video Token Compressors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00969</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more) elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

<title>Towards Integrating Multi-Spectral Imaging with Gaussian Splatting</title>

arXiv:2509.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery (red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same, regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2) Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized, optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization, offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

<title>Weather-Dependent Variations in Driver Gaze Behavior: A Case Study in Rainy Conditions</title>

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts. While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%, sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5 frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this area.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants. More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images, especially the unseen ones.

<title>A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality</title>

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&amp;E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields, restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies, we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation. Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced, which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light, underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative (FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream auxiliary trainability.

<title>GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation</title>

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at $\href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}$.

<title>MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames. In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video MLLMs.

<title>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

<title>SegAssess: Panoramic quality mapping for robust and transferable unsupervised segmentation assessment</title>

arXiv:2509.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth. Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF) module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability. Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code is available at https://github.com/Yangbn97/SegAssess.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images. PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space, leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here: https://endo-gede.netlify.app/.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between Hematoxylin and Eosin H&amp;E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving H&amp;E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that bridges H&amp;E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning: We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively achieves superior performance in preserving H&amp;E staining details and virtual staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables, formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents. Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents, then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at https://github.com/Tencent/POINTS-Reader.

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions. Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator, significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding. Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

While RT-DETRv2 represents an important advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2 works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands. However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model.

<title>Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views</title>

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain. In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich, factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2 embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1 dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image understanding in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure, especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1, respectively.

<title>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Ordinary Differential Equations over Time Intervals</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01299</link>

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently, existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations. However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain adaptability of FSS-TIs.

<title>Guided Model-based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Resource-Efficient Automotive scene Segmentation</title>

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest. The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de- veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network. Addition- ally, we suggest potential future directions for further enhanc- ing the effectiveness of the model.

<title>Street-Level Geolocalization Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

<title>AgroSense: An Integrated Deep Learning System for Crop Recommendation via Soil Image Analysis and Nutrient Profiling</title>

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000 soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%, a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32 and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet, current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including 2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality. The code is available at https://github.com/Andyplus1/IPT2V.git.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras. In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset, augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust 24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/lwCVer/U3D_Toolkit.

<title>Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2) partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

<title>RibPull: Implicit Occupancy Fields and Medial Axis Extraction for CT Ribcage Scans</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations. We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon publication.

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics, and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<title>MILO: A Lightweight Perceptual Quality Metric for Image and Latent-Space Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score) supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion, enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration, while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue, existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges, challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model, our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight, Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game, along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated content. The dataset and code are available at https://ipcv.github.io/SoccerHigh/.

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent. Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations. Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization. Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data, however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency.

<title>PointSlice: Accurate and Efficient Slice-Based Representation for 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01487</link>

arXiv:2509.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network (SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is 1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP. On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders, ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency, establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module, to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps. Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder, utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets, respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods: positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}), which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology, these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework. By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443 and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally, HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly, the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient, high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks. https://cyqii.github.io/O-DisCo-Edit.github.io/

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to 57%

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

<title>OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems. While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO, designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and 33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2, acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images, TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches. Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition. To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB), where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets, including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.

<title>Latent Gene Diffusion for Spatial Transcriptomics Completion</title>

arXiv:2509.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion, with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space. Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of its isolated components.

<title>Enabling Federated Object Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles: A Deployment-Oriented Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL), by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions. Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware, and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development. Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment. Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to 0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training, significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance, the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures. However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge, our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

<title>Towards Interpretable Geo-localization: a Concept-Aware Global Image-GPS Alignment Framework</title>

arXiv:2509.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference. To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based, backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE, BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures, including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of more interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows, they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality.

<title>Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant Behavior in Low-Resource Care Settings</title>

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality, disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error, impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel, noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures (e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68% reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained environments.

This simple yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

<title>ContextFusion and Bootstrap: An Effective Approach to Improve Slot Attention-Based Object-Centric Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02032</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch, both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models. In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

<title>A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data. Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model, presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies, such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline} Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios. Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2 output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of 500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations, employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of 0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold. Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96 and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97), and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the size and variability of training data. However, the potential of diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion; including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.

Abstract: This paper explores the automated analysis of palmar features using machine learning techniques. We present a computer vision pipeline that extracts key characteristics from palm images, such as principal line structures, texture, and shape metrics. These features are used to train predictive models on a novel dataset curated from annotated palm images. Our approach moves beyond traditional subjective interpretation by providing a data-driven, quantitative framework for studying the correlations between palmar morphology and externally validated traits or conditions. The methodology demonstrates feasibility for applications in digital anthropometry and personalized user analytics, with potential for deployment on mobile platforms. Results indicate that machine learning models can identify complex patterns in palm data, opening avenues for research that intersects cultural practices with computational analysis.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network (FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness.

<title>DSGC-Net: A Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Crowd Counting via Feature Correlation Mining</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships, which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers, respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor, designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly available.

<title>Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351</link>

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However, most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object. For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1.

<title>Why Do MLLMs Struggle with Spatial Understanding? A Systematic Analysis from Data to Architecture</title>

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view, and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding. These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling and architectural tuning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ricklisz/MedDINOv3.

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And 2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper, we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for further study.

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges, this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene perception by combining complementary information from different modalities. Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities. Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing techniques.

<title>Towards High-Fidelity, Identity-Preserving Real-Time Makeup Transfer: Decoupling Style Generation</title>

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore, current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system, influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers), pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production, serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production. Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA, a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and general large 3D generative models.Our approach employs a two-stage training strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space. TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human representation.Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective evaluation.

<title>Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488</link>

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs), arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances, but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE), a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally, our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention. These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

<title>Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse, suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework (MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating, corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating, respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion, our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed, restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency. Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models, underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied, post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest performance with minimal inference time.

Abstract: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap, we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that the effectiveness of the system in practice.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk. Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and labor efficiency.

<title>Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation for Neural Network Quantization</title>

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their full-precision counterparts.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations.

Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts: scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust, scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex, language-based commands.

Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Abstract: Free-roaming dollies enhance filmmaking with dynamic movement, but challenges in automated camera control remain unresolved. Our study advances this field by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automate dolly-in shots using free-roaming ground-based filming robots, overcoming traditional control hurdles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combined control for precise film tasks by comparing it to independent control strategies. Our robust RL pipeline surpasses traditional Proportional-Derivative controller performance in simulation and proves its efficacy in real-world tests on a modified ROSBot 2.0 platform equipped with a camera turret. This validates our approach's practicality and sets the stage for further research in complex filming scenarios, contributing significantly to the fusion of technology with cinematic creativity. This work presents a leap forward in the field and opens new avenues for research and development, effectively bridging the gap between technological advancement and creative filmmaking.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments. All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time. Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg/tree/autoPET.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks, significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms, ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis, and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks, offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of generative models.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset) presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything) have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g., Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition. Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements (PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB. Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for error-resilient image and vision processing applications.

<title>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

<title>Towards Early Detection: AI-Based Five-Year Forecasting of Breast Cancer Risk Using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Imaging</title>

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT. Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients, we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

<title>GS-TG: 3D Gaussian Splatting Accelerator with Tile Grouping for Reducing Redundant Sorting while Preserving Rasterization Efficiency</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions. In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction. External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable, externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and semantics of temporal datasets.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

<title>VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively, recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL), encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related work.

However, these editions did not capture all aspects of the registration problem, particularly in terms of modality diversity and task complexity. To address these limitations, the 2024 edition introduces three new tasks, including large-scale multi-modal registration and unsupervised inter-subject brain registration, as well as the first microscopy-focused benchmark within Learn2Reg. The new datasets also inspired new method developments, including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment and instance optimisation.

Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced, combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count, fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters (i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic screening of PD.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning (CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting, they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism, both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently, task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

<title>Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation</title>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the object-relative state estimation task.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings, assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments. In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions, improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups. Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked robust and practical methods.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets, scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.

<title>Scale, Don't Fine-tune: Guiding Multimodal LLMs for Efficient Visual Place Recognition at Test-Time</title>

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs. The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$ computational efficiency gains.

<title>GRMM: Real-Time High-Fidelity Gaussian Morphable Head Model with Learned Residuals</title>

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism. Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast, high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry, expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters (e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering. To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

<title>Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair Generation</title>

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes. To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class \mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme regimes.

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection, validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient large-scale image analysis.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids, neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency, and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications, facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/isl-org/unifi3d.

<title>Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots</title>

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).

Abstract: The recent advance in multi-camera 3D object detection is featured by bird's-eye view (BEV) representation or object queries. However, the ill-posed transformation from image-plane view to 3D space inevitably causes feature clutter and distortion, making the objects blur into the background. To this end, we explore how to incorporate supplementary cues for differentiating objects in the transformed feature representation. Formally, we introduce OA-DET3D, a general plug-in module that improves 3D object detection by bringing object awareness into a variety of existing 3D object detection pipelines. Specifically, OA-DET3D boosts the representation of objects by leveraging object-centric depth information and foreground pseudo points. First, we use object-level supervision from the properties of each 3D bounding box to guide the network in learning the depth distribution. Next, we select foreground pixels using a 2D object detector and project them into 3D space for pseudo-voxel feature encoding. Finally, the object-aware depth features and pseudo-voxel features are incorporated into the BEV representation or query feature from the baseline model with a deformable attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and Argoverse 2 dataset to validate the merits of OA-DET3D. Our method achieves consistent improvements over the BEV-based baselines in terms of both average precision and comprehensive detection score.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification, crucial for legal and financial institutions, faces challenges including inter-writer similarity, intra-writer variations, and limited signature samples. To address these, we introduce the MultiScale Signature feature learning Network (MS-SigNet) with the co-tuplet loss, a novel metric learning loss designed for offline handwritten signature verification. MS-SigNet learns both global and regional signature features from multiple spatial scales, enhancing feature discrimination. This approach effectively distinguishes genuine signatures from skilled forgeries by capturing overall strokes and detailed local differences. The co-tuplet loss, focusing on multiple positive and negative examples, overcomes the limitations of typical metric learning losses by addressing inter-writer similarity and intra-writer variations and emphasizing informative examples. The code is available at https://github.com/ashleyfhh/MS-SigNet. We also present HanSig, a large-scale Chinese signature dataset to support robust system development for this language. The dataset is accessible at https://github.com/hsinmin/HanSig. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets in different languages demonstrate the promising performance of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving with enhanced safety and efficiency relies on vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception, which enables vehicles to share perception data, thereby enhancing situational awareness and overcoming the limitations of the sensing ability of individual vehicles. Vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception plays a crucial role in extending the perception range, increasing detection accuracy, and supporting more robust decision-making and control in complex environments. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception, introducing mathematical models that characterize the perception process under different collaboration strategies. Key techniques for enabling reliable perception sharing, such as agent selection, data alignment, and feature fusion, are examined in detail. In addition, major challenges are discussed, including differences in agents and models, uncertainty in perception outputs, and the impact of communication constraints such as transmission delay and data loss. The paper concludes by outlining promising research directions, including privacy-preserving artificial intelligence methods, collaborative intelligence, and integrated sensing frameworks to support future advancements in vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception.

Abstract: Current pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms use multi-label or multi-task learning frameworks with specific classification heads. These models often struggle with imbalanced data and noisy samples. Inspired by the success of generative models, we propose Sequence Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (SequencePAR), a novel sequence generation paradigm for PAR. SequencePAR extracts pedestrian features using a language-image pre-trained model and embeds the attribute set into query tokens guided by text prompts. A Transformer decoder generates human attributes by integrating visual features and attribute query tokens. The masked multi-head attention layer in the decoder prevents the model from predicting the next attribute during training. The extensive experiments on multiple PAR datasets validate the effectiveness of SequencePAR. Specifically, we achieve 84.92\%, 90.44\%, 90.73\%, and 90.46\% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the PETA dataset. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

Abstract: Despite remarkable recent progress, existing long-form VideoQA datasets fall short of meeting the criteria for genuine long-form video understanding. This is primarily due to the use of short videos for question curation, and the reliance on limited-length sub-clips as clues to answer those questions. Meanwhile, previous datasets have limited focus on question type and modality. To remedy this, we introduce LvBench, a Long-form video understanding benchmark for versatile multi-modal question-answering. Our LvBench stands out from existing long-form VideoQA datasets through three key characteristics: 1) Extended temporal durations: We consider videos ranging from 70 seconds to 4 hours, covering single-scene, multi-scene, and full-scene contexts. This design accounts for both video and clue lengths, capturing diverse contextual dynamics. 2) Diverse question types and modalities: LvBench introduces six distinct question types that evaluate various perceptual and cognitive capabilities, utilizing both video frames and subtitles. 3) High-quality annotations: We employ rigorous manual labeling by human annotators. Our dataset comprises 20,061 question-answer pairs sourced from 100 carefully selected movies across diverse genres, annotated collaboratively by multiple individuals. Analysis involving various baselines reveals a consistent trend: the performance of all existing methods significantly deteriorates when video and clue length increases. We expect LvBench to serve as a valuable resource for future works on long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) captures rich spectral information across contiguous wavelength bands, supporting applications in precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and autonomous driving. However, its high dimensionality poses computational challenges, particularly in real-time or resource-constrained settings. While prior band selection methods attempt to reduce complexity, they often rely on separate preprocessing steps and lack alignment with downstream tasks. We propose two novel supervised, embedded methods for task-specific HSI band selection that integrate directly into deep learning models. By embedding band selection within the training pipeline, our methods eliminate the need for separate preprocessing and ensure alignment with the target task. Extensive experiments on three remote sensing benchmarks and an autonomous driving dataset show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while selecting only a minimal number of bands. These results highlight the potential of efficient, task-specific HSI pipelines for practical deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods often rely on closed-source, large-scale LLMs for layout prediction, limiting accessibility and scalability. They also struggle with generating images from prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the generation task into multiple subtasks. First, the layout prediction stage is divided into numerical & spatial reasoning and bounding box visual planning, enabling even lightweight LLMs to achieve layout accuracy comparable to large-scale models. Second, the layout-to-image generation stage is divided into two steps to synthesize objects from easy ones to difficult ones. Experiments are conducted on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our method outperforms previous approaches with notable margins. In addition, visual results and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the perceptual quality, especially when generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.

Abstract: We present a novel 3D shape completion framework that unifies multimodal conditioning, leveraging both 2D images and 3D partial scans through a latent diffusion model. Shapes are represented as Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDFs) and encoded into a discrete latent space jointly supervised by 2D and 3D cues, enabling efficient high-resolution processing while reducing GPU memory usage by 30\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach guides the generation process with flexible multimodal conditioning, ensuring consistent integration of 2D and 3D information from encoding to reconstruction. Our training strategy simulates realistic partial observations, avoiding assumptions about input structure and improving robustness in real-world scenarios. Leveraging our efficient latent space and multimodal conditioning, our model generalizes across object categories, outperforming class-specific models by 12\% and class-agnostic models by 47\% in $l_1$ reconstruction error, while producing more diverse, realistic, and high-fidelity completions than prior approaches.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental perception task in autonomous driving, particularly for identifying drivable areas and lane markings to enable safe navigation. However, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce TwinLiteNet+, an enhanced multi-task segmentation model designed for real-time drivable area and lane segmentation with high efficiency. TwinLiteNet+ employs a hybrid encoder architecture that integrates stride-based dilated convolutions and depthwise separable dilated convolutions, balancing representational capacity and computational cost. To improve task-specific decoding, we propose two lightweight upsampling modules-Upper Convolution Block (UCB) and Upper Simple Block (USB)-alongside a Partial Class Activation Attention (PCAA) mechanism that enhances segmentation precision. The model is available in four configurations, ranging from the ultra-compact TwinLiteNet+_{Nano} (34K parameters) to the high-performance TwinLiteNet+_{Large} (1.94M parameters). On the BDD100K dataset, TwinLiteNet+_{Large} achieves 92.9% mIoU for drivable area segmentation and 34.2% IoU for lane segmentation-surpassing existing state-of-the-art models while requiring 11x fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) for computation. Extensive evaluations on embedded devices demonstrate superior inference speed, quantization robustness (INT8/FP16), and energy efficiency, validating TwinLiteNet+ as a compelling solution for real-world autonomous driving systems.

<title>StylizedGS: Controllable Stylization for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: As XR technology continues to advance rapidly, 3D generation and editing are increasingly crucial. Among these, stylization plays a key role in enhancing the appearance of 3D models. By utilizing stylization, users can achieve consistent artistic effects in 3D editing using a single reference style image, making it a user-friendly editing method. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods encounter efficiency issues that impact the user experience, and their implicit nature limits their ability to accurately transfer geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to apply flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable to foster an environment conducive to creative exploration. To address the above issues, we introduce StylizedGS, an efficient 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting representation. We propose a filter-based refinement to eliminate floaters that affect the stylization effects in the scene reconstruction process. The nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale, and regions during the stylization to possess customization capabilities. Our method achieves high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference speed.

Abstract: The human brain is a highly efficient processing unit, and understanding how it works can inspire new algorithms and architectures in machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brain Activation Network (BRACTIVE), a transformer-based approach to studying the human visual brain. The primary objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with their corresponding brain representations using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. It enables us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks. It encourages the potential of BRACTIVE in both neuroscience and machine intelligence studies.

<title>Towards Human-Level 3D Relative Pose Estimation: Generalizable, Training-Free, with Single Reference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18453</link>

Abstract: Humans can easily deduce the relative pose of a previously unseen object, without labeling or training, given only a single query-reference image pair. This is arguably achieved by incorporating i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single image, ii) render-and-compare simulation, and iii) rich semantic cue awareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable relative pose estimation method by elaborating 3D/2.5D shape perception with a 2.5D shape from an RGB-D reference, fulfilling the render-and-compare paradigm with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and leveraging the semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our differentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and the semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB and semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The refinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with the query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable renderer to refine the 3D relative pose. As a result, \emph{our method can be readily applied to unseen objects, given only a single RGB-D reference, without labeling or training}. Extensive experiments on LineMOD, LM-O, and YCB-V show that our training-free method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, especially under the rigorous \texttt{Acc@5/10/15}$^\circ$ metrics and the challenging cross-dataset settings.

Abstract: We present a new method for multimodal conditional 3D face geometry generation that allows user-friendly control over the output identity and expression via a number of different conditioning signals. Within a single model, we demonstrate 3D faces generated from artistic sketches, portrait photos, Canny edges, FLAME face model parameters, 2D face landmarks, or text prompts. Our approach is based on a diffusion process that generates 3D geometry in a 2D parameterized UV domain. Geometry generation passes each conditioning signal through a set of cross-attention layers (IP-Adapter), one set for each user-defined conditioning signal. The result is an easy-to-use 3D face generation tool that produces topology-consistent, high-quality geometry with fine-grain user control.

Abstract: We introduce FeatureSORT, a simple yet effective online multiple object tracker that reinforces the DeepSORT baseline with a redesigned detector and additional feature cues. In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.

Abstract: Absence of tamper-proof cattle identification technology was a significant problem preventing insurance companies from providing livestock insurance. This lack of technology had devastating financial consequences for marginal farmers as they did not have the opportunity to claim compensation for any unexpected events such as the accidental death of cattle in Bangladesh. Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we have solved the bottleneck of cattle identification by developing and introducing a muzzle-based cattle identification system. The uniqueness of cattle muzzles has been scientifically established, which resembles human fingerprints. This is the fundamental premise that prompted us to develop a cattle identification system that extracts the uniqueness of cattle muzzles. For this purpose, we collected 32,374 images from 826 cattle. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with sharpening filters was applied in the preprocessing steps to remove noise from images. We used the YOLO algorithm for cattle muzzle detection in the image and the FaceNet architecture to learn unified embeddings from muzzle images using squared $L_2$ distances. Our system performs with an accuracy of $96.489\%$, $F_1$ score of $97.334\%$, and a true positive rate (tpr) of $87.993\%$ at a remarkably low false positive rate (fpr) of $0.098\%$. This reliable and efficient system for identifying cattle can significantly advance livestock insurance and precision farming.

<title>Scalable Frame Sampling for Video Classification: A Semi-Optimal Policy Approach with Reduced Search Space</title>

Abstract: Given a video with $T$ frames, frame sampling is a task to select $N \ll T$ frames, so as to maximize the performance of a fixed video classifier. Not just brute-force search, but most existing methods suffer from its vast search space of $\binom{T}{N}$, especially when $N$ gets large. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective of reducing the search space from $O(T^N)$ to $O(T)$. Instead of exploring the entire $O(T^N)$ space, our proposed semi-optimal policy selects the top $N$ frames based on the independently estimated value of each frame using per-frame confidence, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We verify that our semi-optimal policy can efficiently approximate the optimal policy, particularly under practical settings. Additionally, through extensive experiments on various datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that learning our semi-optimal policy ensures stable and high performance regardless of the size of $N$ and $T$.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in tasks like visual question answering and document understanding. However, their potential to comprehend embodied environments and navigate within them remains underexplored. In this work, we first study the challenge of open-vocabulary object navigation by introducing DivScene, a large-scale dataset with 4,614 houses across 81 scene types and 5,707 kinds of target objects. Our dataset provides a much greater diversity of target objects and scene types than existing datasets, enabling a comprehensive task evaluation. We evaluated various methods with LVLMs and LLMs on our dataset and found that current models still fall short of open-vocab object navigation ability. Then, we fine-tuned LVLMs to predict the next action with CoT explanations. We observe that LVLM's navigation ability can be improved substantially with only BFS-generated shortest paths without any human supervision, surpassing GPT-4o by over 20% in success rates.

Abstract: Walking as a form of active travel is essential in promoting sustainable transport. It is thus crucial to accurately predict pedestrian crossing intention and avoid collisions, especially with the advent of autonomous and advanced driver-assisted vehicles. Current research leverages computer vision and machine learning advances to predict near-misses; however, this often requires high computation power to yield reliable results. In contrast, this work proposes a low-complexity ensemble-learning approach that employs contextual data for predicting the pedestrian's intent for crossing. The pedestrian is first detected, and their image is then compressed using skeleton-ization, and contextual information is added into a stacked ensemble-learning approach. Our experiments on different datasets achieve similar pedestrian intent prediction performance as the state-of-the-art approaches with 99.7% reduction in computational complexity. Our source code and trained models will be released upon paper acceptance

Abstract: In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.

Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), facilitates human self-localization and scene understanding by integrating nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, the disparity in modalities and perspectives poses a major challenge for effectively matching camera imagery with compact map representations, thereby limiting the full potential of VGI data in real-world localization applications.
  Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on the fusion of geometric and semantic understanding for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired visual localization approach based on first-person-view images against the OSM maps. It integrates semantic and geometric guidance to significantly improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method. Code, pre-trained models, CC validation benchmark, and additional results are available at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/OSMLoc.

Abstract: Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&amp;A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&amp;As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench

Abstract: Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be released on https://lolrudy.github.io/No3DTrackSG/.

Abstract: Despite the success of CNN models on a variety of Image classification and segmentation tasks, their extensive computational and storage demands pose considerable challenges for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices. Quantization is one technique that aims to alleviate these large storage requirements and speed up the inference process by reducing the precision of model parameters to lower-bit representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel post-training quantization method for model weights. Our method finds optimal clipping thresholds and scaling factors along with mathematical guarantees that our method minimizes quantization noise. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our quantization scheme significantly reduces model size and computational requirements while preserving model accuracy.

Abstract: Sparse-view reconstruction models typically require precise camera poses, yet obtaining these parameters from sparse-view images remains challenging. We introduce FreeSplatter, a scalable feed-forward framework that generates high-quality 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images while estimating camera parameters within seconds. Our approach employs a streamlined transformer architecture where self-attention blocks facilitate information exchange among multi-view image tokens, decoding them into pixel-aligned 3D Gaussian primitives within a unified reference frame. This representation enables both high-fidelity 3D modeling and efficient camera parameter estimation using off-the-shelf solvers. We develop two specialized variants--for object-centric and scene-level reconstruction--trained on comprehensive datasets. Remarkably, FreeSplatter outperforms several pose-dependent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) by a notable margin while achieving comparable or even better pose estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction approach MASt3R in challenging benchmarks. Beyond technical benchmarks, FreeSplatter streamlines text/image-to-3D content creation pipelines, eliminating the complexity of camera pose management while delivering exceptional visual fidelity.

Abstract: We present a new method for reconstructing the appearance properties of human faces from a lightweight capture procedure in an unconstrained environment. Our method recovers the surface geometry, diffuse albedo, specular intensity and specular roughness from a monocular video containing a simple head rotation in-the-wild. Notably, we make no simplifying assumptions on the environment lighting, and we explicitly take visibility and occlusions into account. As a result, our method can produce facial appearance maps that approach the fidelity of studio-based multi-view captures, but with a far easier and cheaper procedure.

Abstract: Human drivers rely on commonsense reasoning to navigate diverse and dynamic real-world scenarios. Existing end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models are typically optimized to mimic driving patterns observed in data, without capturing the underlying reasoning processes. This limitation constrains their ability to handle challenging driving scenarios. To close this gap, we propose VLM-AD, a method that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to enhance training by providing additional supervision that incorporates unstructured reasoning information and structured action labels. Such supervision enhances the model's ability to learn richer feature representations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns. Importantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it practical for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, VLM-AD achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and reduced collision rates on the nuScenes dataset. It further improves route completion and driving scores under closed-loop evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon, interactive driving scenarios and its potential for safe and reliable real-world deployment.

Abstract: Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks. We release code and model weights at https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu

Abstract: 3D scene generation has garnered growing attention in recent years and has made significant progress. Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.

<title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>

Abstract: The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

Abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation has become a new challenging research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures and need to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and contains all necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions by leveraging knowledge from seen compositions. Current methods align textual prototypes with visual features via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but suffer from two limitations: (1) modality gaps hinder the discrimination of semantically similar pairs, and (2) single-modal textual prototypes lack fine-grained visual cues. In this paper, we introduce Visual Proxy Learning, a method that reduces modality gaps and enhances compositional generalization. We initialize visual proxies for attributes, objects, and their compositions using text representations and optimize the visual space to capture fine-grained cues, improving visual representations. Additionally, we propose Cross-Modal Joint Learning (CMJL), which imposes cross-modal constraints between the text-image and fine-grained visual spaces, improving generalization for unseen compositions and discriminating similar pairs. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in closed-world scenarios and competitive results in open-world settings across four CZSL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in compositional generalization.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.

Abstract: This work investigates the capabilities of current vision-language models (VLMs) in visual understanding and attribute measurement of primitive shapes using a benchmark focused on controlled 2D shape configurations with variations in spatial positioning, occlusion, rotation, size, and shape attributes such as type, quadrant, center-coordinates, rotation, occlusion status, and color as shown in Figure 1 and supplementary Figures S3-S81. We fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs (2B-8B parameters) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and validate them on multiple out-of-domain (OD) scenarios from our proposed benchmark. Our findings reveal that coherent sentence-based outputs outperform tuple formats, particularly in OD scenarios with large domain gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that scaling numeric tokens during loss computation enhances numerical approximation capabilities, further improving performance on spatial and measurement tasks. These results highlight the importance of output format design, loss scaling strategies, and robust generalization techniques in enhancing the training and fine-tuning of VLMs, particularly for tasks requiring precise spatial approximations and strong OD generalization.

Abstract: Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation.Conclusions: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in unlocking the potential of neuromorphic cameras, also called ''event camera'', is the development of novel methods that solve the multi-variable problem of adjusting their biases parameters to accommodate a desired task. Actually, it is very difficult to find in the literature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired application. In this paper we present a tuning parameters heuristic for the biases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in staring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's potential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as much as possible. In the presentation, we translate the experimental properties of event camera and systemic constrains into mathematical terms, and show, under certain assumptions and classical tools from functional analysis, how the multi-variable problem collapses into a two-parameter problem that can be solved experimentally. A main conclusion that will be demonstrated is that for certain desired signals, such as the one provided by an incandescent lamp powered by the periodic electrical grid, the optimal values of the camera are very far from the default values recommended by the manufacturer.

Abstract: Continual learning of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt to expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLM's recognition ability. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust vision-GA-class trilateral associations rather than relying solely on vision-class connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance in VLM-based recognition compared to existing continual learning methods.

Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of "evidence for reasoning" to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks. Moreover, VIKSER achieves performance on par with leading proprietary models, such as the latest ChatGPT-5.

Abstract: Conventional Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) assumes complete access to visual, textual, and acoustic modalities. However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this assumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs, leading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches also tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each modality's unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which refines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality and specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by contrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature quality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality interdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations between labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and $M^3ED$, demonstrate that RAMer achieves state-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.

Abstract: Omnimodal Large Language Models (OLLMs) have shown significant progress in integrating vision and text, but still struggle with integrating vision and audio, often exhibiting suboptimal performance when processing audio queries compared to text queries. This disparity is primarily due to insufficient alignment between vision and audio modalities during training, leading to inadequate attention to visual information when using audio queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Self-Knowledge Distillation (Self-KD) training method where the vision-text component of the OLLM serves as the teacher and the vision-audio component as the student. This enables the model to process audio in a manner analogous to its text processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Self-KD is an effective method for enhancing the vision-audio capabilities of OLLMs by learning from the vision-text components, which subsequently improves the interaction between audio and images and results in improved performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based lip-syncing generative models have demonstrated their ability to produce highly synchronized talking face videos for visual dubbing. Although these models excel at lip synchronization, they often struggle to maintain fine-grained control over facial details in generated images. In this work, we identify "lip averaging" phenomenon where the model fails to preserve subtle facial details when dubbing unseen in-the-wild videos. This issue arises because the commonly used UNet backbone primarily integrates audio features into visual representations in the latent space via cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale fusion, but it struggles to retain fine-grained lip details in the generated faces. To address this issue, we propose UnAvgLip, which extracts identity embeddings from reference videos to generate highly faithful facial sequences while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Specifically, our method comprises two primary components: (1) an Identity Perceiver module that encodes facial embeddings to align with conditioned audio features; and (2) an ID-CrossAttn module that injects facial embeddings into the generation process, enhancing model's capability of identity retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, at a modest training and inference cost, UnAvgLip effectively mitigates the "averaging" phenomenon in lip inpainting, significantly preserving unique facial characteristics while maintaining precise lip synchronization. Compared with the original approach, our method demonstrates significant improvements of 5% on the identity consistency metric and 2% on the SSIM metric across two benchmark datasets (HDTF and LRW).

<title>Does Acceleration Cause Hidden Instability in Vision Language Models? Uncovering Instance-Level Divergence Through a Large-Scale Empirical Study</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful yet computationally intensive for widespread practical deployments. To address such challenge without costly re-training, post-training acceleration techniques like quantization and token reduction are extensively explored. However, current acceleration evaluations primarily target minimal overall performance degradation, overlooking a crucial question: does the accelerated model still give the same answers to the same questions as it did before acceleration? This is vital for stability-centered industrial applications where consistently correct answers for specific, known situations are paramount, such as in AI-based disease diagnosis. We systematically investigate this for accelerated VLMs, testing four leading models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL) with eight acceleration methods on ten multi-modal benchmarks. Our findings are stark: despite minimal aggregate performance drops, accelerated models changed original answers up to 20% of the time. Critically, up to 6.5% of these changes converted correct answers to incorrect. Input perturbations magnified these inconsistencies, and the trend is confirmed by case studies with the medical VLM LLaVA-Med. This research reveals a significant oversight in VLM acceleration, stressing an urgent need for instance-level stability checks to ensure trustworthy real-world deployment.

Abstract: Rotation averaging is a key subproblem in applications of computer vision and robotics. Many methods for solving this problem exist, and there are also several theoretical results analyzing difficulty and optimality. However, one aspect that most of these have in common is a focus on the isotropic setting, where the intrinsic uncertainties in the measurements are not fully incorporated into the resulting optimization task. Recent empirical results suggest that moving to an anisotropic framework, where these uncertainties are explicitly included, can result in an improvement of solution quality. However, global optimization for rotation averaging has remained a challenge in this scenario. In this work we show how anisotropic costs can be incorporated in certifiably optimal rotation averaging. We also demonstrate how existing solvers, designed for isotropic situations, fail in the anisotropic setting. Finally, we propose a stronger relaxation and empirically show that it recovers global optima in all tested datasets and leads to more accurate reconstructions in almost all scenes.

Abstract: As recent text-conditioned diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images, concerns over their potential misuse have also grown. This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), effectively understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge. Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, VILA-40B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art results on long-form video benchmarks: LLaVA-Video-72B reaches 66.8 (+4.3) on LongVideoBench and 77.0 (+2.7) on MLVU, while Aria obtains 39.2 on HourVideo surpassing the Gemini-1.5-pro by 1.9 points. We will release all datasets and models at https://generative-sampler.github.io.

Abstract: Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.

Abstract: Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on sequence sampling or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. Our SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks, and their corresponding hierarchical agents by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the task of generating expansive outdoor scenes, ranging from castles to high-rises. Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.

<title>VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.

Abstract: Physical agility is a necessary skill in competitive table tennis, but by no means sufficient. Champions excel in this fast-paced and highly dynamic environment by anticipating their opponent's intent - buying themselves the necessary time to react. In this work, we take one step towards designing such an anticipatory agent. Previous works have developed systems capable of real-time table tennis gameplay, though they often do not leverage anticipation. Among the works that forecast opponent actions, their approaches are limited by dataset size and variety. Our paper contributes (1) a scalable system for reconstructing monocular video of table tennis matches in 3D and (2) an uncertainty-aware controller that anticipates opponent actions. We demonstrate in simulation that our policy improves the ball return rate against high-speed hits from 49.9% to 59.0% as compared to a baseline non-anticipatory policy.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in applications such as security surveillance and criminal investigations. Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. Analyzing histological images of melanoma by localizing and classifying tissues and cell nuclei is considered the gold standard method for diagnosis and treatment options for patients. While many computerized approaches have been proposed for automatic analysis, most perform tissue-based analysis and nuclei (cell)-based analysis as separate tasks, which might be suboptimal.
  In this work, using the PUMA challenge dataset, we propose a novel multi-stage deep learning approach by combining tissue and nuclei information in a unified framework based on the auto-context concept to perform segmentation and classification in histological images of melanoma. Through pre-training and further post-processing, our approach achieved second and first place rankings in the PUMA challenge, with average micro Dice tissue score and summed nuclei F1-score of 73.40% for Track 1 and 63.48% for Track 2, respectively. Furthermore, through a comprehensive ablation study and additional evaluation on an external dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework components as well as the generalization capabilities of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Video retrieval requires aligning visual content with corresponding natural language descriptions. In this paper, we introduce Modality Auxiliary Concepts for Video Retrieval (MAC-VR), a novel approach that leverages modality-specific tags -- automatically extracted from foundation models -- to enhance video retrieval. We propose to align modalities in a latent space, along with learning and aligning auxiliary latent concepts derived from the features of a video and its corresponding caption. We introduce these auxiliary concepts to improve the alignment of visual and textual latent concepts, allowing concepts to be distinguished from one another.
  We conduct extensive experiments on six diverse datasets: two different splits of MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, TGIF, Charades and YouCook2. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that modality-specific tags improve cross-modal alignment, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across three datasets and performing comparably or better across others.

Abstract: Enhancement of images from RGB cameras is of particular interest due to its wide range of ever-increasing applications such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, automated driving, etc. In autonomous driving, various techniques are used to enhance image quality under challenging lighting conditions. These include artificial augmentation to improve visibility in poor nighttime conditions, illumination-invariant imaging to reduce the impact of lighting variations, and shadow mitigation to ensure consistent image clarity in bright daylight. This paper proposes a pipeline for Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability in images for automated driving applications while preserving color and texture details. The Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability pipeline is compared to the widely used CLAHE technique and evaluated based on illumination uniformity and visual perception quality metrics. The results also demonstrate a significant improvement over CLAHE, enhancing a YOLO-based drivable area segmentation algorithm.

Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching item representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism jointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human information integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT outperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging cognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of multimodal data in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenging due to the difficulty in capturing depth information from single-camera images. A common strategy involves transforming front-view (FV) images into bird's-eye-view (BEV) space through inverse perspective mapping (IPM), facilitating lane detection using BEV features. However, IPM's flat-ground assumption and loss of contextual information lead to inaccuracies in reconstructing 3D information, especially height. In this paper, we introduce a BEV-based framework to address these limitations and improve 3D lane detection accuracy. Our approach incorporates a Hierarchical Depth-Aware Head that provides multi-scale depth features, mitigating the flat-ground assumption by enhancing spatial awareness across varying depths. Additionally, we leverage Depth Prior Distillation to transfer semantic depth knowledge from a teacher model, capturing richer structural and contextual information for complex lane structures. To further refine lane continuity and ensure smooth lane reconstruction, we introduce a Conditional Random Field module that enforces spatial coherence in lane predictions. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of z-axis error and outperforms other methods in the field in overall performance.

Abstract: In federated learning, textual prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP) by tuning lightweight input tokens (or prompts) on local client data, while keeping network weights frozen. After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.

Abstract: Learned video coding (LVC) has recently achieved superior coding performance. In this paper, we model the rate-quality (R-Q) relationship for learned video coding by a parametric function. We learn a neural network, termed RQNet, to characterize the relationship between the bitrate and quality level according to video content and coding context. The predicted (R,Q) results are further integrated with those from previously coded frames using the least-squares method to determine the parameters of our R-Q model on-the-fly. Compared to the conventional approaches, our method accurately estimates the R-Q relationship, enabling the online adaptation of model parameters to enhance both flexibility and precision. Experimental results show that our R-Q model achieves significantly smaller bitrate deviations than the baseline method on commonly used datasets with minimal additional complexity.

Abstract: Text-based pedestrian search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian in untrimmed images using natural language descriptions. However, in complex scenes with multiple pedestrians, existing methods are limited by uncertainties in detection and matching, leading to degraded performance. To address this, we propose UPD-TBPS, a novel framework comprising three modules: Multi-granularity Uncertainty Estimation (MUE), Prototype-based Uncertainty Decoupling (PUD), and Cross-modal Re-identification (ReID). MUE conducts multi-granularity queries to identify potential targets and assigns confidence scores to reduce early-stage uncertainty. PUD leverages visual context decoupling and prototype mining to extract features of the target pedestrian described in the query. It separates and learns pedestrian prototype representations at both the coarse-grained cluster level and the fine-grained individual level, thereby reducing matching uncertainty. ReID evaluates candidates with varying confidence levels, improving detection and retrieval accuracy. Experiments on CUHK-SYSU-TBPS and PRW-TBPS datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in soccer understanding have demonstrated rapid progress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive framework for holistic soccer understanding. Concretely, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we construct SoccerWiki, the first large-scale multimodal soccer knowledge base, integrating rich domain knowledge about players, teams, referees, and venues to enable knowledge-driven reasoning; (ii) we present SoccerBench, the largest and most comprehensive soccer-specific benchmark, featuring around 10K multimodal (text, image, video) multi-choice QA pairs across 13 distinct tasks; (iii) we introduce SoccerAgent, a novel multi-agent system that decomposes complex soccer questions via collaborative reasoning, leveraging domain expertise from SoccerWiki and achieving robust performance; (iv) extensive evaluations and comparisons with representative MLLMs on SoccerBench highlight the superiority of our agentic system.

Abstract: Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models across seismic data representing diverse geologic, acquisition and processing settings. Distributional shifts between data sources, limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and inconsistent evaluation protocols all remain major roadblocks to deploying reliable models in real-world exploration. In this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly designed to provide guidelines for domain shift strategies in seismic interpretation. Our benchmark spans over 200 combinations of model architectures, datasets and training strategies, across three datasets (synthetic and real) including FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining, fine-tuning, and joint training under varying domain shifts. Our analysis shows that common fine-tuning practices can lead to catastrophic forgetting, especially when source and target datasets are disjoint, and that larger models such as Segformer are more robust than smaller architectures. We also find that domain adaptation methods outperform fine-tuning when shifts are large, yet underperform when domains are similar. Finally, we complement segmentation metrics with a novel analysis based on fault characteristic descriptors, revealing how models absorb structural biases from training datasets. Overall, we establish a robust experimental baseline that provides insights into tradeoffs in current fault delineation workflows and highlights directions for building more generalizable and interpretable models.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations. Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story and an improvement in creativity from 2.58 to 3.38 (+31.0%) when compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, and low-cost nature, existing methods suffer from Hierarchical Neural Encoding Neglect (HNEN)-a critical limitation where flat neural representations fail to model the brain's hierarchical visual processing hierarchy. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of visual cortex, we propose ViEEG, a neuro-We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning for EEG-CLIP representation alignment, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG significantly outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. Results on the THINGS-MEG dataset further confirm ViEEG's generalization to different neural modalities. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for EEG brain decoding. inspired framework that addresses HNEN. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from low-level to high-level vision.

Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity underwater scenes remains a challenging task due to light absorption, scattering, and limited visibility inherent in aquatic environments. This paper presents an enhanced Gaussian Splatting-based framework that improves both the visual quality and geometric accuracy of deep underwater rendering. We propose decoupled learning for RGB channels, guided by the physics of underwater attenuation, to enable more accurate colour restoration. To address sparse-view limitations and improve view consistency, we introduce a frame interpolation strategy with a novel adaptive weighting scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function aimed at reducing noise while preserving edges, which is essential for deep-sea content. We also release a newly collected dataset, Submerged3D, captured specifically in deep-sea environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with PSNR gains up to 1.90dB, delivering superior perceptual quality and robustness, and offering promising directions for marine robotics and underwater visual analytics. The code of RUSplatting is available at https://github.com/theflash987/RUSplatting and the dataset Submerged3D can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/records/15482420.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems. Project website: https://mliuby.github.io/MedEBench_Website/

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock management. We introduce CarboFormer, a lightweight semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates an optimized encoder-decoder architecture with specialized multi-scale feature fusion and auxiliary supervision strategies to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery while achieving competitive accuracy with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboFormer achieves competitive performance with 84.88\% mIoU on CCR and 92.98\% mIoU on RTA, while maintaining computational efficiency with only 5.07M parameters and operating at 84.68 FPS. The model shows particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios and significantly outperforms other lightweight methods like SegFormer-B0 (83.36\% mIoU on CCR) and SegNeXt (82.55\% mIoU on CCR), making it suitable for real-time monitoring on resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by providing robust and efficient tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.

Abstract: With the wide application of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become the key to tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, the significant domain shifts caused by environmental changes, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods seriously hinder the generalization ability of the model in cross-region, cross-season, and complex agricultural scenarios. This paper explores how domain adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges to improve cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis. DA is considered a promising solution in the case of limited labeled data, insufficient model adaptability, and dynamic changes in the field environment. This paper systematically reviews the latest advances in DA in agricultural images in recent years, focusing on application scenarios such as crop health monitoring, pest and disease detection, and fruit identification, in which DA methods have significantly improved cross-domain performance. We categorize DA methods into shallow learning and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised strategies, and pay special attention to the adversarial learning-based techniques that perform well in complex scenarios. In addition, this paper also reviews the main public datasets of agricultural images, and evaluates their advantages and limitations in DA research. Overall, this study provides a complete framework and some key insights that can be used as a reference for the research and development of domain adaptation methods in future agricultural vision tasks.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this compression process inevitably introduces semantic degradation that is difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this, we formalize the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality Assessment (CFQA), aiming to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset, comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance degradation is provided as true semantic distortion for evaluating CFQA metrics. We systematically assess three widely used metrics -- MSE, cosine similarity, and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) -- in terms of their ability to capture semantic degradation. Our findings demonstrate the representativeness of the proposed dataset while underscoring the need for more sophisticated metrics capable of measuring semantic distortion in compressed features. This work advances the field by establishing a foundational benchmark and providing a critical resource for the community to explore CFQA. To foster further research, we release the dataset and all associated source code at https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment.

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal vision-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date offer poor performance for compositional reasoning. This paper presents VLAgent, a vision-language agent system for vision-text compositional reasoning with three novel features. First, VLAgent leverages a pre-trained LLM with few-shot context learning to generate the planning script for each compositional reasoning task and provides a backend engine to generate and perform executable runtime, which maps the planning script into executable code using the VLAgent library for VLAgent executor. Second, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which identifies and corrects logic errors embedded in the LLM-generated planning script, to further enhance the quality of script-executable mapping. Third, VLAgent introduces the compositional reasoning output verifier, which validates and refines the output of complex compositional reasoning steps, by leveraging complementary reasoning techniques, e.g., ensemble learning and caption analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on six visual benchmarks and compared to a dozen of the SoTA visual reasoning models. The results show that VLAgent outperforms existing representative approaches for compositional text-visual reasoning. Our code and datasets with outputs will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/HCPLab-SYSU/DART.

Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10 classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot, 10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7% has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement. The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the 3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of this tornado using 3DGS.

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks. To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results. However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently. To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions. Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for future research.

<title>LOD-GS: Level-of-Detail-Sensitive 3D Gaussian Splatting for Detail Conserved Anti-Aliasing</title>

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation, overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been open-sourced.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, attains state-of-the-art results regarding the mean AP score, w.r.t. the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Abstract: Biomedical datasets are often constrained by stringent privacy requirements and frequently suffer from severe class imbalance. These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%). These results establish synthetic image generation as a valuable tool for biomedical machine learning, enhancing data coverage and facilitating secure data sharing while preserving patient privacy. Paper code is publicly available at https://github.com/JanCarreras24/CytoDiff.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from naturalistic driving videos, leveraging large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.

<title>Discontinuity-aware Normal Integration for Generic Central Camera Models</title>

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central camera models.

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences, we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk429/GPI-Net.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM, which consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect the attacks in the dataset, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system achieves an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

Abstract: Classroom behavior monitoring is a critical aspect of educational research, with significant implications for student engagement and learning outcomes. Recent advancements in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models offer promising tools for automatically analyzing complex classroom interactions from video recordings. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several state-of-the-art open-source VQA models, including LLaMA2, LLaMA3, QWEN3, and NVILA, in the context of classroom behavior analysis. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.

<title>Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.

<title>Beyond Gloss: A Hand-Centric Framework for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation</title>

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture, often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset, SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an absolute scale over strong baselines.

Abstract: Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.

Abstract: Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates.
  To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.

Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) task aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.

Abstract: Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work that studies retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.

Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.

Abstract: Shortcut learning, where machine learning models exploit spurious correlations in data instead of capturing meaningful features, poses a significant challenge to building robust and generalizable models. This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are correlated with class labels both positionally and via intensity, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing on two different test sets-one containing the same shortcuts and another without them-to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. Further, we evaluate susceptibility to shortcut learning across different learning rates. Our analysis reveals that CNNs at lower learning rates tend to be more reserved against entirely picking up shortcut features, while ViTs, particularly those without positional encodings, almost entirely ignore the distinctive image features in the presence of shortcuts.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.

<title>Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Gaps: Frequency-Aware Perturbation and Selection for Single-shot Multi-Parametric Mapping Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably advanced medical imaging, with emerging methods using synthetic data to address data scarcity while introducing synthetic-to-real gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/flyannie/FPS.

<title>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.

<title>SALT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation</title>

Abstract: The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings. The code for SALT is available at: https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/SALT

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation. The inference code and model are available at https://github.com/dpetrini/multiple-view.

<title>Network Inversion for Generating Confidently Classified Counterfeits</title>

Abstract: In vision classification, generating inputs that elicit confident predictions is key to understanding model behavior and reliability, especially under adversarial or out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. While traditional adversarial methods rely on perturbing existing inputs to fool a model, they are inherently input-dependent and often fail to ensure both high confidence and meaningful deviation from the training data. In this work, we extend network inversion techniques to generate Confidently Classified Counterfeits (CCCs), synthetic samples that are confidently classified by the model despite being significantly different from the training distribution and independent of any specific input. We alter inversion technique by replacing soft vector conditioning with one-hot class conditioning and introducing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss between the one-hot label and the classifier's output distribution. CCCs offer a model-centric perspective on confidence, revealing that models can assign high confidence to entirely synthetic, out-of-distribution inputs. This challenges the core assumption behind many OOD detection techniques based on thresholding prediction confidence, which assume that high-confidence outputs imply in-distribution data, and highlights the need for more robust uncertainty estimation in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting methods excel at capturing fine textures but often overlook model compactness, resulting in massive splat counts, bloated memory, long training, and complex post-processing. We present Micro-Splatting: Two-Stage Adaptive Growth and Refinement, a unified, in-training pipeline that preserves visual detail while drastically reducing model complexity without any post-processing or auxiliary neural modules. In Stage I (Growth), we introduce a trace-based covariance regularization to maintain near-isotropic Gaussians, mitigating low-pass filtering in high-frequency regions and improving spherical-harmonic color fitting. We then apply gradient-guided adaptive densification that subdivides splats only in visually complex regions, leaving smooth areas sparse. In Stage II (Refinement), we prune low-impact splats using a simple opacity-scale importance score and merge redundant neighbors via lightweight spatial and feature thresholds, producing a lean yet detail-rich model. On four object-centric benchmarks, Micro-Splatting reduces splat count and model size by up to 60% and shortens training by 20%, while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS in real-time rendering. These results demonstrate that Micro-Splatting delivers both compactness and high fidelity in a single, efficient, end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a simple yet effective approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in 16 bits, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B within a single 24GB GPU. Code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research. All training and inference code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA.

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage burden. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models (LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3) across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

<title>Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings, cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5 fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%. Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and further clinical validation.

<div> Keywords: zero-shot appearance transfer, large-scale image generation, attention leakage, Q-Align, semantic alignment

Summary: 
Q-Align addresses the challenge of attention leakage in zero-shot appearance transfer by utilizing Query-Query alignment, Key-Value rearrangement, and attention refinement. By incorporating Query-Query alignment, sophisticated spatial semantic mapping between images is facilitated, enhancing feature correspondence through realignment with Key-Value rearrangement. Attention refinement is utilized with rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency. Extensive experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of Q-Align, showcasing superior appearance fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods while still preserving competitive structure. Through Q-Align, semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer is significantly improved.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement, enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency. We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, feature caching, ERTACache, inference speedup, visual quality improvement

Summary: 
ERTACache addresses the computational overhead of diffusion models by introducing a caching framework that reduces errors caused by feature shift and step amplification. It employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps and dynamically adjusts integration intervals for efficient sampling. ERTACache analytically approximates cache-induced errors, enabling up to 2x inference speedup while maintaining or enhancing visual quality. Experimental results on image and video generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ERTACache, with significant improvements in efficiency observed on the Wan2.1 video diffusion model. The code for ERTACache is publicly available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

<div> Keywords: Temporal Visual Screening, Video Large Language Models, fine-grained temporal semantics, cognitive load, video-language understanding

Summary:
Temporal Visual Screening (TVS) is a new task that preprocesses video question answering and instruction tuning data by focusing on critical video segments, aligning queries with visual information, and optimizing reasoning burden. It is integrated as a front-end adapter task in Video Large Language Models to improve understanding of video-language interactions. The proposed benchmark, ReSimplifyIt, outperforms previous approaches on video trimming and query rewriting, highlighting the effectiveness of TVS. Experimental results show relative gains in training and inference accuracy, demonstrating the impact of temporal information screening in enhancing video-language understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.

<div> Keywords: surgical tools, localisation, deep learning, pose annotations, dataset

Summary: 
The article introduces the importance of localising surgical tools in computer-assisted interventions and proposes using skeletal pose annotations as an efficient annotation approach. The new dataset, ROBUST-MIPS, combines tool pose and tool instance segmentation data to enable a comprehensive study of these annotation styles. The dataset aims to facilitate the comparison of different annotation methods for various tasks. A benchmark using popular pose estimation methods shows promising results with high-quality outcomes. The authors also provide benchmark models and custom tool pose annotation software to encourage the adoption of pose annotations. Overall, the article advocates for the use of pose annotations as a more effective and scalable solution for surgical tool localisation in medical technologies. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks. Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark models and custom tool pose annotation software.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-Image generation, safety mechanisms, Safe-Control, data-driven strategies, plug-and-play design 

Summary: 
Safe-Control is a new safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in Text-to-Image models. It addresses limitations of existing safety mechanisms by injecting safety control signals into models and allowing for the construction of various safety patches to meet evolving requirements. Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation while maintaining image quality and text alignment. It outperforms seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms in reducing unsafe content generation. Safe-Control reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7% compared to approximately 20% for baseline methods under unsafe prompts and adversarial attacks. This innovative plug-and-play design makes Safe-Control compatible with similar T2I models and ensures adaptability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility. This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV, we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments. The project page is available at https://gennav.vercel.app/.

Summary:
R-4B is introduced as an auto-thinking Multimodal Large Language Model that dynamically determines when to engage in the thinking process based on problem complexity. The model is trained on a diverse dataset and undergoes a second training phase under an improved Bi-mode Policy Optimization framework. Through this approach, R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 25 challenging benchmarks by outperforming Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and matching the performance of larger models like Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive tasks. This innovative model showcases enhanced accuracy in decision-making regarding when to activate the thinking mode, resulting in improved efficiency and computational cost-effectiveness. <div>
arXiv:2508.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

The article introduces a novel framework called RadGS-Reg for vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration. This framework combines 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS) reconstruction and 3D/3D registration to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance in image-guided navigation. The RadGS reconstruction module utilizes a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism to focus on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. A patient-specific pre-training strategy is employed to adapt the framework from simulated to real data and learn vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experimental results on in-house datasets show that RadGS-Reg outperforms existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for both tasks. The code for RadGS-Reg is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS) reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism, focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/shenao1995/RadGS_Reg.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse, and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature, future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at https://github.com/kdmayer/SYNBUILD-3D.

Summary:  
Homographies are essential in geometric computer vision, with homography estimation crucial for various tasks. Real images often have lens distortions, including radial distortion, which require simultaneous estimation with homography for accurate results. This paper presents a unified approach to solve three cases of radial distortion in homographies: distortion in one image, identical distortion in both images, and independent distortion in both images. The proposed minimal solvers are fast, stable, and accurate, outperforming existing solvers while maintaining similar precision. The solvers are tested on benchmarks, including fisheye camera images, demonstrating their effectiveness. The source code for the solvers will be available upon publication acceptance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i) distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and (iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

<div> Keywords: Concept Activation Vectors, Global Concept Activation Vector, contrastive learning, attention-based fusion, deep neural networks

Summary:
Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are used to interpret deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to predefined concepts. However, CAVs computed independently at different layers often show inconsistencies, leading to unreliable cross-layer comparisons. To address this issue, a novel framework called Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV) is proposed, which unifies CAVs into a single, semantically consistent representation using contrastive learning and attention-based fusion. GCAV significantly reduces variance in TCAV scores, enhances concept relevance, and ensures more stable and reliable concept attributions. A method called Testing with Global Concept Activation Vectors (TGCAV) is introduced to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. Through extensive experiments on various deep neural networks, GCAV proves to mitigate concept inconsistency, improve concept localization, and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Overall, GCAV offers a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

However, when computed independently at different layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers, enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts.

Summary:<br />
Current object re-identification methods face challenges in generalization and data labeling. This paper introduces Visual In-Context Prompting (VICP), a novel framework that enables models to generalize to novel categories using in-context examples as prompts. VICP combines language-based models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to extract identity-sensitive features. By aligning semantic concepts from LLMs with pre-trained priors of VFMs, VICP eliminates the need for dataset-specific retraining. The proposed ShopID10K dataset facilitates evaluation. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that VICP outperforms baselines on unseen categories. The code is available at the specified GitHub repository. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models (e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture \textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only \textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Summary: 
- The study focused on automated segmentation of pancreatic tumors using MRI data, which is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning.
- SegResNet models within the Auto3DSeg architecture were trained and evaluated on two different MRI tasks, achieving moderate performance.
- The challenges of segmentation were highlighted due to limited dataset availability and anatomical variability.
- Results showed better performance on Task 1 compared to Task 2, indicating the influence of different MRI sequences.
- The study emphasizes the need for larger and standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility. <div>
arXiv:2508.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1, the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203 mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger, standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

<div> Keywords: pretrained segmentation model, cardiac MRI, generalization, reverse imaging, spin properties<br />
Summary:<br />
Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac MRI often struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to variations in image contrast resulting from changes in imaging protocols. To address this challenge, a novel physics-driven method called Reverse Imaging is introduced. This method leverages the core spin properties governing all MR images to infer these properties from observed images, enabling data augmentation and domain adaptation. By solving ill-posed inverse problems regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties learned from a specific dataset, Reverse Imaging estimates spin properties to facilitate image synthesis for segmentation tasks on diverse imaging protocols. This approach leads to highly accurate segmentation results across various contrasts and protocols, demonstrating enhanced generalization capability for cardiac MRI segmentation tasks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density, T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols, realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<div> pose estimation, 3D human mesh recovery, personalized, body fitting, Point Diffusion Transformer

Summary:
The article introduces a personalized approach, PHD, for 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) and body fitting that focuses on leveraging user-specific shape information to improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are typically designed to be user-agnostic, leading to compromises in 3D accuracy while refining poses using constraints from 2D images. PHD decouples this process by first calibrating the user's body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process based on that shape. A body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, guides the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss, effectively mitigating errors from excessive reliance on 2D constraints. This approach improves pelvis-aligned pose accuracy as well as absolute pose accuracy, which is often overlooked in prior work. Additionally, PHD is highly data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data for training, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance performance. <div>

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance their performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces Print2Volume, a framework for generating synthetic 3D fingerprints from 2D fingerprint images using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The framework consists of three stages: a style transfer module, a 3D structure expansion network, and an OCT realism refiner. By utilizing this framework, a large-scale synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples was created. The synthetic data showed high quality and significantly improved recognition performance when used for pre-training a model. The Equal Error Rate (EER) was reduced from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD benchmark by fine-tuning the model on a small real-world dataset. This approach effectively overcomes the data scarcity issue in OCT-based fingerprint recognition, enabling the development of advanced algorithms, particularly deep learning models. <div>

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data scarcity.

Summary:
Gynecologic laparoscopy is a form of minimally invasive surgery used for various treatments, with the ability to record videos crucial for post-surgical activities. The manual analysis of these recordings is time-consuming, leading to the development of computer vision and machine learning approaches. However, the scarcity of sample data in the medical field poses a challenge. In response, the Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) has been created, containing region-based annotations of endometriosis, a common medical condition involving the displacement of uterine-like tissue. This dataset, developed in collaboration with medical experts, is the first of its kind and aims to support research and advancements in the field of minimally invasive surgery and medical image analysis.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings, as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed. Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical experts in the field.

Summary: 
This study focuses on segmenting and recognizing surgical instruments in videos from laparoscopic gynecology surgeries. The researchers used a region-based fully convolutional network for both instance-aware instrument segmentation and instrument recognition. While they were successful in segmenting instrument regions accurately with a low number of training examples, identifying the specific instrument proved to be a challenging task due to the high similarity among surgical instruments. The study highlights the importance of automatic content indexing in medical video archives and the complexity of distinguishing and recognizing surgical instruments in recorded surgery footage. <div>
arXiv:2508.21399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy. However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical instruments.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and their significance in various fields such as pathology and oncology. Currently, there is a lack of standard metadata for WSI selection, making manual inspection for algorithm training cumbersome. To address this, a framework is proposed to generate a 2D index map and profiling mechanism, focusing on clinical pathology. This approach aims to enhance WSI collections with detailed tissue maps, categorizing segments based on source, tissue type, and pathological alterations. The standardization of syntax and semantics ensures interoperability between different catalogs. The benefits of this standard are demonstrated through examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning applications, and graph-based representations. By providing fine-grained information about WSI content, this framework offers a systematic approach to selecting cohorts for AI algorithm training or validation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.

Summary:
Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods have made significant advancements in enabling models to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous ones. However, these methods usually require fully labeled datasets, which are often unrealistic in practice. In this work, an Unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL) is proposed to address this limitation. By integrating pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection, ICPL achieves competitive results on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 datasets. Compared to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods, ICPL outperforms them by more than 5% in final accuracy. Furthermore, the method is shown to be applicable to fine-grained datasets, demonstrating real-world practicality. ICPL also exhibits low computational complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models, but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data, MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a deep learning approach for detecting large individual trees globally using 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery. By simulating tree crowns with scalable Gaussian kernels, the model can accurately identify tree centers and generate binary tree cover maps. Trained on billions of lidar data points, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in tree detection, with an R$^2$ value of 0.81 compared to aerial lidar. The approach demonstrates balanced detection metrics across different biomes and can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However, large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring, and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, real-time rendering, dynamic scenes, Gaussian spheres, training efficiency

Summary: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is crucial for high-fidelity real-time rendering in immersive applications. However, challenges arise when extending 3DGS to dynamic scenes due to the substantial data volume of dense Gaussians and prolonged training times. In response, this paper introduces a scalable framework called \M that enhances training efficiency for streaming tasks. By hierarchically organizing Gaussian spheres within an anchor-based structure, \M efficiently represents both low-resolution structures and high-fidelity details. A hybrid deformation and spawning strategy models motion between frames, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, a bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism removes static regions and prioritizes informative viewpoints during training. Experimental results show that \M achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
Image captioning is essential for various applications but deploying large language models on local devices is challenging. To address this, a specialist based on a smaller language model is explored for lightweight captioning. Despite its smaller size, the specialist performs comparably to large generalists, making it suitable for on-device applications. However, like other large models, it suffers from visual blindness leading to semantic errors. A novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, is developed to improve visual grounding and caption quality by focusing on informative regions. Experiments confirm the specialist's advantages over both small captioning models and large generalists, highlighting the effectiveness of the framework in enhancing caption quality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes, where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of federated FM tuning using brain MRI data.

Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide future method development.

Summary: <br />
Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for neural networks in open-world scenarios. Current methods improve OOD detection by combining feature truncation and scoring functions. By merging state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. The MME score unifies existing OOD detectors into a more effective scoring function. Experiment results on large-scale and small-scale benchmarks demonstrate that MME outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model, MME achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on ImageNet-1K, showing a 6% improvement over the best existing baseline. <div>

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications. Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques: feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions. Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function. Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model, our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance ship detection techniques in remote sensing imagery by tackling the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial patch attacks. The proposed method focuses on localized augmentation, applying augmentation only to target regions to avoid interference with non-target areas. By reducing background interference, the model can better focus on the impact of adversarial patches, leading to improved attack success rates and transferability. Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset validate the effectiveness of this approach in increasing the success rate of adversarial attacks and enhancing their transferability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets. Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH) in large language models for video understanding, particularly in long videos. The ELV-Halluc benchmark is created to address SAH in the context of long videos, showcasing an increase in SAH with semantic complexity. Models are more susceptible to SAH in rapidly changing semantic environments. Positional encoding and DPO strategies are proposed to mitigate SAH, leading to a significant 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio. The study includes experiments confirming the presence of SAH and potential approaches to alleviate it, supported by a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs. These strategies show improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2508.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a method to enhance the representation of fine features in microscopy images using an upsampling convolutional neural network. Feature foundation models, often based on vision transformers, typically struggle with large image sizes and fine details in micrographs. By training a network to upsample low-resolution features derived from the foundation model, the authors are able to improve segmentation and object detection tasks on various microscopy images, including plant cells, lithium-ion battery cathodes, and organic crystals. The upsampled features enable better separation of challenging phases, such as hairline cracks. The approach also facilitates interactive segmentation, allowing for high-quality segmentations with minimal labeling effort compared to traditional convolutional networks. This method demonstrates efficient and effective processing of microscopy images for various applications. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive) segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

arXiv:2508.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM) framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM), which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous, destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach for reconstructing complete 3D scenes using a latent diffusion model with Gaussian splats from a single image. Traditional Gaussian splatting methods struggle with reconstructing occluded and unobserved areas, but the proposed model addresses this challenge by learning a distribution of 3D representations conditioned on a single input image. By using a generative formulation and self-supervised learning with a Variational AutoReconstructor, the model can generate faithful reconstructions and diverse samples, even completing occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings. This new approach outperforms conventional methods by avoiding the blurriness and implausibility associated with predicting a single "mode" for occluded surfaces, offering a more accurate representation of complex scenes. <div>
arXiv:2508.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

<div> Efficient, Pairwise comparison, Annotation, CLIP model, Human-in-the-loop <br /> 
<br />Summary: 
Pairwise comparison is a preferred method for difficult or subjective annotation tasks for its improved reliability, but it can be labor-intensive. A new method called EZ-Sort combines the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model's zero-shot pre-ordering with automated comparisons to reduce human annotation costs by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to previous methods, especially with a dataset of n=100. The approach initilizes bucket-aware Elo scores and employs uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation on face-age estimation, historical image chronology, and retinal image quality assessment datasets demonstrates that EZ-Sort enhances or maintains inter-rater reliability while significantly reducing the annotation burden. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling for scalable and efficient pairwise ranking tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.21550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space, enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI reconstruction.

Summary:<br />
This study explores the transferability of vision-language models (VLMs) to urban scenes, focusing on spatial reasoning. Three VLMs were evaluated, showing reasonable zero-shot performance. However, fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes significantly improved performance, especially on challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals. The dataset was constructed from street-view image predictions paired with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. This study highlights urban spatial reasoning as a novel challenge for VLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of synthetic dataset construction in adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains. Overall, the findings suggest the potential for enhancing VLM performance in urban scene understanding through fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains.

<div> Keywords: temporal dynamics, medical imaging, deep learning, generative trajectory, 4D medical image prediction

Summary: 
Temporal dynamics play a crucial role in medical imaging applications, such as disease progression modeling and treatment planning. Existing deep learning methods often focus on single temporal contexts or specific tasks, limiting their ability to make fine-grained spatial predictions. To address this gap, a new approach called Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) is introduced. TFM is a generative trajectory method that learns underlying temporal distributions and can predict the last context image as a fallback option. It supports 3D volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Benchmarking on three public datasets demonstrates that TFM outperforms other spatio-temporal methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art and robust baseline for 4D medical image prediction.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Summary: 
This study focuses on estimating recurrence risk in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using a combination of preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). The researchers developed a modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling to predict recurrence risk. The results showed that WSI-based models outperformed CT-only models, highlighting the importance of pathology in prognosis. Intermediate fusion of CT and pathology data further improved performance, with the best model approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting that discretization may overstate individualized performance. The study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multiple modalities for personalized ccRCC risk prediction, and suggests exploring more expressive fusion strategies and larger multimodal datasets in the future. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new Deep Unfolding Network for Computer-generated holography (CGH) that addresses existing challenges in accurate and stable reconstruction. It decomposes gradient descent into two modules - an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD). This approach enhances flexibility and interpretability by considering the physical relationships in the reconstruction model. The ABPM module enables wider working distances compared to existing methods, while the PCD module utilizes complex-valued deformable self-attention to capture global features and improve performance, achieving a PSNR of over 35 dB. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature, challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction. Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper, we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

<div> Keywords: PET/CT imaging, lesion segmentation, interactive segmentation, Euclidean Distance Transform, promptable models 

Summary: 
Whole-body PET/CT imaging in oncology often faces challenges in accurately segmenting lesions due to various factors. The autoPET/CT IV challenge introduces interactive segmentation tasks to enhance the accuracy of lesion segmentation. The submission from this work for Task 1 builds upon the nnU-Net pipeline and incorporates user prompts for foreground and background clicks. The study evaluates different representations for spatial prompts and finds that Euclidean Distance Transform encoding outperforms Gaussian kernels consistently. By simulating user interactions online and implementing a customized point sampling strategy, the proposed ensemble of models shows improved performance in cross-validation, reducing false positives and false negatives. These findings demonstrate the potential of promptable models in facilitating efficient user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT imaging. The code for this work is available on GitHub for public access. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity, physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline, we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models. These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient, user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach for constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input by accurately mapping road elements from image space to Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The proposed method includes a probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to refine the mapping and filter out irrelevant elements, improving the alignment with the scene and enhancing HD map generation. The approach also utilizes confidence scores for better temporal processing, selectively accumulating reliable information over time. Experimental results on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show improved performance compared to existing methods, particularly in long perception ranges. The code and model checkpoints for the proposed approach are available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to (i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition, we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Fatih-Erdogan/mapping-like-skeptic .

Summary:  
- Conventional OCR techniques segmented characters leading to errors in character segmentation and limited context usage.  
- Modern techniques in sequence to sequence translation focus on word detection for better language model utilization.   
- Transitioning from word to line-level OCR aims to improve accuracy and efficiency by providing larger sentence context.  
- A curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations is provided to train and benchmark line-level OCR.   
- Experimental results show a 5.4% accuracy improvement and 4 times efficiency enhancement compared to word-based pipelines.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances. Project Website: https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website

<div> Keywords: diffusion-based generative models, object detection, synthetic data generation, Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), efficiency-focused approach

Summary:
Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in supplementing limited datasets for object detection tasks, but often require extensive resources for full fine-tuning. A new approach called Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA) has been introduced to address these challenges by using a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline. By fine-tuning the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), FLORA significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset creation with a consumer-grade GPU. Empirical evaluations on seven different object detection datasets have shown that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by FLORA outperforms models trained on 5000 synthetic images from the baseline method. FLORA achieves up to 21.3% improvement in mAP@.50:.95, demonstrating the effectiveness of a quality and efficiency-focused approach in synthetic data creation for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks. Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on 5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Summary:<br />
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision, but they are susceptible to adversarial perturbations that can cause misclassification. Existing detection methods are either costly or reduce performance on clean data. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages entropy signatures in CNN activations to detect adversarial inputs without modifying the model. By monitoring activation entropy on a VGG-16 network, the researchers found a consistent 7% shift in entropy in early convolutional layers for adversarial inputs, achieving a high detection accuracy of 90% with low false positive and negative rates. The separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions demonstrates that CNNs inherently capture distribution shifts in their activation patterns. This innovation paves the way for real-time deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that can detect adversarial inputs while maintaining original model performance.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However, existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue, however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints. Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Summary:
- Visual sound localization is a crucial task that can be challenging in cases with low audio-visual semantic correspondence, such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds.
- Current methods often struggle in these situations, as they are predominantly evaluated on positive cases with a single visible sound source in the scene.
- The proposed SSL-SaN self-supervised model addresses these shortcomings by incorporating silence and noise during training, leading to improved performance and robustness against negative sounds.
- A new metric is introduced to quantify the alignment and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative audio-visual pairs.
- The IS3+ dataset, an extended and enhanced version of the IS3 synthetic dataset, includes negative audio to further enhance evaluation and training in visual sound localization tasks.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model, SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval. Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However, building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents, featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development. It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning. In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps, and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget' some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant, this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more OOD.

<title>What Can We Learn from Harry Potter? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos</title>

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets, open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset, encouraging further studies in this direction.

<title>Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering</title>

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, without using any labels or class boundaries.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities. Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision (achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1). For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom, heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective, achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized, high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

<title>Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology: Measurable Gains, but Persistent Need for Expert Oversight</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21777</link>

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.

<title>TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available. Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding. In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions. We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today, would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective, distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively across downstream QA tasks.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety, efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity, prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences, as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field, comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms for localization, mapping, perception, and navigation in agricultural robotics. The platform and data collection system is designed to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems, including hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on long trajectories.
  We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing the existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings. The dataset and utilities to work with it are released on https://cifasis.github.io/rosariov2/.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the accompanying code.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD). In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components, which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146 counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations. Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern, radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients; (2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural construction policy-making.

<title>Learning Unified Representations from Heterogeneous Data for Robust Heart Rate Modeling</title>

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.

Abstract: Accurate 3D modeling of human organs is critical for constructing digital phantoms in virtual imaging trials. However, organs such as the large intestine remain particularly challenging due to their complex geometry and shape variability. We propose CLAP, a novel Conditional LAtent Point-diffusion model that combines geometric deep learning with denoising diffusion models to enhance 3D representations of the large intestine. Given point clouds sampled from segmentation masks, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to learn both global and local latent shape representations. Two conditional diffusion models operate within this latent space to refine the organ shape. A pretrained surface reconstruction model is then used to convert the refined point clouds into meshes. CLAP achieves substantial improvements in shape modeling accuracy, reducing Chamfer distance by 26% and Hausdorff distance by 36% relative to the initial suboptimal shapes. This approach offers a robust and extensible solution for high-fidelity organ modeling, with potential applicability to a wide range of anatomical structures.

Abstract: Action recognition (AR) in industrial environments -- particularly for identifying actions and operational gestures -- faces persistent challenges due to high deployment costs, poor cross-scenario generalization, and limited real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a low-cost real-time framework for industrial action recognition using foundation models, denoted as LRIAR, to enhance recognition accuracy and transferability while minimizing human annotation and computational overhead. The proposed framework constructs an automatically labeled dataset by coupling Grounding DINO with the pretrained BLIP-2 image encoder, enabling efficient and scalable action labeling. Leveraging the constructed dataset, we train YOLOv5 for real-time action detection, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier is deceloped via LoRA-based fine-tuning for action classification. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world industrial settings validate the effectiveness of LRIAR, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, scenario generalization, and deployment efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the talking head generation has become a focal point for researchers. Considerable effort is being made to refine lip-sync motion, capture expressive facial expressions, generate natural head poses, and achieve high-quality video. However, no single model has yet achieved equivalence across all quantitative and qualitative metrics. We introduce Jamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba model, to animate a 3D face. Mamba, a pioneering Structured State Space Model (SSM) architecture, was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional Transformer architectures, particularly in handling long sequences. This challenge has constrained traditional models. Jamba combines the advantages of both the Transformer and Mamba approaches, offering a comprehensive solution. Based on the foundational Jamba block, we present JambaTalk to enhance motion variety and lip sync through multimodal integration. Extensive experiments reveal that our method achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Guidance is a widely used technique for diffusion models to enhance sample quality. Technically, guidance is realised by using an auxiliary model that generalises more broadly than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we first show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar but stronger generalisation errors than the primary model. Based on this insight, we introduce \emph{masked sliding window guidance (M-SWG)}, a novel, training-free method. M-SWG upweights long-range spatial dependencies by guiding the primary model with itself by selectively restricting its receptive field. M-SWG requires neither access to model weights from previous iterations, additional training, nor class conditioning. M-SWG achieves a superior Inception score (IS) compared to previous state-of-the-art training-free approaches, without introducing sample oversaturation. In conjunction with existing guidance methods, M-SWG reaches state-of-the-art Frechet DINOv2 distance on ImageNet using EDM2-XXL and DiT-XL. The code is available at https://github.com/HHU-MMBS/swg_bmvc2025_official.

Abstract: Histopathology, the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is essential for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Accurate segmentation and identification of key regions in histopathology images are crucial for developing automated solutions. However, state-of-art deep learning segmentation methods like UNet require extensive labels, which is both costly and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with multiple stainings. To mitigate this, various multi-stain segmentation methods such as UDA-GAN have been developed, which reduce the need for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled. Nonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging, and segmentation models fail when they are unavailable. This article shows that through self-supervised pre-training$-$including SimCLR, BYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO$-$the performance of these segmentation methods (UNet, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably, with self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performance drops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet and 6.2% for UDAGAN, compared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (without pre-training, using 100% labels). Furthermore, these findings are shown to generalise beyond their training distribution to public benchmark datasets. Im-

Abstract: Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is essential for orthodontic treatment, yet manual placement is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge. While machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), none provide a fully end-to-end solution that avoids costly tooth segmentation.
  We present CHaRM (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Methodology), the first fully end-to-end deep learning approach for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS. CHaRM integrates four components: a point cloud encoder, a decoder with a heatmap regression head, a teeth-presence classification head, and the novel CHaR module. The CHaR module leverages teeth-presence information to adapt to missing teeth, improving detection accuracy in complex dental cases. Unlike two-stage workflows that segment teeth before landmarking, CHaRM operates directly on IOS point clouds, reducing complexity, avoiding error propagation, and lowering computational cost.
  We evaluated CHaRM with five point cloud learning backbones on IOSLandmarks-1k, a new dataset of 1,214 annotated 3D dental models. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the scarcity of open data in orthodontics and foster reproducible research.
  CHaRM with PointMLP, named CHaRNet, achieved the best accuracy and efficiency. Compared to state-of-the-art methods (TSMDL and ALIIOS), CHaRNet reduced mean Euclidean distance error to 0.56 mm on standard dental models and 1.12 mm across all dentition type, while delivering up to 14.8x faster inference on GPU. This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, enhances the precision of 3D IOS analysis, and enables efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.

However, existing V2X datasets are limited in scope, diversity, and quality. To address these gaps, we present Mixed Signals, a comprehensive V2X dataset featuring 45.1k point clouds and 240.6k bounding boxes collected from three connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) equipped with two different configurations of LiDAR sensors, plus a roadside unit with dual LiDARs. Our dataset provides point clouds and bounding box annotations across 10 classes, ensuring reliable data for perception training. We provide detailed statistical analysis on the quality of our dataset and extensively benchmark existing V2X methods on it. The Mixed Signals dataset is ready-to-use, with precise alignment and consistent annotations across time and viewpoints. Dataset website is available at https://mixedsignalsdataset.cs.cornell.edu/.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial attention module that can be easily integrated to any convolutional network. This module guides the model to pay attention to the most discriminative part of an image. This enables the model to attain a better performance by an end-to-end training. In conventional approaches, a spatial attention map is typically generated in a position-wise manner. Thus, it is often resulting in irregular boundaries and so can hamper generalization to new samples. In our method, the attention region is constrained to be rectangular. This rectangle is parametrized by only 5 parameters, allowing for a better stability and generalization to new samples. In our experiments, our method systematically outperforms the position-wise counterpart. So that, we provide a novel useful spatial attention mechanism for convolutional models. Besides, our module also provides the interpretability regarding the \textit{where to look} question, as it helps to know the part of the input on which the model focuses to produce the prediction.

<title>Bridging Continuous and Discrete Tokens for Autoregressive Visual Generation</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: RGB-based novel object pose estimation is critical for rapid deployment in robotic applications, yet zero-shot generalization remains a key challenge. In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/foollh/PicoPose.

Abstract: Digital technology plays a crucial role in designing customized medical devices, such as occlusal splints, commonly used in the management of disorders of the stomatognathic system. This methodological proof-of-concept study presents a computer-aided approach for designing and evaluating occlusal positioning splints. The primary aim is to demonstrate the feasibility and geometric accuracy of the proposed method at the preclinical stage. In this approach, a three-dimensional splint is generated using a transformation matrix to represent the therapeutic mandibular position. An experienced operator defines this position using a virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans, and a digitized plaster model. We introduce a novel method for generating splints that reproduces occlusal conditions in the therapeutic position and resolves surface conflicts through virtual embossing. The process for obtaining transformation matrices using dental tools and intraoral devices commonly employed in dental and laboratory workflows is described, and the geometric accuracy of both designed and printed splints is evaluated using profile and surface deviation analysis. The method supports reproducible, patient-specific splint fabrication and provides a transparent foundation for future validation studies, supporting multimodal image registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies in research settings.

Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.

Abstract: Saliency-guided training, which directs model learning to important regions of images, has demonstrated generalization improvements across various biometric presentation attack detection (PAD) tasks. This paper presents its first application to fingerprint PAD. We conducted a 50-participant study to create a dataset of 800 human-annotated fingerprint perceptually-important maps, explored alongside algorithmically-generated "pseudosaliency," including minutiae-based, image quality-based, and autoencoder-based saliency maps. Evaluating on the 2021 Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition testing set, we explore various configurations within five distinct training scenarios to assess the impact of saliency-guided training on accuracy and generalization. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of saliency-guided training for fingerprint PAD in both limited and large data contexts, and we present a configuration capable of earning the first place on the LivDet-2021 benchmark. Our results highlight saliency-guided training's promise for increased model generalization capabilities, its effectiveness when data is limited, and its potential to scale to larger datasets in fingerprint PAD. All collected saliency data and trained models are released with the paper to support reproducible research.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

<title>InterpIoU: Rethinking Bounding Box Regression with Interpolation-Based IoU Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance. However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution, often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU, we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3) supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences. Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&amp;P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical framework that generates prediction intervals or sets with guaranteed coverage probability. While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate a variety of high-quality images by modeling complex data distributions. Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps by approximating the likelihood function within the diffusion reverse sampling process. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches. Code available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/CoDPS.

Abstract: The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep learning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into Bezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks.

Abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. Due to the 3D nature of the world, using multiple camera views and merging them creates better representations for Q-learning and in turn, trains more sample efficient policies. Nevertheless, these multi-view policies are sensitive to failing cameras and can be burdensome to deploy. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while simultaneously disentangling views by augmenting multi-view feature inputs with single-view features. This produces robust policies and allows lightweight deployment. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work.

Abstract: In this paper, we present mmFlux: a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering. This approach generates high-fidelity mmWave flow fields-compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs. In these graphs, edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence enables extraction of key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate mmFlux, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful tools for various tasks, but they often suffer from hallucinations, generating answers not supported by visual input. This paper addresses hallucinations as an alignment problem and introduces CHAIR-DPO, a method that leverages the CHAIR metric to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. By fine-tuning MLLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with the CHAIR-based reward, CHAIR-DPO effectively decreases hallucinated answers on multiple benchmarks. Unlike previous approaches, CHAIR-DPO does not require complex pipelines or proprietary models, making it more accessible. The method demonstrates the importance of aligning MLLMs to prefer generating content without hallucinations, improving the overall performance of these models in various applications. The source code and trained models for CHAIR-DPO are available publicly for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance. Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3, thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image. Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were entirely unseen during training.

Summary: 
Artificial Intelligence models have shown promise in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, but the interpretability of their predictions needs improvement. This study explores the combination of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage to enhance interpretability. MLLMs offer a potentially more understandable way of reasoning for diagnosis, while quantitative attributes related to lesion appearance can improve predictive accuracy. By fine-tuning MLLMs to predict values of these attributes from images, the study demonstrates that the embedding spaces of MLLMs can be grounded in these attributes. An attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset supports this grounding in the embedding space. This research provides a promising approach to enhancing the interpretability of AI models in diagnosing skin diseases. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice. To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g., lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Summary:<br />
Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is essential for various wireless communication applications. Existing solutions for AMR often face challenges like requiring large labeled datasets or complex training pipelines, affecting scalability and generalization. To address this, a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework is proposed, combining supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The framework includes a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier. By incorporating fine-grained I/Q structure and leveraging partial label supervision, the model achieves superior performance on the RML2018.01A dataset with limited labeled data, outperforming baseline models in low-label scenarios and maintaining accuracy across different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Overall, this approach provides a simple, adaptable, and label-efficient solution for automatic modulation recognition.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.

<div> Challenges, Audio-driven human animation, Video generation, Hand motions, Pose-guided refiner <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework called InfinityHuman for audio-driven human animation, addressing challenges in generating high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural hand motions. The proposed method first generates audio-synchronized representations and refines them using a pose-guided refiner to improve video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. The framework decouples pose sequences from appearance to resist error accumulation and temporal degradation, using stable poses and an initial frame as a visual anchor to reduce drift. A hand-specific reward mechanism is introduced to enhance semantic accuracy and gesture realism, trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD and HDTF datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each module. Code will be publicly available for further research and applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts, and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled, resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made public.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new dataset called YT360-EyeTracking for predicting visual saliency in omnidirectional videos (ODVs). The research focuses on incorporating spatial audio cues to enhance saliency prediction in 360-degree environments. Two novel models, SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV, are proposed for this task, with the latter incorporating transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Results show that these models outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention in ODVs. The study suggests that integrating spatial audio cues in the model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in 360-degree videos. The dataset and code for the models will be made available for further research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments, addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking, demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos.

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the need for explainability in vision models by proposing a pipeline that can provide insights at both sample and dataset levels. While existing xAI methods focus on explaining models sample-by-sample, this pipeline aims to analyze the general behavior of vision models on large datasets. By understanding the trends and patterns of vision models on general images, biased judgments can be prevented. The proposed pipeline integrates vision model development with xAI analysis, allowing for the discovery of failure cases and gaining valuable insights with minimal effort. This approach can help advance image analysis by providing a deeper understanding of vision models' behavior. <div>

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated: Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis, southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to 95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Summary:<br />
This study presents a novel framework that combines microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge using customized vision-language representations. By leveraging deep semantic segmentation and pre-trained multi-modal models, the framework encodes visual and textual data into shared representations. A customized similarity-based representation allows for zero-shot classification of unseen microstructures based on expert annotations. Validation on an additively manufactured dataset shows the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples. The FLAVA model offers high visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model aligns consistently with textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts similarity scores for effective alignment and classification. This method improves traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines, enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without retraining models.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Summary:<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network, for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of 0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature. The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG). MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high accuracy in PVS segmentation.

<div> Keywords: CLIP, segmentation, spatial coherence, feedback-driven, attention<br />

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of poor segmentation performance in CLIP due to the lack of spatial coherence in intermediate attention. By developing a training-free, feedback-driven framework, the authors adapt output-based patch-level correspondences back to intermediate attention, enhancing semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions. Key modules such as attention isolation and confidence-based pruning enable sparse adaptation, while an adaptation ensemble effectively provides feedback on output coherence cues. The proposed method integrates seamlessly into state-of-the-art approaches with various backbones and attention types, consistently improving performance across multiple benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2508.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Summary:<br /><br />
In this work, a probing framework is introduced to systematically analyze the processing dynamics of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across layers. By training linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories from token embeddings at each layer, the authors demonstrate a stage-wise structure in MLLMs. Early layers focus on visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. The study also evaluates the probes under three controlled prompt variations to uncover the functional roles of different layers. Results show that the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations, but the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. This work provides insights into the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offers a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks. We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS) enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

To address these challenges, MedFoundationHub, a GUI toolkit, allows users to select and deploy different models easily, ensuring privacy-preserving inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation, copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1) enables physicians to manually select and use different models without programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs (Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases, yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent pathology terminology.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach called Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) for multi-task dense prediction. BIM incorporates Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) mechanisms to efficiently handle cross-task interactions and multi-granularity scene modeling. The BI-Scan constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences using task-first and position-first scanning modes within a linear complexity architecture, preserving critical cross-task information. The MS-Scan mechanism enables multi-granularity scene modeling, meeting diverse task requirements and enhancing cross-task feature interactions. Experimental results on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of BIM compared to existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture, BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, \emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its state-of-the-art competitors.

This study introduces an audio-guided visual editing framework that can handle complex tasks with multiple text and audio prompts without additional training. By leveraging a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities, the framework integrates diverse audio into visual editing tasks. A novel approach is proposed to address complex scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Comprehensive experiments show that the framework excels in handling complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio, where text-only approaches fall short. <div>

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio, where text-only approaches fail.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort, motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated. Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are efficient and fast on neuromorphic hardware and widely used in visual perception tasks. However, current ANN-SNN conversion methods struggle with visual detection tasks. To address this issue, a delay-spike approach is proposed to manage heterogeneous spiking patterns. Additionally, a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture is introduced, allowing neurons to adjust accumulation and firing based on temporal order. This approach enables more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, improving performance and achieving ultra-low latency in object detection and lane line detection tasks. Extensive evaluations show that the tdIF method outperforms current conversion approaches by achieving state-of-the-art performance within 5 time-steps. <div>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks. Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).

<div> dynamic uncertainty propagation, multimodal collaborative reasoning network, salient object detection, small structures, edge regions<br />
<br />Summary: <br />The paper introduces a novel method called DUP-MCRNet for salient object detection, addressing issues of detail loss, edge blurring, and limited fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes. The network includes a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) for uncertainty propagation and channel adaptive interaction, improving accuracy for small structures and edges. A multimodal collaborative fusion strategy (MCF) utilizes modality gating weights to fuse RGB, depth, and edge features, adjusting modality importance based on the scene. This enhances semantic complementarity and consistency between modalities, aiding salient region identification in challenging scenarios. Optimizations include multi-scale loss functions and uncertainty-guided supervision, improving performance at pixel and region levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DUP-MCRNet over existing methods, particularly in edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. <div>

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network (DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets, especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

<div> Keywords: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection, Deep Learning, Multi-Scale Image Features, Feature Pyramid Network, GMVD Dataset

Summary:
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD) is proposed to improve pedestrian detection in bird's eye view from multi-view images. Traditional deep learning methods struggle with detecting pedestrians of varying scales between views. MSMVD addresses this by generating multi-scale bird's eye view features using scale-specific image features from individual views. These multi-scale features enhance the detection of pedestrians with consistent scales in views and vastly different scales between views. By utilizing a feature pyramid network to combine information from different scales of multiple views, MSMVD achieves significant performance improvement over previous methods, surpassing the highest achieved MODA by 4.5 points on the GMVD dataset. This novel approach underscores the importance of leveraging multi-scale image features in multi-view pedestrian detection.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views. Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques, forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across applications like video conferencing and social media. Although state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency, with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

<div> Keywords: medical image classification, dual-model weight selection, self-knowledge distillation, lightweight models, computational efficiency 

Summary: 
This article presents a novel approach to medical image classification that addresses the challenges of deploying large-scale models in resource-constrained environments. The method combines dual-model weight selection and self-knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge efficiently from a pretrained model to lightweight models. By leveraging this strategy, the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency. The dual-model weight selection initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from the pretrained model, allowing for effective knowledge transfer. Self-knowledge distillation is then applied to refine the selected models without adding excessive computational cost. The method is evaluated on various medical image datasets, including chest X-ray images, lung CT scans, and brain MRI scans, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2508.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

<div> Hierarchical feature propagation, lightweight modules, efficient context modeling, LiDAR point clouds, compression ratios <br />
Summary: 
This study proposes a novel framework for compressing LiDAR point clouds efficiently. Two lightweight modules, the Geometry Re-Densification Module and the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module, work together to generate compact features for predictive coding. The Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies sparse geometry, extracts features at a denser scale, and re-sparsifies them for coding, avoiding costly computation on sparse details. The Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to guide feature propagation, reducing redundancy and enriching features. This approach achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, with encoding and decoding both running at 26 FPS for 12-bit quantization. The code for this method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/pengpeng-yu/FastPCC. <br /> <div>

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead. Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding. This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the challenges of data scarcity in the 3D domain and proposes utilizing video data as a supervisory signal for 3D asset generation. By leveraging videos that capture multiple views of objects or scenes and contain rich semantic information, a generative model called Droplet3D is trained on the new Droplet3D-4M dataset. The model supports both image and dense text input, producing spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content. The approach demonstrates improved performance in comparison to existing 3D solutions, showcasing potential for scene-level applications. The open-sourced resources, including the dataset, code, technical framework, and model weights, are made available for further research and development. This study highlights the significance of commonsense priors from videos in enhancing 3D creation processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However, this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities. Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand, videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework, and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

G^2Editor is a new framework for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. It uses a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is utilized to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Hierarchical fine-grained features guide appearance details of the edited object. The method supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a single framework.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate fetal brain segmentation is essential for assessing neurodevelopment, especially in rare conditions like corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD). However, the scarcity of annotated data limits the generalization of deep learning models. This study proposes a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of CCD into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating various brain alterations from healthy data, the approach enables robust segmentation without the need for pathological annotations. The method was validated on a cohort including healthy fetuses and those with CCD and other brain pathologies, showing significant improvements in CCD cases while maintaining performance on other cases. The predicted segmentations allowed for the derivation of clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, which were useful in distinguishing CCD subtypes. The pathology-informed augmentation reduced estimation errors in healthy and CCD cases, resulting in improved topological consistency for shape-based analyses. Overall, this approach effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances the analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.

- Performance of the framework is on par with or better than specialized models in Sign Language Translation, Visual Speech Recognition, Automatic Speech Recognition, and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves SLT performance.

Unlike traditional methods, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, progressively selecting video segments based on evolving understanding and the current question. A novel gated bi-level reward system is introduced to optimize both video segment selection and question comprehension during the reasoning process.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video understanding.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference. While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD. Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers' shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot. CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore, based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

<div> Keywords: Surface anomaly detection, 3D point cloud, Importance-Aware Ensemble Network, Importance-Aware Fusion, MVTec 3D-AD

Summary: 
Surface anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing is crucial for ensuring product quality. While 2D image-based methods have been successful, 3D point cloud-based detection has not been extensively explored due to the lack of powerful pretrained models. To address this gap, the paper proposes the Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), which combines 2D and 3D expert models using an Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module. This module dynamically assesses and reweights the anomaly scores from different sources to improve overall accuracy. Additionally, novel loss functions guide the optimization of IAF to preserve the unique strengths of each source expert. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset show that IAENet achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a significantly lower false positive rate, demonstrating its practical value for industrial deployment.

<br /><br />Summary: Surface anomaly detection is vital in manufacturing, with 2D methods successful but 3D point cloud detection lacking powerful pretrained models. The Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet) combines 2D and 3D expert models using an Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module, dynamically assessing and reweighting anomaly scores. Novel loss functions guide IAF optimization to preserve source expert strengths.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models. However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial: existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate, underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, semantic image editing, DescriptiveEdit, Cross-Attentive UNet, editing accuracy

Summary:<br />
- The article addresses challenges in semantic image editing by introducing a new framework called DescriptiveEdit.
- DescriptiveEdit reframes instruction-based image editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation, utilizing a Cross-Attentive UNet model.
- The framework combines reference images and prompts to enhance the edit-image generation process, improving accuracy and consistency.
- DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in dataset quality and scale compared to existing inversion-based algorithms and instruction-based models.
- The approach integrates seamlessly with other extensions like ControlNet and IP-Adapter, making it more scalable and versatile.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it improves editing accuracy and consistency.

<div> Dual-path feature consistency, confidence-aware sample learning, continual test-time adaptation, pseudo-labels, error accumulation
<br />
Summary: 
DCFS is introduced as a novel framework for Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTTA), addressing challenges in model adaptation to target domain data without access to source data. By leveraging dual-path feature consistency, DCFS disentangles target data features into semantic-related and domain-related features through dual classifiers, ensuring comprehensive feature capture. Confidence-aware sample learning further enhances model performance by calculating per-sample confidence scores, enabling loss-weighted self-supervised learning to reduce pseudo-label noise and mitigate error accumulation. Extensive experimentation across CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C datasets validates DCFS efficacy in CTTA scenarios, demonstrating consistent performance improvements in adapting pre-trained models to new target domains. 
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning. This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation scenarios.

<div> camera calibration, novel view synthesis, 3DGS model, backpropagation, PSNR improvement

Summary:
The paper discusses the importance of camera calibration for novel view synthesis and proposes a method using a 3DGS model to fine-tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss. The study shows that the new calibration alone leads to an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on a reference dataset. While fine-tuning calibration may be time-consuming, it is crucial for scenes like Mip-NeRF 360 where novel view quality is paramount. The quality of calibration directly impacts reconstruction quality, with even small errors having a significant impact. By using a 3DGS model and backpropagation, researchers can ensure more precise calibration and subsequently enhance the quality of novel view synthesis. <div>
arXiv:2508.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness. Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel data-level fusion framework for unsupervised 3D object detection, combining LiDAR data and RGB images at an early stage. By leveraging vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation on images, a bi-directional fusion method is employed to enhance the quality of pseudo-box generation. A local and global filtering method is introduced to address noise from depth and segmentation estimations, improving accuracy. The proposed dynamic self-evolution strategy iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation to enhance localization accuracy. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that the detector trained using this method achieves a significant improvement, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with a 28.4% mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space, while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark.

Summary:
Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images using machine learning models is crucial for rapid weight assessment in scenarios where traditional methods are not feasible. This study presents a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on a large dataset called WayBED, consisting of over 84,000 smartphone images from thousands of individuals. By implementing an automatic filtering process based on posture clustering and person detection, the dataset was curated to include 71,322 high-quality images for training. The resulting model achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on the test set, the lowest reported value in the literature. Furthermore, the model demonstrated robust generalization on an unseen dataset and outperformed existing approaches. The complete pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, was successfully deployed on Android devices using the CLAID framework. The code for model training, filtering, and mobile deployment is released as open-source contributions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from 25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views. This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training, filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source contributions.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557 simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective adaptation of models to medical data.

Summary:
Video object detection is a complex task due to image degradation challenges like motion blur and occlusion. Prior methods have used feature aggregation and post-processing techniques to improve detection performance but have increased computational demands. To address this, a Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) method is proposed, which enhances feature representation without adding to computational load during inference. By implementing a contrastive auxiliary branch with a dynamic loss weighting strategy, CLAB achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet VID dataset with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101 models. The method emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training and gradually shifts focus towards the detection task as training progresses. These results demonstrate consistent performance gains without the need for additional post-processing methods. <div>

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes, making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images. Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101, respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing methods.

<div> Keywords: Typographic attacks, CLIP vision encoders, attention heads, defense method, dyslexic CLIP models 

Summary:
Typographic attacks on multi-modal systems involve injecting text into images to manipulate models. This study examines how the CLIP vision encoders respond to such attacks, identifying specialized attention heads that extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. A defense method is introduced to protect CLIP models by selectively disabling a typographic circuit within attention heads. This approach significantly improves performance on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100 without requiring additional training, while maintaining high accuracy on standard ImageNet-100. The proposed training-free defense method is shown to be competitive with existing typographic defense techniques that involve fine-tuning. The release of dyslexic CLIP models further enhances robustness against typographic attacks, offering a viable solution for safety-critical applications where text manipulation poses a significant risk. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance, and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines. Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

This leads to a 3.5x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining high fidelity in outfit composition. The framework is supported by the DressCode-MR dataset, which contains a large number of high-quality paired images for research purposes. FastFit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity metrics on various datasets (VITON-HD, DressCode, DressCode-MR) and offers significant efficiency in inference speed. <div>

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.

<div> Keywords: thermal camera, neuromorphic vision camera, autonomous driving, event camera, traffic signage<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel approach called UTA-Sign, which combines thermal and event camera technologies to enhance the perception of traffic signage in low-light environments. The thermal camera excels in low-light conditions but struggles with capturing signage, while event cameras detect changes in light intensity effectively. The proposed method utilizes a dual-boosting mechanism to fuse thermal frames and event signals, providing consistent signage representation over time. By aligning thermal frames for motion cues and incorporating subtle signage content from event signals, the method improves the understanding of the environment and enhances signage detection accuracy. Validated on real-world datasets, UTA-Sign demonstrates superior quality in sketching traffic signage and boosts detection accuracy at the perceptual level. <div>

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Summary:<br />
The article proposes an active defense method utilizing low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt deepfake manipulation, focusing on prevention rather than post-event analysis. By targeting the generative process of deepfake techniques through a combination of frequency and spatial domain features, the method reduces the effectiveness and naturalness of face swapping. The architecture includes an encoder, perturbation generator, and decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet transform to produce disruptions while maintaining visual plausibility. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate a significant decrease in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality. <div>

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation, reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Summary:
Diverse-T2M is a novel text-to-motion generation method that aims to improve diversity in generated human motions while maintaining text consistency. The approach introduces uncertainty into the generation process, using noise signals to facilitate explicit modeling of uncertainty in transformer-based methods. By constructing a latent space for text representation and incorporating a latent space sampler for stochastic sampling, Diverse-T2M enhances the diversity and uncertainty of generated motions. Results on benchmark datasets show that the method significantly improves diversity while retaining state-of-the-art text consistency. <div>
arXiv:2508.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text. Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in text consistency.

Summary: 
<br />
In liver surgery, interpreting intraoperative ultrasound images is challenging due to limited view and complex anatomy. A solution using 3D IntraVascular Ultrasound (IVUS) for organ reconstruction can bridge preoperative and intraoperative data, aiding surgical guidance. The proposed optimization-based calibration method, using a 3D-printed phantom, ensures precise alignment of IVUS data with preoperative CT images. Validation on swine liver images resulted in calibration errors of 0.88-1.80 mm and registration errors of 3.40-5.71 mm. This method offers accurate calibration and volume reconstruction, facilitating the registration of intraoperative ultrasound images with preoperative CT scans in liver surgery, thereby improving intraoperative navigation and guidance.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ, which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.

The paper discusses Split Inference (SI) as a collaborative paradigm for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduce latency and protect user privacy.

The proposed GAN-based DRA framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) enhances reconstructed image quality by refining intermediate representations.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy. However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors, limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios, out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling, emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page: https://github.com/GVCLab/EmoCAST

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection, particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers, acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/bcnaim-odelia-challenge.git.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians, offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent, and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence. We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after" paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order. Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off. Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications.

<title>CardioMorphNet: Cardiac Motion Prediction Using a Shape-Guided Bayesian Recurrent Deep Network</title>

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities. Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods, indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2. The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

<title>Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20751</link>

arXiv:2508.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens when minimal score differences between images are amplified after normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM, and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally, existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability.

<title>SeqVLM: Proposal-Guided Multi-View Sequences Reasoning via VLM for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements. However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability.

<title>Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model performance.

<title>Looking Beyond the Obvious: A Survey on Abstract Concept Recognition for Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.

<title>Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations. To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training</title>

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets, indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization. To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition, Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.

<title>Understanding and evaluating computer vision models through the lens of counterfactuals</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution (LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular, training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow. We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust, generalizable, and interpretable perception.

<title>Dino U-Net: Exploiting High-Fidelity Dense Features from Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/yifangao112/DinoUNet.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading. Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult, as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

arXiv:2508.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy performance under different complexity configurations. The three core innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization capability.

Abstract: We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for realistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using incremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite dynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By integrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction and photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs) and controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object motion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process. DrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and generates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing scene diversity.

arXiv:2508.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization. Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods, offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at https://github.com/patrick-bedkowski/expertsim-mix-of-generative-experts.

<title>ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2508.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

<title>POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency, we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models, where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples. Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations. First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second, they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available at https://github.com/DAIR-Group/FW-GAN

<title>MMG-Vid: Maximizing Marginal Gains at Segment-level and Token-level for Efficient Video LLMs</title>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically, we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/CogVLA.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle, localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world applications.

<title>OneReward: Unified Mask-Guided Image Generation via Multi-Task Human Preference Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21066</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model. By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: We present Dress&amp;Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&amp;Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

<title>First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal Challenge</title>

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge. The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track, depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain. Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation.

Abstract: Ear diseases affect billions of people worldwide, leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burdens. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. The objective of this study is to present the establishment and design of UltraEar Database, a large-scale, multicentric repository of isotropic 0.1 mm ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images and associated clinical data dedicated to ear diseases. UltraEar recruits patients from 11 tertiary hospitals between October 2020 and October 2035, integrating U-HRCT images, structured CT reports, and comprehensive clinical information, including demographics, audiometric profiles, surgical records, and pathological findings. A broad spectrum of otologic disorders is covered, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, ossicular chain malformation, temporal bone fracture, inner ear malformation, cochlear aperture stenosis, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, and sigmoid sinus bony deficiency. Standardized preprocessing pipelines have been developed for geometric calibration, image annotation, and multi-structure segmentation. All personal identifiers in DICOM headers and metadata are removed or anonymized to ensure compliance with data privacy regulation. Data collection and curation are coordinated through monthly expert panel meetings, with secure storage on an offline cloud system. UltraEar provides an unprecedented ultra-high-resolution reference atlas with both technical fidelity and clinical relevance. This resource has significant potential to advance radiological research, enable development and validation of AI algorithms, serve as an educational tool for training in otologic imaging, and support multi-institutional collaborative studies. UltraEar will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring long-term accessibility and usability for the global otologic research community.

<title>The Role of Teacher Calibration in Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore, we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.

<title>GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

<title>Federated Learning for Large Models in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Review</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets. This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization. These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images. We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a valuable reference for the field's development.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis. This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT) images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex, smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of 0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758). Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation studies indicated complementary information from different modalities. Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code is available at https://github.com/sejmoonwei/SPGrasp.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF) classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction, and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary 3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints. ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation. Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.
